# Programming with ATL and C Run-Time Code
This section discusses the benefits of using the C Run-Time Library (CRT) with either static or dynamic linking.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Benefits and Tradeoffs of the Method Used to Link to the CRT](../VS_visualcpp/Benefits-and-Tradeoffs-of-the-Method-Used-to-Link-to-the-CRT.md)  
 Summarizes the benefits and tradeoffs involved in linking statically to the CRT or linking dynamically.  
  
 [Linking to the CRT in Your ATL Project](../VS_visualcpp/Linking-to-the-CRT-in-Your-ATL-Project.md)  
 Discusses the project settings and linker options for linking to the CRT; also provides details on how linking to the CRT affects your program image.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [ATL](../VS_visualcpp/Active-Template-Library--ATL--Concepts.md)  
 Provides links to conceptual topics on how to program using the Active Template Library.  
  
 [Run-Time Library Behavior](../VS_visualcpp/Run-Time-Library-Behavior.md)  
 Provides details on how the CRT startup code works.  
  
 [C Run-Time Libraries](../VS_visualcpp/CRT-Library-Features.md)  
 Discusses the various .lib files that comprise the C run-time libraries and lists their associated compiler options and preprocessor directives.
