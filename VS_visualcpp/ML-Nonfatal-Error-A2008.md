# ML Nonfatal Error A2008
**syntax error :**  
  
 A token at the current location caused a syntax error.  
  
 One of the following may have occurred:  
  
-   A dot prefix was added to or omitted from a directive.  
  
-   A reserved word (such as **C** or **SIZE**) was used as an identifier.  
  
-   An instruction was used that was not available with the current processor or coprocessor selection.  
  
-   A comparison run-time operator (such as `==`) was used in a conditional assembly statement instead of a relational operator (such as [EQ](../VS_visualcpp/operator-EQ.md)).  
  
-   An instruction or directive was given too few operands.  
  
-   An obsolete directive was used.
