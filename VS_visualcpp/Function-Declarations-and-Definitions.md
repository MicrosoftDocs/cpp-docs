# Function Declarations and Definitions
Function prototypes establish the name of the function, its return type, and the type and number of its formal parameters. A function definition includes the function body.  
  
## Remarks  
 Both function and variable declarations can appear inside or outside a function definition. Any declaration within a function definition is said to appear at the "internal" or "local" level. A declaration outside all function definitions is said to appear at the "external," "global," or "file scope" level. Variable definitions, like declarations, can appear at the internal level (within a function definition) or at the external level (outside all function definitions). Function definitions always occur at the external level. Function definitions are discussed further in [Function Definitions](../VS_visualcpp/C-Function-Definitions.md). Function prototypes are covered in [Function Prototypes](../VS_visualcpp/Function-Prototypes.md).
