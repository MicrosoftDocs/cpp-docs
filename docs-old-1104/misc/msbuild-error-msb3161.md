# MSBuild Error MSB3161
**MSB3161: A circular dependency was detected between the following built packages: '\<package>'**  
  
 This warning is generated when there is a circular dependency in the graph of the bootstrapper package dependencies (for example: A→B→C→A). In such cases the bootstrapper cannot determine which package to install first.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the circular dependency, either by changing the dependencies described in the bootstrapper package files or by not installing one of the interdependent packages.
