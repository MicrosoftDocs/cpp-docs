 `<Name>[Localized version of the type name, this is the rule name that appears in the UI]</Name>`  
  
 `<Description>[A sentence describing the rule in more detail than the name].</Description>`  
  
 `<Url>[A URL pointing to a documentation or info about the rule]</Url>`  
  
 `<Resolution>[Format string for rule messages].</Resolution>`
