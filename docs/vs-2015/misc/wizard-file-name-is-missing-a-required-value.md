# Wizard file &lt;name&gt; is missing a required value.
The .vsz file for the wizard does not have the correct format. This error occurs when a .vsz file is corrupted or if the file is from a product other than Visual Studio.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Verify that the wizard is a Visual Studio wizard and try again.  
  
     —or—  
  
     Re-install Visual Studio to replace the corrupted file.
