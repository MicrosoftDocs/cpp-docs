# Visual Studio IDE Concepts
The topics in this section describe the overall structure of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] and the integrated development environment (IDE). Other topics explain VSPackages and services, and how to create and use them.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Visual Studio Extensibility Architecture](../misc/visual-studio-extensibility-architecture.md)  
 Discusses the extensibility architecture, whose command-handling and routing scheme gives users an open framework to make easy access to both existing and installed command sets possible.  
  
 [Implementation Strategies](../misc/implementation-strategies.md)  
 Describes the extension of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by using add-ins or VSPackages, or a combination of both.  
  
 [The Experimental Instance](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ead0df4e-6f88-4b42-9297-581b7902f050)  
 Explains the experimental build of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. When you develop an application that might change [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../includes/vsipsdk-md.md)] provides the experimental build for you to use instead of the released build.  
  
 [Visual Studio Shell](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cb124ef4-1a6b-4bfe-bfbf-295ef9c07f36)  
 Describes the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] IDE, which is the primary agent of integration in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
 [Visual Studio SDK and Automation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/918cf97f-53f4-4fb5-8639-88f0b2852846)  
 Discusses using automation, VSPackages, or a combination to create [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] extensibility applications.  
  
 [Visual Studio SDK and Managed Code](../misc/visual-studio-sdk-and-managed-code.md)  
 Compares the different ways to write a VSPackage in managed code.
