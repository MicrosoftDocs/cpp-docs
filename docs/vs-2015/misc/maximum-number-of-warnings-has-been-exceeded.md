# Maximum number of warnings has been exceeded
The maximum number of compilation warnings is 100. The compiler imposes this limit to reduce the size of error and warning reports.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/99cf4781-bd4d-47b4-91b9-217933509f82).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42206  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Review the other warnings generated by this compilation and resolve as many as possible. If the source code contains more than 100 warnings, you might see more warnings in the next compilation.
