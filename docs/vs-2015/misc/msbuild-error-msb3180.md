# MSBuild Error MSB3180
**MSB3180: COM component '\<assembly>' is defined in both '\<file>' and '\<file>', clsid/tlbid="'\<assembly>'".**  
  
 This error is generated by the application manifest generation process when duplicate COM references (to classes or type libraries) are found either in file references or in dependent manifests.  
  
 For example, you could receive this error if you added a reference to a COM object with an external manifest and a reference to the same COM object with an internal manifest.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove one of the duplicate COM references.
