# Managed VSPackages
The following topics explain how to create a VSPackage. A VSPackage is a software module that extends the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) by providing user interface (UI) elements, services, projects, editors, and designers. For more information, see [VSPackages](../Topic/VSPackages.md).

 [VSPackages and the Managed Package Framework](../misc/vspackages-and-the-managed-package-framework.md)  
 Describes and lists the managed package framework (MPF) class namespaces and DLL files and shows how to use them to create a VSPackage.  
  
 [Resources in VSPackages](../Topic/Resources%20in%20VSPackages.md)
