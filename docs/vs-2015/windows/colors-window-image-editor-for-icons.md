# Colors Window (Image Editor for Icons)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Colors Window (Image Editor for Icons)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/colors-window-image-editor-for-icons).  
  
  
The Colors window has two parts:  
  
1.  The Colors Palette, which is an array of color samples that represent colors you can use. You can click the samples to select foreground and background colors when you are using the graphics tools.  
  
2.  The Color Indicator, which shows the foreground and background colors and selectors for screen and inverse color.

> [!NOTE]
>  The **Screen color** and **Inverse color** tools are only available for icons and cursors.  
  
 You can use the Colors window with the [Image Editor toolbar](../mfc/toolbar-image-editor-for-icons.md).
