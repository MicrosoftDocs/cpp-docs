# MFC Technical Notes
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [MFC Technical Notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/mfc-technical-notes).  
  
  
A technical note is a document written for programmers by programmers.  
  
 Each technical note describes a problem or feature that is beyond the scope of the rest of the MFC documentation. The technical notes supplied reflect requests for information from users, as well as specialized information that the MFC developers anticipate advanced users will want.  
  
 There are two ways to browse through the technical notes:  
  
-   [Technical Notes By Number](../mfc/technical-notes-by-number.md)  
  
-   [Technical Notes By Category](../mfc/technical-notes-by-category.md)
