# Compiler Error C3483
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Compiler Error C3483](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-2/compiler-error-c3483).  
  
  
var' is already part of the lambda capture list  
  
 You passed the same variable to the capture list of a lambda expression more than one time.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove all additional instances of the variable from the capture list.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates C3483 because the variable `n` appears more than one time in the capture list of the lambda expression:  
  
```  
// C3483.cpp  
  
int main()  
{  
   int m = 6, n = 5;  
   [m,n,n] { return n + m; }(); // C3483  
}  
```
