''' <summary>
''' This is the class that implements the package exposed by this assembly.
'''
''' The minimum requirement for a class to be considered a valid package for Visual Studio
''' is to implement the IVsPackage interface and register itself with the shell.
''' This package uses the helper classes defined inside the Managed Package Framework (MPF)
''' to do it: it derives from the Package class that provides the implementation of the 
''' IVsPackage interface and uses the registration attributes defined in the framework to 
''' register itself and its components with the shell.
''' </summary>
' The PackageRegistration attribute tells the PkgDef creation utility (CreatePkgDef.exe) that this class
' is a package.
'
' The InstalledProductRegistration attribute is used to register the information needed to show this package
' in the Help/About dialog of Visual Studio.
