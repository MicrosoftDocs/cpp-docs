# Container Class::const_reverse_iterator
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Container Class::const_reverse_iterator](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/container-class-const-reverse-iterator).  
  
NOTE]
>  This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the Standard C++ Library. For more information, see [STL Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).  
  
 Describes an object that can serve as a constant reverse iterator for the controlled sequence.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
 
typedef T8 const_reverse_iterator;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type **T8** (typically [reverse_iterator](../standard-library/container-class-reverse-iterator.md) <[const_iterator](../standard-library/container-class-const-iterator.md)`>`).
