# __vmx_vmclear

**Microsoft Specific**

Initializes the specified virtual machine control structure (VMCS) and sets its launch state to `Clear`.

## Syntax

```
unsigned char __vmx_vmclear(
   unsigned __int64 *VmcsPhysicalAddress
);
```

#### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|*VmcsPhysicalAddress*|[in] A pointer to a 64-bit memory location that contains the physical address of the VMCS to clear.|

## Return Value

|Value|Meaning|
|-----------|-------------|
|0|The operation succeeded.|
|1|The operation failed with extended status available in the `VM-instruction error field` of the current VMCS.|
|2|The operation failed without status available.|

## Remarks

An application can perform a VM-enter operation by using either the [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) or [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function. The [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) function can be used only with a VMCS whose launch state is `Clear`, and the [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function can be used only with a VMCS whose launch state is `Launched`. Consequently, use the [__vmx_vmclear](../intrinsics/vmx-vmclear.md) function to set the launch state of a VMCS to `Clear`. Use the [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) function for your first VM-enter operation and the [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function for subsequent VM-enter operations.

The `__vmx_vmclear` function is equivalent to the `VMCLEAR` machine instruction. This function supports the interaction of a host's virtual machine monitor with a guest operating system and its applications.
