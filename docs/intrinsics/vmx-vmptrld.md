# __vmx_vmptrld

**Microsoft Specific**

Loads the pointer to the current virtual-machine control structure (VMCS) from the specified address.

## Syntax

```
int __vmx_vmptrld(
   unsigned __int64 *VmcsPhysicalAddress
);
```

### Parameters

*VmcsPhysicalAddress*<br/>
[in] The address where the VMCS pointer is stored.

## Return Value

0<br/>
The operation succeeded.

1<br/>
The operation failed with extended status available in the `VM-instruction error field` of the current VMCS.

2<br/>
The operation failed without status available.

## Remarks

The VMCS pointer is a 64-bit physical address.

The `__vmx_vmptrld` function is equivalent to the `VMPTRLD` machine instruction. This function supports the interaction of a host's virtual machine monitor with a guest operating system and its applications.
