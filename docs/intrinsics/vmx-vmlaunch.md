# __vmx_vmlaunch
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Places the calling application in VMX non-root operation state (VM enter) by using the current virtual-machine control structure (VMCS).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
unsigned char __vmx_vmlaunch(  
   void);  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|Value|Meaning|  
|-----------|-------------|  
|0|The operation succeeded.|  
|1|The operation failed with extended status available in the `VM-instruction error field` of the current VMCS.|  
|2|The operation failed without status available.|  
  
## Remarks  
 An application can perform a VM-enter operation by using either the [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) or [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function. The [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) function can be used only with a VMCS whose launch state is `Clear`, and the [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function can be used only with a VMCS whose launch state is `Launched`. Consequently, use the [__vmx_vmclear](../intrinsics/vmx-vmclear.md) function to set the launch state of a VMCS to `Clear`, and then use the [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) function for your first VM-enter operation and the [__vmx_vmresume](../intrinsics/vmx-vmresume.md) function for subsequent VM-enter operations.  
  
 The `__vmx_vmlaunch` function is equivalent to the `VMLAUNCH` machine instruction. This function supports the interaction of a host's virtual machine monitor with a guest operating system and its applications.
