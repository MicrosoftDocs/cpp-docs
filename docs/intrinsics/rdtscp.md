# __rdtscp

**Microsoft Specific**

Generates the `rdtscp` instruction, writes `TSC_AUX[31:0]` to memory, and returns the 64-bit Time Stamp Counter (TSC) result.

## Syntax

```C
unsigned __int64 __rdtscp(
   unsigned int * AUX
);
```

### Parameters

*AUX*\
[out] Pointer to a location that will contain the contents of the machine-specific register `TSC_AUX[31:0]`.

## Return value

A 64-bit unsigned integer tick count.

## Requirements

|Intrinsic|Architecture|
|---------------|------------------|
|`__rdtscp`|x86, x64|

**Header file** \<intrin.h>

## Remarks

The `__rdtscp` intrinsic generates the `rdtscp` instruction. To determine hardware support for this instruction, call the `__cpuid` intrinsic with `InfoType=0x80000001` and check bit 27 of `CPUInfo[3] (EDX)`. This bit is 1 if the instruction is supported, and 0 otherwise. If you run code that uses the intrinsic on hardware that doesn't support the `rdtscp` instruction, the results are unpredictable.

This instruction waits until all previous instructions have executed and all previous loads are globally visible. However, it isn't a serializing instruction. For more information, see the Intel and AMD manuals.

The meaning of the value in `TSC_AUX[31:0]` depends on the operating system.

## Example

```cpp
#include <intrin.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    unsigned __int64 i;
    unsigned int ui;
    i = __rdtscp(&ui);
    printf_s("%I64d ticks\n", i);
    printf_s("TSC_AUX was %x\n", ui);
}
```

```Output
3363423610155519 ticks
TSC_AUX was 0
```
