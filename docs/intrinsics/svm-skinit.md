# __svm_skinit
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Initiates the loading of verifiably secure software, such as a virtual machine monitor.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
void __svm_skinit(  
   int SLB  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`SLB`|The 32-bit physical address of a 64K byte Secure Loader Block (SLB).|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `__svm_skinit` function is equivalent to the `SKINIT` machine instruction. This function is part of a security system that uses the processor and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to verify and load trusted software called a security kernel (SK). A virtual machine monitor is an example of a security kernel. The security system verifies program components loaded during the initialization process, and protects components from tampering by interrupts, device access, or another program if the computer is a multiprocessor.  
  
 The `SLB` parameter specifies the physical address of a 64K block of memory called the *Secure Loader Block* (SLB). The SLB contains a program called the secure loader that establishes the operating environment for the computer, and subsequently loads the security kernel.  
  
 This function supports the interaction of a host's virtual machine monitor with a guest operating system and its applications.
