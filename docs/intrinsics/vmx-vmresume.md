# __vmx_vmresume
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Resumes VMX non-root operation by using the current virtual machine control structure (VMCS).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
unsigned char __vmx_vmresume(  
   void);  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|Value|Meaning|  
|-----------|-------------|  
|0|The operation succeeded.|  
|1|The operation failed with extended status available in the `VM-instruction error field` of the current VMCS.|  
|2|The operation failed without status available.|  
  
## Remarks  
 An application can perform a VM-enter operation by using either the [__vmx_vmlaunch](../intrinsics/vmx-vmlaunch.md) or `__vmx_vmresume` function. The `__vmx_vmlaunch` function can be used only with a VMCS whose launch state is `Clear`, and the `__vmx_vmresume` function can be used only with a VMCS whose launch state is `Launched`. Consequently, use the [__vmx_vmclear](../intrinsics/vmx-vmclear.md) function to set the launch state of a VMCS to `Clear`, and then use the `__vmx_vmlaunch` function for your first VM-enter operation and the `__vmx_vmresume` function for subsequent VM-enter operations.  
  
 The `__vmx_vmresume` function is equivalent to the `VMRESUME` machine instruction. This function supports the interaction of a host's virtual machine monitor with a guest operating system and its applications.
