# Could not generate the binary licenses file. The output file &#39;file&#39; could not be opened. &lt;reason&gt;
An outdated copy of the licenses file could not be deleted by the project system. As part of preparing licenses, the project system will transform text .licx files into binary licenses files that are understood by the .NET licensing system.
