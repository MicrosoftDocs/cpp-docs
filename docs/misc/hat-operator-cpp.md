# ^ operator (C++)
The `^` operator has two meanings in Visual C++, depending on its context. For more information see:  
  
-   [Bitwise Exclusive OR Operator: ^](../cpp/bitwise-exclusive-or-operator-hat.md), for use in all flavors of C++.  
  
-   [Handle to Object Operator (^)](../windows/handle-to-object-operator-hat-cpp-component-extensions.md), for use in [!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../build/reference/includes/cppwrt_short_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cppcli](../build/reference/includes/cppcli_md.md)]
