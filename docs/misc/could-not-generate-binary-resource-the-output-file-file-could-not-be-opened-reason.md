# Could not generate binary resource. The output file &#39;file&#39; could not be opened. &lt;reason&gt;
An outdated copy of the .resources file could not be deleted by the project system. As part of preparing resources, the project system will transform XML files with a .resx extension into binary .resources files for the .NET Resource Manager.  
  
 The operating-system specific reason given at the end of the error message text will provide best information here.  
  
 **To correct this error**  
  
-   Restart [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../assembler/masm/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
     This error will cause the build process to fail.
