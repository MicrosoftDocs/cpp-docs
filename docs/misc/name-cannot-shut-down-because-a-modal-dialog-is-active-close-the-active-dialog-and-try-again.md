# &lt;name&gt; cannot shut down because a modal dialog is active. Close the active dialog and try again.
This error generally occurs when the operating system is attempting to shut down and a modal dialog is open in an application, which prevents the application from closing.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Close the modal dialog box and then close the application or shut down the operating system.
