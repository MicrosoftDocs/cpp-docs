# MSBuild Error MSB4134
**MSB4134: DefaultToolsVersion cannot be set after a project has been loaded into the Engine.**  
  
 This error occurs when an attempt to change the value of `DefaultToolsVersion` is made after [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../build/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] already has built a project.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Change the value of `DefaultToolsVersion` before you build a project.
