 This warning can occur in one of the following situations:  
  
-   If you encounter this warning in conjunction with CA0063 warnings, there was an a problem loading your ruleset file. For more information, see the [CA0063](../misc/ca0063.md) documentation.  
  
-   If you encountered this error in conjunction with CA0062 warnings, it most likely that Code Analysis was unable to find the assembly or assemblies that contain the rules specified by the ruleset. For more information, see the [CA0062](../misc/ca0062.md) documentation.  
  
-   Otherwise, this warning usually occurs when your ruleset is empty or all of the rule enabled in child ruleset have been disabled. Use the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../misc/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)] ruleset editor to enable some rules in your ruleset. For more information, see [Creating Custom Rule Sets](/visualstudio/code-quality/creating-custom-code-analysis-rule-sets).
