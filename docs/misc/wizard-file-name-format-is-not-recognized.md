# Wizard file &lt;name&gt; format is not recognized.
The wizard cannot be opened. This error is generally caused by a corrupted wizard file or a wizard that does not match the version number of Visual Studio.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Verify that the wizard file has the same version number as the version of Visual Studio listed as the value of VSWIZARD, such as `VSWIZARD 7.0`.  
  
     —or—  
  
     Re-install Visual Studio to repair the corrupted file.
