# Port, Migrate, and Upgrade Visual Studio Projects in Visual Studio &quot;15&quot; RC
When you move to a newer version of Visual Studio, you'll want to know if  you must modify any of the solutions, projects, files, and other assets that you created in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)] before you run them in either [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev15_md](../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)]. This page can help you with that. 

> [!NOTE]
>  You might have reached this page if you received an error message when you tried to open a project that isn't supported in the Visual Studio version that you opened it in, or if it requires an SDK or extension, such as the Azure SDK for .NET. If so, this page can help you with that, too.
  
 Many widely used assets behave the same in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev15_md](../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)], and the two earlier versions. For example, in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev15_md](../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)], you can open a project that was created in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], change it, and then reopen it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev15_md](../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)]; your changes persist and the project behaves the same as it does in the earlier version. The same is true for many assets that were created in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)].  
  
 If you use [!INCLUDE[vs_dev15_md](../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)] together with [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], you can create and modify projects and files in any of the versions. You can transfer projects and files among the versions as long as you don't add features that are not supported by one of the versions.  
  
##  <a name="project"></a> Projects  
 The following list describes support in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev15_md](../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] for projects that were created in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)]  or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)]. You can use this list to help determine whether you can open a project as-is in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev15_md](../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], or whether you have to modify it to ensure that it's compatible.  
  
|Type of Project|Compatibility|  
|---------------------|-------------------|  
|Universal Windows Platform apps|To install the tools Universal Windows apps, in Visual Studio setup, select **Custom** or **Modify**, and then select **Universal Windows App Development Tools**.<br /><br /> Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app development for Windows 10 is supported only in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] on Windows 10 or [!INCLUDE[win81](../misc/includes/win81_md.md)].|  
|Windows Store apps|Windows Store app development, including Universal apps that target both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1, is supported on [!INCLUDE[win81](../misc/includes/win81_md.md)] and Windows 10. Existing [!INCLUDE[win8](../build/reference/includes/win8_md.md)] projects can continue to be serviced, but new [!INCLUDE[win8](../build/reference/includes/win8_md.md)] projects cannot be created. [!INCLUDE[win81](../misc/includes/win81_md.md)] projects can depend only on certain types of references. For more information, see [Managing references in a project](/visual-studio/ide/managing-references-in-a-project). **Note:**  [!INCLUDE[win81](../misc/includes/win81_md.md)] projects that you create by using [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] cannot be opened in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)]. That is because [!INCLUDE[win81](../misc/includes/win81_md.md)] projects created by using [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] target those versions, and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)] supports only [!INCLUDE[win8](../build/reference/includes/win8_md.md)] projects that target [!INCLUDE[win8](../build/reference/includes/win8_md.md)].|  
|[!INCLUDE[net_v451](../misc/includes/net_v451_md.md)]|You can create and use these projects in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] after you install the appropriate multi-targeting pack. These projects are not supported in Visual Studio 2010 SP1.|  
|[!INCLUDE[net_v45](../misc/includes/net_v45_md.md)]|You can create and open these projects in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], but not in Visual Studio 2010 SP1. For more information, see [Migration Guide](../Topic/Migration%20Guide%20to%20the%20.NET%20Framework%204.6%20and%204.5%20.md)|  
|BizTalk|BizTalk server projects are not compatible with [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)].|  
|C#/Visual Basic Silverlight 4 Application or Class Library|If you allow Visual Studio to update the project automatically, you can open it in either [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)].|  
|C#/Visual Basic Webform or Windows Form|You can open the project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)].|  
|Visual Basic 6 and Visual C++ 6|Visual Studio 2012 and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] do not support debugging applications built with Visual Basic 6 or Visual C++ 6; to debug these applications, use earlier versions of Visual Studio.|  
|Coded UI test|If you allow Visual Studio to update the project automatically, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1.|  
|F#|If you allow Visual Studio to upgrade a project that was created in Visual Studio 2010 SP1, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)]. However, you can’t upgrade a Silverlight project that was created in an older version of Visual Studio to [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)]. Instead, you must create a Silverlight project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] and then copy your code into it. Silverlight projects that you create in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] target Silverlight 5.|  
|LightSwitch|If you allow Visual Studio to upgrade the project automatically, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] only.|  
|Local Database Cache|The Local Database Cache template and the **Configure Data Synchronization** dialog box are not included in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)]. You can use [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] to open and run projects that were created in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../misc/includes/vs2010_md.md)] if Microsoft Synchronization Services v1.0 is installed, but if you want to update them in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], you must make all changes manually in code. As an alternative, you can continue to use [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../misc/includes/vs2010_md.md)] to maintain and update these projects.  For new development, target the new synchronization model that's provided by the Microsoft Sync Framework. For information, see [Microsoft Sync Framework Developer Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/sync/default)|  
|Model-View-Controller framework|Visual Studio 2010 SP1 supports only MVC 2 and MVC 3, [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)] supports only MVC 3 and MVC 4, and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] supports only MVC 4. For information about how to automatically upgrade from MVC 2 to MCV 3, see [ASP.NET MVC 3 Application Upgrader](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=238178). For information about how to manually upgrade from MVC 2 to MVC 3, see [Upgrading an ASP.NET MVC 2 Project to ASP.NET MVC 3 Tools Update](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=238178). For information about how to manually upgrade from MVC3 to MVC 4, see [Upgrading an ASP.NET MVC 3 Project to ASP.NET MVC 4](http://www.asp.net/whitepapers/mvc4-release-notes). If your project targets the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, you must retarget it to use the .NET Framework 4.|  
|Modeling|If you allow Visual Studio to update the project automatically, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], or Visual Studio 2010 SP1.<br /><br /> When Team Foundation builds a modeling project, it tries to validate the layers in the project. In [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], Team Foundation Build can't validate the layers for a modeling project that was created in Visual Studio 2010 SP1. However, in Visual Studio 2010 SP1, Team Foundation Build can validate the layers in a modeling project that was created in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)].|  
|MPI/Cluster Debugging|If the same version of the runtime or tools is installed on the computers that are running [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], or Visual Studio 2010 SP1, you can open this project in all three versions.|  
|MSI setup (.vdproj)|This project can't be opened in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] because it doesn't support that project type. We recommend that you use InstallShield Limited Edition for Visual Studio (ISLE), a free deployment solution that directly supports most Windows platforms and application runtimes. You can also use ISLE to import data and settings from Visual Studio Installer projects. .|  
|Office 2007 VSTO|If you upgrade the project to target Office 2013 and the .NET Framework 4, you can open this project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], or Visual Studio 2010 SP1.|  
|Office 2010 VSTO|If the project targets the .NET Framework 4, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1. All other projects require a one-way upgrade.|  
|Rich Internet Applications|If you upgrade the project, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1.|  
|SharePoint 2007|This project can't be opened in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)]. However, if you manually upgrade the project to SharePoint 2010, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1. For more information about how to upgrade SharePoint 2007, see [Migrating from SharePoint 2007 to SharePoint 2010 for the IT Pro](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238224), [Migrating a 2007 Workflow to Visual Studio & SharePoint 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238225), and [SharePoint Enterprise Search Migration Tool for SharePoint Server 2010](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238226).|  
|SharePoint 2010|You can open the project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1.|  
|SketchFlow|If you allow Visual Studio to upgrade the project to WPF 4.5/Silverlight 5, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)].|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssKatmai_exp](../misc/includes/sskatmai_exp_md.md)] database|You can open the project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1. If you have a database file (.mdf) that was created in an earlier version of SQL Server, you must upgrade it to [!INCLUDE[sql_Denali_long](../misc/includes/sql_denali_long_md.md)] before you can use it with SQL Server Express LocalDB, but the database is no longer compatible with earlier versions of SQL Server. If you don’t upgrade, you can continue to work with the database in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] by installing and using [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai_exp](../misc/includes/sskatmai_exp_md.md)] on the same computer. For more information, see [Upgrade .mdf files](/visual-studio/data-tools/upgrade-dot-mdf-files).|  
|[!INCLUDE[sskatmai_r2](../misc/includes/sskatmai_r2_md.md)] Express|If [!INCLUDE[sskatmai_r2](../misc/includes/sskatmai_r2_md.md)] Express is installed on the computers that are running [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1, you can open the project in all three versions.|  
|SQL Server Report Project|You can open the project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)]. For local mode only (that is, when not connected to SQL Server), you won’t get the design-time experience for controls that are associated with the viewer in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../misc/includes/vs2010_md.md)], but the project will function correctly at runtime. **Caution:**  If you add a feature that’s specific to [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], the report schema is upgraded automatically and you can no longer open the project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)].|  
|Unit tests|You can use [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../misc/includes/tcmext_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1 to open tests that were created in any of these versions.|  
|Visual C++|You can use [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] to open a C++ project that was created in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)] or Visual Studio 2010 SP1. If you want to use the [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] build environment to build a project that was created in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], you must have both versions of Visual Studio installed on the same computer. For more information, see [How to: Upgrade Visual C++ Projects to Visual Studio 2015](../Topic/How%20to:%20Upgrade%20Visual%20C++%20Projects%20to%20Visual%20Studio%202015.md) and [Visual C++ Porting and Upgrading Guide](../porting/visual-cpp-porting-and-upgrading-guide.md).|  
|Visual Studio 2010 web|If you allow Visual Studio to upgrade the project automatically, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1.|  
|Visual Studio 2010 Database (.dbproj)|If you convert the project to a SQL Server Data Tools Database project, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)]. However, [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] doesn’t support these artifacts:<br /><br /> -   unit tests<br />-   data-generation plans<br />-   data-comparison files<br />-   custom rule extensions for static code analysis<br />-   server.sqlsettings<br />-   .sqlcmd files<br />-   custom deployment extensions<br />-   partial projects (.files)<br /><br /> If you install SQL Server Data Tools, you can open the project in Visual Studio 2010 SP1 after the conversion. For more information, see [Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools](http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/tools.aspx).|  
|Visual Studio 2010 Visual Database Tools|You can open this project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1.|  
|Visual Studio Lab Management|You can use [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../misc/includes/tcmext_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1 to open environments that were created in any of these versions. However, the version of Microsoft Test Manager must match the version of Team Foundation Server before you can create environments.|  
|Visual Studio Macro|This project can't be opened in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] because it doesn't support the project type.|  
|Visual Studio SDK/VSIX|After you upgrade a Visual Studio SDK project to [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], it can't be opened in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Migrate Extensibility Projects to Visual Studio 2015](../Topic/How%20to:%20Migrate%20Extensibility%20Projects%20to%20Visual%20Studio%202015.md).|  
|Microsoft Azure Tools for Visual Studio|If you’re using Microsoft Azure Tools for Visual Studio version 2.1, you can open the project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1. For projects that target earlier versions, if you allow Visual Studio to upgrade the project to version 2.1, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1.|  
|Windows Communication Foundation, Windows Presentation Foundation|You can open this project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1.|  
|Windows Mobile|This project can't be opened in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] because it doesn't support the project type.|  
|Windows Phone 7.1|If you allow Visual Studio to upgrade the project to Windows Phone 8.0, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)].|  
|Other|You can open most other types of projects in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], and Visual Studio 2010 SP1.|  
|FrontPage Web Sites|This project can't be opened in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] because it doesn't support the project type.|  
|Portable Class Library|If you allow Visual Studio to update the project automatically, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)], or Visual Studio 2010 SP1.<br /><br /> -   Projects that targeted Silverlight 4 will target Silverlight 5.<br />-   Projects that targeted Windows Phone 7.0 or Windows Phone 7.5 will target Windows Phone 8.<br />-   Projects that targeted Xbox 360 will no longer target Xbox 360.|  
|Azure projects such as cloud service projects (.ccproj extension) and Azure Resource Manager projects (Cloud Deployment Projects) with the .deployproj extension|To open these types of projects, first install the [Azure SDK for .NET](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/), then open the project.|  
  
## Troubleshooting project compatibility issues  
 Here are some things you can do when a project won't open in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)]:  
  
-   If you try to open a project that isn't supported in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev14](../ide/includes/vs_dev14_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)] and for which the associated version of Visual Studio isn't installed, a message that the project type isn't supported might appear and the project type might be listed in the **Review Project and Solution Changes** dialog box under **Unsupported projects**. To resolve this issue, open the programs and features page in the Windows **Control Panel**, select **Visual Studio**, and then choose **Change**, **Repair**. Then you can install the missing version.  
  
-   If you try to open a project for a desktop app in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12_expwin](../misc/includes/vs_dev12_expwin_md.md)], an error occurs and one of these messages is displayed: "This edition of Visual Studio only supports [!INCLUDE[win81](../misc/includes/win81_md.md)] apps" or "This project is incompatible with the current edition of Visual Studio." [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12_expwin](../misc/includes/vs_dev12_expwin_md.md)] is restricted to the development, testing, and deployment of Windows Store apps designed for Windows 8.1. To open a desktop app project, you must use an edition of Visual Studio that supports that project type.  
  
     For more information about the Visual Studio editions, see [Microsoft Visual Studio Products](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=254332)  
  
-   If you try to open a Windows Store App project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12_expwin](../misc/includes/vs_dev12_expwin_md.md)] Desktop, an error occurs. [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12_expwin](../misc/includes/vs_dev12_expwin_md.md)] Desktop cannot be used to build Windows Store apps. If you want to build Windows Store apps, you can also install [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12_expwin](../misc/includes/vs_dev12_expwin_md.md)]. Or, to develop apps for all Microsoft platforms and the web, try Visual Studio Professional 2013.  
  
-   If a project requires features that are specific to [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], it can't be opened in an earlier version.  
  
-   If you're using [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../build/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)] and you want to open a project that was created in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)], you might be able to customize the project system to incorporate features of [!INCLUDE[vs_dev12](../atl-mfc-shared/includes/vs_dev12_md.md)]. For information about how to do this, see [Making Custom Projects Version-Aware](../misc/making-custom-projects-version-aware.md).
