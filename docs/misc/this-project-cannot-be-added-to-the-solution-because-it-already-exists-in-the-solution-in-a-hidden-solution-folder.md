# This project cannot be added to the solution because it already exists in the solution in a hidden Solution Folder.
A project can exist in a solution in only one location.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  To show hidden Solution Folders, select the solution or a Solution Folder that contains a hidden Solution Folder and then on the **Project** menu, select **Unhide Folders**.
