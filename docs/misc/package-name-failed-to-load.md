# Package &lt;name&gt; failed to load.
The package could not be opened. This error generally occurs when the package has not been registered correctly, the package is missing a DLL, the DLL is corrupted, or a DLL that the package requires from another component is missing.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Re-install the product that supplies the package.
