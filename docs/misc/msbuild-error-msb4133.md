# MSBuild Error MSB4133
**MSB4133: A default tools version "\<x.x.>" was specified, but its definition could not be found.**  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../build/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] cannot find the Toolset that is defined in the project file as the `DefaultToolsVersion`.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure that `DefaultToolsVersion` is specified correctly, and that this Toolset is defined either in the registry or in the [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../build/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] configuration file.
