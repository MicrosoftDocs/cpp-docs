# Floating-point migration issues  
  
Sometimes when you upgrade your projects to a newer version of Visual Studio, you may find that the results of certain floating-point operations have changed. This generally happens for one of two reasons: Code generation changes that take better advantage of the available processor, and bug fixes or changes to the algorithms used in math functions in the C runtime library (CRT). In general, the new results are correct to within the limits specified by the language standard. Read on to find out what's changed, and if it's important, how to get the same results your functions got before.  

## New math functions and Universal CRT changes  
  
Most CRT math functions have been available in Visual Studio for years, but starting in Visual Studio 2013, all of the functions required by ISO C99 are included. These functions are implemented to balance performance with correctness. Because producing the correctly rounded result in every case may be prohibitively expensive, these functions are designed to efficiently produce a close approximation to the correctly rounded result. In most cases, the result produced is within +/-1 unit of least precision, or *ulp*, of the correctly rounded result, though there may be cases where there is greater inaccuracy. If you were using a different math library to get these functions before, implementation differences may be responsible for the change in your results.   
    
When the math functions were moved to the Universal CRT in Visual Studio 2015, some new algorithms were used, and several bugs in the implementation of the functions that were new in Visual Studio 2013 were fixed. These changes can lead to detectable differences in the results of floating-point calculations that use these functions. The functions that had bug issues were erf, exp2, remainder, remquo, scalbln, and scalbn, and their float and long double variants.  Other changes in Visual Studio 2015 fixed issues in preserving floating point status word and exception state information in _clear87, _clearfp, fegetenv, fesetenv, and feholdexcept functions.  
  
## Processor differences and compiler flags  
  
Many of the floating point math library functions have different implementations for different CPU architectures. For example, the 32-bit x86 CRT may have a different implementation than the 64-bit x64 CRT. In addition, some of the functions may have multiple implementations for a given CPU architecture. The most efficient implementation is selected dynamically at run-time depending on the instruction sets supported by the CPU. For example, in the 32-bit x86 CRT, some functions have both an x87 implementation and an SSE2 implementation. When running on a CPU that supports SSE2, the faster SSE2 implementation is used. When running on a CPU that does not support SSE2, the slower x87 implementation is used. You may see this when migrating old code, because the default x86 compiler architecture option changed to [/arch:SSE2](../build/reference/arch-x86.md) in Visual Studio 2012. Because different implementations of the math library functions may use different CPU instructions and different algorithms to produce their results, the functions may produce different results on different platforms. In most cases, the results are within +/-1 ulp of the correctly rounded result, but the actual results may vary across CPUs.  
  
Code-generation correctness improvements in different floating point modes in Visual Studio can also affect the results of floating-point operations when old code is compared to new code, even when using the same compiler flags. For example, the code generated by Visual Studio 2010 when [/fp:precise](../build/reference/fp-specify-floating-point-behavior.md) (the default) or `/fp:strict` was specified may not have propagated intermediate not-a-number (NaN) values through expressions correctly. Thus, some expressions that gave a numeric result in older compilers may now correctly produce a NaN result. You may also see differences because the code optimizations enabled for `/fp:fast` now take advantage of more processor features. These optimizations can use fewer instructions, but may impact the generated results because some previously visible intermediate operations have been removed.  
  
## How to get identical results  
  
In most cases, the floating-point changes in the newest compilers and libraries result in faster or more correct behavior, or both. You may even see better processor power performance when SSE2 instructions replace x87 instructions. However, if you have code that must precisely replicate the floating point behavior of an older compiler, consider using Visual Studio native multi-targeting capabilities, and build the affected project with the older toolset. For more information, see [Use native multi-targeting in Visual Studio to build old projects](use-native-multi-targeting.md).
