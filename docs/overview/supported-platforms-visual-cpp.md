# Supported platforms (Visual C++)

Apps built by using Visual Studio can be targeted to various platforms.

## Visual Studio target OS and architecture support

<sup>a</sup> ARM64 support is available in Visual Studio 2017 and later.

<sup>b</sup> You can use the Windows XP platform toolsets included in Visual Studio 2017, Visual Studio 2015, Visual Studio 2013, and Visual Studio 2012 Update 1 to build Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 projects. For information on how to use these platform toolsets, see [Configuring Programs for Windows XP](../build/configuring-programs-for-windows-xp.md). For more information on changing the platform toolset, see [How to: Modify the Target Framework and Platform Toolset](../build/how-to-modify-the-target-framework-and-platform-toolset.md).

<sup>c</sup> You can install the **Mobile development with C++** workload in the installer for Visual Studio 2017 and later. In Visual Studio 2015 setup, choose the optional **Visual C++ for Cross Platform Mobile Development** component to target iOS or Android platforms. For instructions, see [Install Visual C++ for Cross-Platform Mobile Development](/visualstudio/cross-platform/install-visual-cpp-for-cross-platform-mobile-development). To build iOS code, you must have a Mac computer and meet other requirements. For a list of prerequisites and installation instructions, see [Install And Configure Tools to Build using iOS](/visualstudio/cross-platform/install-and-configure-tools-to-build-using-ios). You can build x86 or ARM code to match the target hardware. Use x86 configurations to build for some Android devices. Use ARM configurations to build for iOS devices and most Android devices.

<sup>d</sup> You can install the **Linux development with C++** workload in the installer for Visual Studio 2017 and later to target Linux platforms. For instructions, see [Download, install, and setup the Linux Workload](../linux/download-install-and-setup-the-linux-development-workload.md). This toolset compiles your executable on the target machine, so you can build for any supported architecture.

For information about how to set the target platform configuration, see [How to: Configure Visual C++ projects to target 64-bit, x64 platforms](../build/how-to-configure-visual-cpp-projects-to-target-64-bit-platforms.md).
