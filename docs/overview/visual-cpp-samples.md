# Visual Studio C++ samples

Samples for Visual Studio C++ are available on the web. Microsoft has produced many C++ samples that demonstrate different functionalities across multiple technologies. Here are a few of the places to find additional samples:

- [C++ code samples](/samples/browse/?term=c%2B%2B)

- [Windows samples on GitHub](https://microsoft.github.io/windows/)

- [Windows Dev Center code samples](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/samples)

- [ADO code samples](/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/ado-code-examples-in-microsoft-visual-c)

- [Windows Hardware development samples](/samples/browse/?products=windows-wdk)

## Archived C++ samples on GitHub

Previous versions of Visual Studio included C++ sample code. The sample code was either installed with Visual Studio, or was available as a separate download. Many articles in our documentation refer to these samples. They don't get installed by Visual Studio anymore. Instead, a repository is available on GitHub. The following tables have descriptions for each sample, and links to the sample's directory in the repository.

| [Lock screen apps sample (Windows 8)](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2012Samples/Windows%208%20samples/C%2B%2B/Windows%208%20app%20samples) | This sample shows how an app can have a presence on the lock screen—the screen that is shown when the computer is locked—with a badge to provide basic status information or a tile to provide more detailed status. |
| [XAML text display sample (Windows 8)](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2012Samples/Windows%208%20samples/C%2B%2B/Windows%208%20app%20samples) | This sample demonstrates how control the appearance of text in your app. |
| [SimpleOrientationSensor sample (Windows 8)](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2012Samples/Windows%208%20samples/C%2B%2B/Windows%208%20app%20samples) | This sample shows how to use the `Windows.Devices.Sensors.SimpleOrientationSensor` API. |
| [Direct3D sprite sample (Windows 8)](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2012Samples/Windows%208%20samples/C%2B%2B/Windows%208%20app%20samples) | This sample provides a Direct3D implementation of sprite batch behaviors, similar to the XNA `SpriteBatch` API. Sprites are 2-D bitmaps that can be transformed and managed independently in a 3-D scene, typically used in 2-D games. |
| [Direct3D stereoscopic 3D sample (Windows 8)](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2012Samples/Windows%208%20samples/C%2B%2B/Windows%208%20app%20samples) | This sample demonstrates how to add a stereoscopic 3-D effect to C++ apps by using Direct3D. It also demonstrates how to respond to system stereo changes in Direct3D. The stereoscopic 3-D effect requires a display that supports stereo 3-D. |
| [Creating a Windows Runtime DLL component with C++ sample  (Windows 8)](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2012Samples/Windows%208%20samples/C%2B%2B/Windows%208%20app%20samples) | This sample shows how to create an in-process DLL component in Microsoft Visual C++. It's used in C++/CX, JavaScript, and C# client code. The OvenServer project contains a runtime class named `Oven`, which implements an `IOven` interface. |
| [Creating a Windows Runtime EXE component with C++ sample  (Windows 8)](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2012Samples/Windows%208%20samples/C%2B%2B/Windows%208%20app%20samples) | This sample shows how to create an out-of-process EXE component in Microsoft Visual C++. It's used in C++/CX, JavaScript, and C# client code. The OvenServer project contains a runtime class named `Oven`, which implements an `IOven` interface. |
