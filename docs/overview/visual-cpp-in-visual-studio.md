Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) refers to the C++, C, and assembly language development tools and libraries available as part of Visual Studio on Windows. These tools and libraries let you create native Windows desktop and server applications, Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, or managed apps and libraries that use the .NET Framework. Create cross-platform libraries and apps that run on Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS. You can use MSVC to write anything from simple console apps to the most sophisticated and complex apps for Windows desktop. Write device drivers and operating system components or cross-platform games for mobile devices. Target anything from the smallest IoT devices to multi-server high performance computing in the Azure cloud.

Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 can be installed side-by-side. You can use Visual Studio 2019 (compiler toolset v142) or Visual Studio 2017 (v141) to edit and build programs using the toolset from Visual Studio 2017 (v141) and Visual Studio 2015 (v140).
