| C++ language conformance improvements | [C++ Conformance improvements, behavior changes, and bug fixes in Visual Studio 2022 17.13](cpp-conformance-improvements.md#improvements_1713) |

A quick highlight of some new features:

- **C++ language enhancements**

  - Try out C++23 preview features by setting the C++ Language Standard to `/std:c++23preview`. This setting enables the latest C++23 features and bug fixes. For more information, see [/std (Specify Language Standard Version)](../build/reference/std-specify-language-standard-version.md#stdc23preview).
  - Support for C++23â€™s `size_t` literal suffix, which helps avoid truncations or signed comparison mismatches--especially when writing loops. For example:
    ```cpp
    // Infinite loop if v.size > max unsigned int 
    for (auto i = 0u; i < v.size(); ++i)
    { 
      ...
    } 
    
    // Fixed because of uz literal 
    for (auto i = 0uz; i < v.size(); ++i)
    { 
      ...
    } 
    ```

  - Support for vector lengths for code generation on x86 and x64. For more information, see [/vlen](../build/reference/vlen.md).
  - Support for Intel Advanced Vector Extensions 10 version 1. For more information about `/arch:AVX10.1`, see [/arch (x64)](../build/reference/arch-x64.md).

- **Standard Library enhancements**

  - Standard library support for coroutines. In this example from [P2502R2](https://wg21.link/p2502r2), the `fib` function is a coroutine. When the `co_yield` statement is executed, `fib` is suspended and the value is returned to the caller. You can resume the `fib` coroutine later to produce more values without requiring any manual state handling:

    ```cpp
    std::generator<int> fib()
    { 
      auto a = 0, b = 1; 
   
      while (true)
      { 
          co_yield std::exchange(a, std::exchange(b, a + b)); 
      }
    } 
      
    int answer_to_the_universe()
    { 
      auto rng = fib() | std::views::drop(6) | std::views::take(3); 
      return std::ranges::fold_left(std::move(rng), 0, std::plus{}); 
    } 
    ```

 - Moved `system_clock`, `high_resolution_clock`, and `chrono_literals` from a commonly included internal header to `<chrono>`. If you see compiler errors that types like `system_clock` or user-defined literals like `1729ms` aren't recognized, include `<chrono>`.
  - Improved the vectorized implementations of `bitset` constructors from strings, `basic_string::find_last_of()`, `remove()`, `ranges::remove`, and the `minmax_element()` and `minmax()` algorithm families.
  - Added vectorized implementations of:
    - `find_end()` and `ranges::find_end` for 1-byte and 2-byte elements.
    - `basic_string::find()` and `basic_string::rfind()` for a substring.
    - `basic_string::rfind()` for a single character.
  - Merged C++23 Defect Reports:
    - [P3107R5](https://wg21.link/P3107R5) Permit an efficient implementation of `<print>`.
    - [P3235R3](https://wg21.link/P3235R3) `std::print` More types faster with less memory.

- **GitHub Copilot**

  - GitHub Copilot Free is now available. Get 2,000 code completions and 50 chat requests per month at no cost.
  - GitHub Copilot code completions provide autocomplete suggestions inline as you code. To enhance the experience of C++ developers, GitHub Copilot includes other relevant files as context. This reduces errors while offering more relevant and accurate suggestions.
  - You can now request a code review from GitHub Copilot from the Git Changes window:
    :::image type="complex" source="./media/vs2022-copilot-git-changes-review.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Git Changes window with the GitHub Copilot Review button highlighted.":::
    The Git Changes window is open with the GitHub Copilot Review button highlighted.
    :::image-end:::

    GitHub Copilot looks for potential issues and creates comments for them:

    :::image type="complex" source="./media/vs2022-copilot-comment-example.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the GitHub Copilot explaining an issue.":::
    GitHub Copilot found an issue with the line if ( is_enabled_) new_site.disable(). It says it may be a mistake and should likely be if ( is_enabled_) new_site.enable() because the intention seem to be enabling the new site if the breakpoint is enabled.
    :::image-end:::

    To use this feature, ensure the following are turned on:
      - **Tools** > **Options** >â€¯**Preview Features**â€¯>â€¯**Pull Request Comments**
      - **Tools**â€¯> **Options**â€¯>â€¯**GitHub**â€¯>â€¯**Copilot**â€¯>â€¯**Source Control Integration**â€¯>â€¯**Enable Git preview features**.

  - GitHub Copilot Edits is a new feature that can make changes across multiple files in your project. To start a new Edits session, click **Create new edit session** at the top of the GitHub Copilot Chat window:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/vs2022-copilot-edit-session.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the GitHub Copilot Chat window. The Create new edit session button is highlighted.":::

    Describe the changes you want to make and Copilot suggests relevant edits. You can preview the edits one-by-one and accept the ones you want or make corrections:

    :::image type="complex" source="./media/vs2022-copilot-edit-session-example.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the GitHub Copilot Chat window displaying the files it edited.":::
    GitHub Copilot is displaying a summary of the changes it made, such as 1. Create a new subclass range_breakpoint in include/libsdb/breakpoint.hpp" and 2. Implement the range_breakpoint class in src/breakpoint.cpp. An option to accept the changes is displayed.
    :::image-end:::

    For more information, see [Iterate across multiple files more efficiently with GitHub Copilot Edits](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/iterate-across-multiple-files-more-efficiently-with-github-copilot-edits-preview/).

- **CMake**
  - Now supports CMake Presets v9. New macro expansions in a preset's include field. For more information, see [Macro expansion](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html#macro-expansion) in the official CMake documentation.

A quick highlight of some of the new features:

- **Standard Library Enhancements**
  - C++23 Formatting ranges ([P2286R8](https://wg21.link/P2286R8)) implementation complete. Added formattersâ€¯for the container adaptorsâ€¯`stack`,â€¯`queue`, andâ€¯`priority_queue`.
  - Added multidimensional subscript operators, which also support `<mdspan>`. For example: `print("m[{}, {}]: '{}'; ", i, j, m[i, j])`.
- **Game development in C++**
  - Directly open Unreal Engine projects in Visual Studio without having to generate a Visual Studio solution file wrapping the Unreal Engine project. For more information, see [Work with Unreal Engine projects in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/gamedev/unreal/get-started/vs-tools-unreal-quickstart).
  - You can specify the command line arguments to pass when debugging directly from the toolbar. For more information, see [Set command line arguments for Unreal Engine projects](/visualstudio/gamedev/unreal/get-started/vs-tools-unreal-quickstart#set-command-line-arguments).
  :::image type="content" source="./media/command-line-argument-dropdown.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the command-line argument dropdown. It contains one command line argument: -graphicsadaptor=0.":::
- **Build Insights**
  - You can run Build Insights on selected files. Select the files you want in the **Solution Explorer**, right-click, and choose **Run Build Insights on Selected Files**:
  :::image type="content" source="./media/build-insights-run-on-selected-files.png" alt-text="A screenshot of files in the Solution Explorer. The context menu is open and the option to Run Build Insights on Selected Files is highlighted.":::
  - You can filter Build Insights results by project. Click the filter button on the filter column header and select the projects you want to see results for:
  :::image type="content" source="./media/build-insights-filter-by-project.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Build Insights window with the Included Files tab open. The filter button was selected and a list of projects appears. Checkboxes next to Two projects are checked.":::
  - Clicking the question mark icon in the Build Insights window to see a short description for the tabs in the Build Insights window, and a link to the documentation for a detailed explanation:
  :::image type="content" source="./media/build-insights-view-explanations.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Build Insights window with the view explanations button (a question mark in a circle) highlighted.":::
- **GitHub Copilot**
  - You can click **Ask Copilot** next to the value of a variable to get AI-driven insights into what led to its current state. For example, the following program has an off-by-one error in its loop condition:
  :::image type="complex" source="./media/copilot-smart-variable-inspection.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Autos window. The variable named it is NULL. The Ask Copilot icon next to it is highlighted.":::
  The code that caused this problem is: for (auto it = h.animals_.begin(); it <= h.animals_.end(); it++).
  :::image-end:::
  If you click Ask Copilot icon for the `it` variable, it tells you why it is `<NULL>`:
  :::image type="complex" source="./media/copilot-smart-variable-explanation.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a GitHub Copilot window.":::
  This error is inside a function defined as int calculate_number_of_cats(const house& h). The GitHub Copilot message says: "The value of the expression it is NULL, which means that the iterator is not pointing to any valid element in the vector animals_. In the context of your program, it is supposed to iterate over the animals_ vector in the house object to count the number of cat objects. Why it is null. Based on the locals and call stack context: the house object h has an empty animals_ vector (size=0). The loop condition it <= h.animals_.end() is incorrect. It should be it != h.animals_.end()."
  :::image-end:::
  - You can click **Ask Copilot** about errors in the Visual Studio **Error List** to get help on the error and a suggested fix. For example:
  :::image type="complex" source="./media/copilot-fix-my-code.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Error List window.":::
  The Ask Copilot icon is highlighted next to an error that unique_ptr is attempting to reference a deleted function.
  :::image-end:::
  If you click Ask Copilot, it tells you about the error:
  :::image type="complex" source="./media/copilot-fix-my-code-suggestion.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the GitHub Copilot explanation for the error.":::
  The Copilot message says: "The error occurs because the range-based for loop was attempting to copy std::unique_ptr objects, which is not allowed since std::unique_ptr cannot be copied. To fix this, I changed the loop to use a reference to avoid copying the std::unique_ptr objects. This way, the loop iterates over references to the std::unique_ptr objects, which is allowed."
  :::image-end:::
- **Debugging**
  - New debug visualizers for `mutex`, `recursive_mutex`, and `move_iterator`.
  - The debugger now displays return values inline:
  :::image type="content" source="./media/debugger-inline-return-values.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a tooltip showing the value 8.25. It's the result of the expression following the return statement that was stepped over.":::

A partial list of new features:

- **Standard Library Enhancements**
    - The formatted output implementation now includes `std::range_formatter` and formatters for `std::pair` and `std::tuple`.
    - Added support for `std::println()` with no arguments. This prints a blank line as proposed in [P3142R0](https://wg21.link/P3142R0).
    - Improved vectorization for several algorithms including `replace_copy()`,â€¯`replace_copy_if()`,â€¯`ranges::replace_copy`, `ranges::replace_copy_if`, `find_first_of()`â€¯andâ€¯`ranges::find_first_of`,â€¯for 8-bit and 16-bit elements, `mismatch()`, `ranges::mismatch`, `count()`, `ranges::count`, `find()`, `ranges::find`, `ranges::find_last`, and `ranges::iota`.

- **Game development in C++**
    - You can now add common Unreal Engine class templates, modules, and plugins from within Visual Studio. For more information, see [Add Unreal Engine classes, modules, and plugins in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/gamedev/unreal/get-started/vs-tools-unreal-add-class-module-plugin).
    - The new Unreal Engine toolbar provides quick access to Unreal Engine related actions from within Visual Studio. The toolbar allows you to quickly attach to Unreal Engine processes, rescan the Blueprints cache, quickly access the Unreal Engine Log, and provides quick access to the Unreal Engine Configuration Page for Visual Studio. For more information, see [Unreal Engine Toolbar](/visualstudio/gamedev/unreal/get-started/vs-tools-unreal-quickstart#unreal-engine-toolbar).
    - You can now filter trace results by project. Also, results in each row show the relative path and file name instead of the full path. Results grouping in the **Included Files** view is also improved:
    :::image type="complex" source="./media/include-diagnostics-improved.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the improved Included Files diagnostics results.":::
    The Included Files view has a new column for the project. The Project column is selected and projects such as (Select All), CompilerIdC, OpenAL, common, and so on, are selected. The included files are listed by relative path and file name and grouped together.
    :::image-end:::
- **CMake debugging**
    - You can now debug your CMake scripts andâ€¯`CMakeLists.txt`â€¯files in the Visual Studio debugger for CMake projects that target Linux via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or SSH. To start a CMake debugging session in Visual Studio, set a breakpoint in yourâ€¯`CMakeLists.txt`â€¯file and then navigate toâ€¯**Project** > **Configure Cache with CMake Debugging**.
- **GitHub Copilot**
    - When you hover over symbols in the code editor, click the Copilot **Tell me more** button in the Quick Info dialog to learn more about a given symbol:
    :::image type="complex" source="./media/github-copilot-quick-info.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Quick Info window.":::
    The Quick Info window is shown above a function. The Tell me more link is highlighted.
    :::image-end:::
    - GitHub Copilot can generate naming suggestions for your identifiers (variables, methods, or classes) based on how your identifier is used and the style of your code.
      :::image type="complex" source="./media/copilot-rename.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the GitHub Copilot Rename dialog.":::
      The Rename dialog has a New name field with a dropdown list that shows these choices: text_color, font_color, display_color, console_color, and menu_text_color.
      :::image-end:::
    You need an activeâ€¯[GitHub Copilot subscription](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/github-copilot/). Right-click the variable you wish to rename, and choose **Rename** (`Ctrl+R`,â€¯`Ctrl+R`). Select the GitHub Copilot sparkle icon to generate naming suggestions.

- **Debugging**
    - Conditional breakpoints in C++ are faster.

- **Diagnostics improvements**
    - Improved diagnostics when calling `std::get<T>` on a `std::tuple` that has multiple instances of `T` in its template arguments. MSVC used to report:\
          `error C2338: static_assert failed: 'duplicate type T in get<T>(tuple)'`.\
      Now it reports:\
          `error C2338: static_assert failed: 'get<T>(tuple<Types...>&) requires T to occur exactly once in Types.(N4971 [tuple.elemm]/5)'`
    - Improved diagnostics when `std::ranges::to` is unable to construct the requested result. MSVC used to report:\
          `error C2338: static_assert failed: 'the program is ill-formed per N4950 [range.utility.conv.to]/2.3'`\
      Now it reports:\
             `error C2338: static_assert failed: 'ranges::to requires the result to be constructible from the source range, either by using a suitable constructor, or by inserting each element of the range into the default-constructed object. (N4981 [range.utility.conv.to]/2.1.5)'`

    Above the # include is a **reference** link and many of the references to this # include file (in this case 1). The build time is also listed (in this case less than 1/2 a second).
    :::image-end:::
- Memory layout visualization, which shows how memory is arranged for your classes, structs, and unions. Hover over a type and choose the **Memory Layout** link in the **Quick Info** to open a dedicated window displaying the memory layout of the selected type. Hovering over individual data types within this window provides detailed information about their size and offset within the type.
    :::image type="complex" source="media/memory-layout-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the memory layout window":::
    The memory layout window shows the contents of the Snake class. It shows the memory offsets of the various fields of the class such as Point classes for the location of the head and body, the score, and so on.
    :::image-end:::
- You can now specify your own custom CMake executable. This feature is useful if you want to use a specific version of CMake that isn't shipped with Visual Studio. Navigate to **Tools** > **Options** and select **CMake** > **General**. Select **Enable custom CMake executable** and specify the directory path of your CMake executable.
    :::image type="complex" source="media/custom-cmake-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the CMake options dialog":::

| New features in the Visual Studio 17.5 IDE | [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5 Release Notes](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-v17.5) |

A partial list of new features includes:

- `std::move`, `std::forward`, `std::move_if_noexcept`, and `std::forward_like` now don't produce function calls in generated code, even in debug mode. This change avoids named casts causing unnecessary overhead in debug builds. `/permissive-` (or an option that implies it, such as `/std:c++20` or `/std:c++latest`) is required.
- Added [`[[msvc::intrinsic]]`](../cpp/attributes.md#msvcintrinsic). You can apply this attribute to nonrecursive functions consisting of a single cast, which take only one parameter.
- Added support for Linux Console in the Integrated Terminal, which allows for terminal I/O.
- Added initial experimental support for C11 atomic primitives (`<stdatomic.h>`). You can enable this experimental feature with the `/experimental:c11atomics` option in `/std:c11` mode or later.
- Added a new set of experimental high-confidence checks to the Lifetime Checker for reduced noise.
- A new preview feature, Remote File Explorer, lets you view the file directory on your remote machines within VS, and upload and download files to it.
- Changed versioning of CMake executables shipped with Visual Studio to match Kitware versions.
- Added support for Hot Reload to the CMake Project template.
- Go To Definition for C++ now uses a more subtle indicator of the operation taking more time, replacing the modal dialog from previous versions.
- Started rollout of an experiment providing more smart results in the C++ autocompletion and member list. This functionality was previously known as Predictive IntelliSense but now uses a new presentation method.
- We now ship a native Arm64 Clang toolset with our LLVM workload, allowing native compilation on Arm64 machines.
- Added localization to the [Image Watch Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualCPPTeam.ImageWatchForVisualStudio2022) (This extension is available in the Marketplace, and isn't bundled through the Visual Studio Installer).
- Added support for opening a Terminal window into the currently running Developer Container.
- Made several improvements to IntelliSense macro expansion. Notably, we enabled recursive expansion in more contexts, and we added options to the pop up to copy the expansion to the clipboard or expand the macro inline.
- Concurrent monitoring is now supported in the Serial Monitor. Concurrent monitoring allows you to monitor multiple ports at the same time side by side. Press the plus button to open another Serial Monitor and get started.
- You can now view properties from base classes modified in an Unreal Blueprint asset without leaving Visual Studio. Double-click in a Blueprint reference for a C++ class or property to open the UE Asset Inspector in Visual Studio.
- Enabled running DevContainers on a remote Linux machine.
- Enabled selection of multiple targets to build in the CMake Targets view.
- Added support for CMakePresets.json version 5. See the [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.24/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) for information of new features.
- Enabled Test Explorer to build and test multiple CMake targets in parallel.
- Added "Open container in terminal" option to Dev Containers.
- Implemented standard library features:

  - [P2508R1](https://wg21.link/P2508R1) `basic_format_string`, `format_string`, `wformat_string`
  - [P2322R6](https://wg21.link/P2322R6) `ranges::fold_left`, `ranges::fold_right`, and so on.
  - [P2321R2](https://wg21.link/P2321R2) `views::zip` (doesn't include `zip_transform`, `adjacent`, and `adjacent_transform`)

## What's new for C++ in Visual Studio version 17.4

*Released Nov 2022*

|---|---|
| What's new for C++ developers | [What's New for C++ Developers in Visual Studio 2022 17.4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/whats-new-for-cpp-developers-in-visual-studio-2022-17-4/) |
| Standard Library (STL) merged C++23 features, Language Working Group (LWG) issue resolutions, performance improvements, enhanced behavior, and fixed bugs | [STL Changelog 17.4](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/VS-2022-Changelog#vs-2022-174) |
| New features in the Visual Studio 17.4 IDE | [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.4 Release Notes](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-v17.4) |
| C++ language conformance improvements in Visual Studio 2022 17.4 | [C++ Conformance improvements, behavior changes, and bug fixes in Visual Studio 2022](cpp-conformance-improvements.md#improvements_174) |

A partial list of new features in 17.4:

- Improved compiler error messages to provide more correct and useful information, especially for concepts.
- Added experimental MSVC option [`/experimental:log<directory>`](../build/reference/experimental-log.md) to output [structured SARIF diagnostics](../build/reference/sarif-output.md) to the specified directory.
- Added support for C23 attributes to IntelliSense and continued progress in C++20 modules support.
- Improved indexing performance when opening a new solution. Large projects could see a 20-35% improvement from 17.3.
- Improved Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO):
  - NRVO is enabled for cases that involve exception handling or loops.
  - NRVO is enabled even under **`/Od`** if the user passes the **`/Zc:nrvo`** option, or **`/std:c++20`** or later, or **`/permissive-`**.
  - You can now disable NRVO with the **`/Zc:nrvo-`** option.
- Upgraded the version of LLVM shipped with Visual Studio to 15.0.1. For more information on what is available, see the [LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/15.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) and [Clang](https://releases.llvm.org/15.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) release notes.
- Added support to Visual Studio for vcpkg artifacts with CMake projects. For projects that include a vcpkg manifest, the environment is activated automatically on project open. Learn more about this feature in the [vcpkg environment activation in Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/vsvcpkgenv) blog post.
- You can now use Dev Containers for your C++ projects. Learn more about this feature in our [Dev Containers for C++](https://aka.ms/vscppdevcontainer) blog post.
- IntelliSense now respects the order of preincluded headers when one of them is a PCH. Previously, when a PCH was used via **`/Yu`** and force-included via **`/FI`**, IntelliSense would always process it first, before any other headers included via **`/FI`**. This behavior didn't match the build behavior. With this change, **`/FI`** headers are processed in the order they're specified.
- Removed internal prefixes from CTest names in Test Explorer.
- Updated the version of CMake shipped with Visual Studio to version 3.24.1. For details of what is available, see the [CMake release notes](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.24/release/3.24.html).
- Android SDK update:
  - Ant scripts were removed, so users no longer see Ant-based templates in the New Project dialog. For help migrating from Ant templates to Gradle templates, see [Migrating Builds From Apache Ant](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/migrating_from_ant.html)
  - Added support for building with NDK 23 and 24
  - Updated NDK component to the LTS version 23
- Added vectorized implementations of `ranges::min_element()`, `ranges::max_element()`, and `ranges::minmax_element()`
- We continue to track the latest developments in C++ standardization. Support for these C++23 features is available by including [`/std:c++latest`](../build/reference/std-specify-language-standard-version.md) in your compiler options:
  - [P2302R4](https://wg21.link/p2302r4) `ranges::contains`, `ranges::contains_subrange`
  - [P2499R0](https://wg21.link/p2499r0) `string_view` Range Constructor Should Be `explicit`
  - [P0849R8](https://wg21.link/p0849r8) `auto(x)`: decay-copy In The Language

    (The compiler part isn't implemented yet. The library part was implemented in C++20 mode when Ranges support was initially implemented.)
  - [P0881R7](https://wg21.link/p0881r7) `<stacktrace>`
  - [P2301R1](https://wg21.link/p2301r1) Add a `pmr` alias for `std::stacktrace`
  - [P1328R1](https://wg21.link/p1328r1) `constexpr type_info::operator==()`
  - [P2440R1](https://wg21.link/p2440r1) `ranges::iota`, `ranges::shift_left`, `ranges::shift_right`
  - [P2441R2](https://wg21.link/p2441r2) `views::join_with`

- Added an option "Navigation after Create Declaration/Definition" to allow you to choose the navigation behavior of the Create Declaration/Definition feature. You can select between peeking (the default) or opening the document, or no navigation.
- Arm64 builds of Visual Studio now bundle Arm64 versions of CMake and Ninja.
- Added support for CMake Presets version 4. For details of what is available, see the [CMake release notes](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.23/release/3.23.html#id6).
- Remote system connections using the [Connection Manager](../linux/connect-to-your-remote-linux-computer.md) now support SSH ProxyJump. ProxyJump is used to access an SSH host via another SSH host (for example, to access a host behind a firewall).

## What's new for C++ in Visual Studio version 17.3

*Released Aug 2022*

| What's new for C++ developers | [C++ improvements in 17.3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-17-3-is-now-available/#c++-improvements) |
| Standard Library (STL) merged C++23 features, Language Working Group (LWG) issue resolutions, performance improvements, enhanced behavior, and fixed bugs | [STL Changelog 17.3](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/VS-2022-Changelog#vs-2022-173) |
| New features in the Visual Studio 17.3 IDE | [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3 Release Notes](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-v17.3) |
| C++ language conformance improvements in Visual Studio 2022 17.3 | [C++ Conformance improvements, behavior changes, and bug fixes in Visual Studio 2022](cpp-conformance-improvements.md#improvements_173) |

A partial list of new features in 17.3:

- The Arm64EC toolchain is no longer marked as experimental and is ready for production use.
- The Visual Studio Terminal can now be used as an SSH client with your stored SSH connections. With the C++ for Linux Tools installed, open the Terminal tool window. The Terminal dropdown is populated with your stored connections. When you select a connection, a new Terminal window opens inside Visual Studio that shows a pseudo-terminal on your remote system. Control characters, colors, and cursor positional awareness are all supported.
- Visual Studio can now add Unreal Engine class templates for your UE projects. To try this feature, ensure **IDE support for Unreal Engine** is selected in the **Game development with C++** workload in the Visual Studio Installer. When you're working on a UE project, right-click in the project or a folder/filter and select **Add** > **UE Class**.
- **Go to Definition** now remembers the prior signature and navigates accordingly when a better match isn't available (for example, after you manually change the signature of one of the pair).
The responsiveness of **Go To All** is improved. Previously, results appeared after you stopped typing. In the new experience, results show as you type.
- In contexts requiring `enum` type completion (for example, assignments to `enum` variables, case labels, returning `enum` type, and so on), the autocompletion list is now filtered to just the matching enumerators and related constructs.
- Added NuGet PackageReference support for C++/CLI MSBuild projects targeting .NET Core. This change was made to unblock mixed codebases from being able to adopt .NET Core. This support doesn't work for other C++ project types or any C++ project types targeting .NET Framework. There are no plans to extend PackageReference support to other C++ scenarios. The team is working on separate experiences involving vcpkg for non-MSBuild scenarios and to add greater functionality.
- Added a Serial Monitor window for embedded development, available through **Debug** > **Windows** > **Serial Monitor**.
- Improved C++ indexing by ~66% compared to 17.2.
- Updated the version of CMake shipped with Visual Studio to version 3.23. See the [CMake 3.23 release notes](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.23/release/3.23.html) for details of what is available.
- Upgraded the versions of LLVM tools shipped with Visual Studio to v14. For details of what is available, see the [LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/14.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) and [Clang](https://releases.llvm.org/14.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) release notes.
- Updated the side-by-side Dev 16.11 C++ Toolset to version 14.29.30145.00. The latest version of the Dev 16.11 C++ Toolset contains important bug fixes, including fixing all remaining C++20 defect reports. For more information about bug fixes, including C++20 defect reports in Dev 16.11, see [Visual Studio 2019 version 16.11.14 release notes](/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#16.11.14).
- Made various improvements to the in-editor experience of C++ modules. We're continuously working on improving the quality of the experience but encourage you to try them in 17.3. Report remaining issues through [Developer Community](https://aka.ms/vsfeedback/browsecpp).

- Added experimental support for C++20 modules in CMake projects. This support is currently only available with the Visual Studio (MSBuild) generator.
- In 17.1, we introduced peripheral register and RTOS views for embedded developers. We continue to improve the capabilities of those views with usability improvements in 17.2:
  - The RTOS tool window is now hidden by default. It prevents showing a tool window with error messages that aren't relevant when you're not using an RTOS.
  - When you double-click an RTOS object in the tool window, it adds a watch for the object.
  - When you select the start and end values for the stack pointer in the RTOS tool window, it opens in the memory window.
  - Added thread awareness for device targets to the call stack window.
  - Users can now select a pin icon next to peripherals, registers, or fields to pin them to the top of the Peripheral View.
- Added implementations of the remaining C++20 defect reports (also known as *backports*). All C++20 features are now available under the **`/std:c++20`** option. For more information about the implemented backports, see the [VS 2022 Changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/VS-2022-Changelog#vs-2022-172) in the Microsoft/STL GitHub repository and the [MSVC's STL Completes `/std:c++20`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/msvcs-stl-completes-stdc20/) blog post.
- We added various C++23 Library features, available under the **`/std:c++latest`** option. For more information about the new features, see the [STL Repo changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Changelog).
- Improved performance of the initial C++ indexing by up to 20%, depending on the depth of the include graph.

A partial list of new features in 17.1:

- A new **Configure Preset** template is added to configure and build CMake projects on a remote macOS system with *`CMakePresets.json`*. You can also launch CMake targets on a remote macOS system, and then debug remotely in the Visual Studio debugger backed by GDB or LLDB.
- You can now debug core dumps on a remote macOS system from Visual Studio with LLDB or GDB.
- The versions of [`Clang`](https://releases.llvm.org/13.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) and [`LLVM`](https://releases.llvm.org/13.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) shipped with Visual Studio are upgraded to v13.
- Visual Studio's CMake integration is only active when a *`CMakeLists.txt`* is identified at the root of the open workspace. If a *`CMakeLists.txt`* is identified at another level of the workspace, then you're prompted to activate Visual Studio's CMake integration with a notification.
- New views that enable you to inspect and interact with peripheral registers on microcontrollers and real time operating systems (RTOS) objects, available through **Debug** > **Windows** > **Embedded Registers**
- Added a new thread view for RTOS projects, available through **Debug** > **Windows** > **RTOS Objects**. For more information, see [Embedded Software Development in Visual Studio](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/visual-studio-embedded-development/).

## What's new for C++ in Visual Studio version 17.0

*Released Nov 2021*

|---|---|
| New features in the Visual Studio 17.0 IDE | [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0 Release Notes](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-v17.0) |
| Standard Library (STL) merged C++23 and C++26 features, C++20 defect reports, Language Working Group (LWG) issue resolutions, performance improvements, enhanced behavior, and fixed bugs | [STL Changelog 17.0](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/VS-2022-Changelog#vs-2022-170) |

An overview of some of the new features in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0:

- The Visual Studio IDE, *`devenv.exe`*, is now a native 64-bit application.
- The MSVC toolset now defaults to SHA-256 source hashing in debug records. Previously, the toolset used MD5 for source hashing by default.
- The v143 build tools are now available through the Visual Studio installer and in the [standalone build tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/pre/vs_BuildTools.exe).

### Hot Reload for native C++

- [Hot Reload for C++](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/edit-your-c-code-while-debugging-with-hot-reload-in-visual-studio-2022/) makes it possible to make many types of code edits to your running app and apply them without needing to pause app execution with something like a breakpoint.

In Visual Studio 2022, when you start your app in the debugger, you can use the Hot Reload button to modify your application while it's still running. This experience is powered by native Edit and Continue. For more information about supported edits, see [Edit and Continue (C++)](/visualstudio/debugger/edit-and-continue-visual-cpp?view=vs-2022&preserve-view=true).

- Hot Reload supports CMake and Open Folder projects.

### WSL2 support

- You can now build and debug natively on WSL2 without establishing an SSH connection. Both cross-platform CMake projects and MSBuild-based Linux projects are supported.

### Improved CMake support

- Upgraded the version of CMake shipped with Visual Studio to version 3.21. For more information on what's available in this version, see the [CMake 3.21 release notes](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.21.html).

- CMake Overview Pages are updated to support *`CMakePresets.json`*.
- You can now configure and build your CMake projects with CMake 3.21 and *`CMakePresets.json`* v3.
- Visual Studio now supports the `buildPresets.targets` option in *`CMakePresets.json`*. This option allows you to build a subset of targets in your CMake project.
- The Project menu in CMake projects is streamlined and exposes options to "Delete Cache and Reconfigure" and "View Cache."
- Implemented the **`/scanDependencies`** compiler option to list C++20 module dependencies for CMake projects, as described in [P1689R5](https://wg21.link/P1689r5). It's a step towards support for building modules-based projects with CMake and we're working on completing this support in later releases.

### Standard Library improvements

Select Standard Library (STL) improvements are highlighted here. For a comprehensive list of new functionality, changes, bug fixes, and performance improvements, see the STL team's [Changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/wiki/Changelog).

- Added debugging visualizers to improve how the following types are displayed: `source_location`, `bind_front()`, `u8string` (and its iterators), `default_sentinel_t`, `unreachable_sentinel_t`, `ranges::empty_view`, `ranges::single_view`, `ranges::iota_view` (and its iterator/sentinel), `ranges::ref_view`, `thread`, `thread::id`, `jthread`, and `filesystem::path`
- Added `[[nodiscard]]` to the `stoi()` family of functions in `<string>` and to various functions in `<locale>` such as the `collate` member functions, `has_facet()`, and the `isalnum()` and `tolower()` families.
- [P0980R1](https://wg21.link/P0980R1) Made `std::string` `constexpr` in VS 2019 16.10. Now supported for Clang.
- [P1004R2](https://wg21.link/P1004R2) Made `std::vector` `constexpr` in VS 2019 16.10. Now supported for Clang.

**Highlighted C++23 features**

- [P1048R1](https://wg21.link/P1048R1) Added `is_scoped_enum`, a new trait for the C++ Standard library, which detects whether a type is a scoped enumeration.
- [P1132R7](https://wg21.link/P1132R7) `out_ptr()`, `inout_ptr()`
- [P1679R3](https://wg21.link/P1679R3) `contains()` For `basic_string` and `basic_string_view`
- [P1682R3](https://wg21.link/P1682R3) `to_underlying()` for enumerations
- [P2162R2](https://wg21.link/P2162R2) Allow inheriting from `std::variant`
- [P2166R1](https://wg21.link/P2166R1) Prohibit constructing `basic_string` and `basic_string_view` from `nullptr`. This change is a source-breaking change. Code that previously had undefined behavior at runtime is now rejected with compiler errors.
- [P2186R2](https://wg21.link/P2186R2) Removed garbage collection support. This change removes `declare_reachable`, `undeclare_reachable`, `declare_no_pointers`, `undeclare_no_pointers`, `get_pointer_safety`. Previously, these functions had no effect.

**Highlighted performance improvements**

- `<format>` now detects when it's writing to a `back_insert_iterator` for a `basic_string` or a `vector`, and makes a faster call to `insert()` at the `end()` of the container.
- We improved the performance of `std::find()` and `std::count()` for `vector<bool>` 19x and 26x (times, not percent).
- We improved the performance of `std::count()` for `vector<bool>`
- `std::byte` now has the same performance as `unsigned char` in `reverse()` and `variant::swap()`

### Clang and LLVM support

- LLVM tools shipped with Visual Studio are upgraded to LLVM 12. For more information, see the [LLVM release notes](https://releases.llvm.org/12.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html).

- Clang-cl support was updated to LLVM 12.
- You can now debug processes running on a remote system from Visual Studio by using LLDB.

### C++ AMP deprecated

- C++ AMP headers are now deprecated. Including `<amp.h>` in a C++ project generates build errors. To silence the errors, define `_SILENCE_AMP_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS`. For more information, see [our AMP Deprecation links](../parallel/amp/cpp-amp-overview.md).

### IntelliSense improvements

- We made improvements in C++ IntelliSense when providing navigation and syntax highlighting for types from imported Modules and Header Units. IntelliSense is an active area of investment for us. Help us improve: Share your feedback on Developer Community by using **Help** > **Send Feedback**.
- We improved C++ IntelliSense performance by optimizing cached header usage and symbol database access, providing improved load times to get into your code.
- The IntelliSense Code Linter for C++ is now on by default, providing instant as-you-type suggestions and fix suggestions for common code defects.
- C++ IntelliSense for CMake projects now works when using a preset with a display name.

### C++ Workload updates

- Updated to NDK r21 LTS in the **C++ Mobile Development** workload.
- The **Game development with C++** workload now installs the latest Unreal Engine with support for Visual Studio 2022.

### Code analysis improvements

- Code analysis now enforces that return values of functions annotated with `_Check_return_` or `_Must_inspect_result_` must be checked.
- Null pointer dereference detection is improved in our code analysis tooling.
- Added support for `gsl::not_null` to code analysis.
- Support for Libfuzzer under the **`/fsanitize=fuzzer`** compiler option.
