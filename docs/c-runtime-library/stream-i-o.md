# Stream I/O

These functions process data in different sizes and formats, from single characters to large data structures. They also provide buffering, which can improve performance. The default size of a stream buffer is 4K. These routines affect only buffers created by the run-time library routines, and have no effect on buffers created by the operating system.

 When a program begins execution, the startup code automatically opens several streams: standard input (pointed to by **stdin**), standard output (pointed to by **stdout**), and standard error (pointed to by **stderr**). These streams are directed to the console (keyboard and screen) by default. Use **freopen** to redirect **stdin**, **stdout**, or **stderr** to a disk file or a device.

 Files opened using the stream routines are buffered by default. The **stdout** and **stderr** functions are flushed whenever they are full or, if you are writing to a character device, after each library call. If a program terminates abnormally, output buffers may not be flushed, resulting in loss of data. Use **fflush** or **_flushall** to ensure that the buffer associated with a specified file or all open buffers are flushed to the operating system, which can cache data before writing it to disk. The commit-to-disk feature ensures that the flushed buffer contents are not lost in the event of a system failure.

 There are two ways to commit buffer contents to disk:

-   Link with the file COMMODE.OBJ to set a global commit flag. The default setting of the global flag is **n**, for "no-commit."

-   Set the mode flag to **c** with **fopen** or **_fdopen**.

 Any file specifically opened with either the **c** or the **n** flag behaves according to the flag, regardless of the state of the global commit/no-commit flag.

 If your program does not explicitly close a stream, the stream is automatically closed when the program terminates. However, you should close a stream when your program finishes with it, as the number of streams that can be open at one time is limited. See [_setmaxstdio](../c-runtime-library/reference/setmaxstdio.md) for information on this limit.

 Input can follow output directly only with an intervening call to **fflush** or to a file-positioning function (**fseek**, **fsetpos**, or **rewind**). Output can follow input without an intervening call to a file-positioning function if the input operation encounters the end of the file.
