# Debug routines

The debug version of the C runtime library supplies many diagnostic services that make debugging programs easier and allow developers to:

- Step directly into run-time functions during debugging

- Resolve assertions, errors, and exceptions

- Trace heap allocations and prevent memory leaks

- Report debug messages to the user

## Debug versions of the C runtime library routines

To use these routines, the [_DEBUG](../c-runtime-library/debug.md) flag must be defined. All of these routines do nothing in a retail build of an application. For more information on how to use the new debug routines, see [CRT Debugging Techniques](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debugging-techniques).

## C runtime routines that are not available in source code form

The debugger can be used to step through the source code for most of the C runtime routines during the debugging process. However, Microsoft considers some technology to be proprietary and, therefore, does not provide the source code for a subset of these routines. Most of these routines belong to either the exception handling or floating-point processing groups, but a few others are included as well. The following table lists these routines.

||||

|[tan](../c-runtime-library/reference/tan-tanf-tanl.md)|[tanh](../c-runtime-library/reference/tanh-tanhf-tanhl.md)||

Although source code is available for most of the **printf** and **scanf** routines, they make an internal call to another routine for which source code is not provided.

## Routines that behave differently in a debug build of an application

Some C run-time functions and C++ operators behave differently when called from a debug build of an application. (Note that a debug build of an application can be done by either defining the `_DEBUG` flag or by linking with a debug version of the C run-time library.) The behavioral differences usually consist of extra features or information provided by the routine to support the debugging process. The following table lists these routines.

|||
|-|-|
|C [abort](../c-runtime-library/reference/abort.md) routine|C++ [delete](../cpp/delete-operator-cpp.md) operator|
|C [assert](../c-runtime-library/reference/assert-macro-assert-wassert.md) routine|C++ [new](../cpp/new-operator-cpp.md) operator|
