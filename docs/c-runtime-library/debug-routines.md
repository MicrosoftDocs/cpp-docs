# Debug Routines
The debug version of the C run-time library supplies many diagnostic services that make debugging programs easier and allow developers to:  
  
-   Step directly into run-time functions during debugging  
  
-   Resolve assertions, errors, and exceptions  
  
-   Trace heap allocations and prevent memory leaks  
  
-   Report debug messages to the user  
  
 To use these routines, the [_DEBUG](../c-runtime-library/debug.md) flag must be defined. All of these routines do nothing in a retail build of an application. For more information on how to use the new debug routines, see [CRT Debugging Techniques](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debugging-techniques).

 The debug routines can be used to step through the source code for most of the other C run-time routines during the debugging process. However, Microsoft considers some technology to be proprietary and, therefore, does not provide the source code for these routines. Most of these routines belong to either the exception handling or floating-point processing groups, but a few others are included as well. The following table lists these routines.

 \*   Although source code is available for most of this routine, it makes an internal call to another routine for which source code is not provided.  
  
 Some C run-time functions and C++ operators behave differently when called from a debug build of an application. (Note that a debug build of an application can be done by either defining the `_DEBUG` flag or by linking with a debug version of the C run-time library.) The behavioral differences usually consist of extra features or information provided by the routine to support the debugging process. The following table lists these routines.  
  
### Routines that Behave Differently in a Debug Build of an Application

|-|-|  
|C [abort](../c-runtime-library/reference/abort.md) routine|C++ [delete](../cpp/delete-operator-cpp.md) operator|
