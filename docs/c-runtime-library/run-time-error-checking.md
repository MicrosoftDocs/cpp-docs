# Run-Time Error Checking

The C run-time library contains the functions that support run-time error checks (RTC). Run-time error checking allows you to build your program such that certain kinds of run-time errors are reported. You specify how the errors are reported and which kinds of errors are reported. For more information, see [How to: Use Native Run-Time Checks](/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-use-native-run-time-checks).

 Use the following functions to customize the way your program does run-time error checking.

## Run-Time Error Checking Functions

|Function|Use|
|--------------|---------|
|[_RTC_GetErrDesc](../c-runtime-library/reference/rtc-geterrdesc.md)|Returns a brief description of a run-time error check type.|
|[_RTC_NumErrors](../c-runtime-library/reference/rtc-numerrors.md)|Returns the total number of errors that can be detected by run-time error checks.|
|[_RTC_SetErrorFunc](../c-runtime-library/reference/rtc-seterrorfunc.md)|Designates a function as the handler for reporting run-time error checks.|
|[_RTC_SetErrorType](../c-runtime-library/reference/rtc-seterrortype.md)|Associates an error that is detected by run-time error checks with a type.|
