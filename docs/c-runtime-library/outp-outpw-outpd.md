# _outp, _outpw, _outpd
Outputs, at a port, a byte (`_outp`), a word (`_outpw`), or a double word (`_outpd`).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  These functions are obsolete. Beginning in Visual Studio 2015, they are not available in the CRT.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      int _outp(  
unsigned short port,  
int databyte   
);  
unsigned short _outpw(  
unsigned short port,  
unsigned short dataword   
);  
unsigned long _outpd(  
unsigned short port,  
unsigned long dataword   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *port*  
 Port number.  
  
 *databyte, dataword*  
 Output values.  
  
## Return Value  
 The functions return the data output. There is no error return.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `_outp`, `_outpw`, and `_outpd` functions write a byte, a word, and a double word, respectively, to the specified output port. The *port* argument can be any unsigned integer in the range 0 - 65,535; *databyte* can be any integer in the range 0 - 255; and *dataword* can be any value in the range of an integer, an unsigned short integer, and an unsigned long integer, respectively.  
  
 Because these functions write directly to an I/O port, they cannot be used in user code. For information about using I/O ports in these operating systems, search for "Serial Communications in Win32" at MSDN.
