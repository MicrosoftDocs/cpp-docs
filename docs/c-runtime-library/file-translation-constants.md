# File Translation Constants
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
#include <stdio.h>  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 These constants specify the mode of translation (**"b"** or **"t"**). The mode is included in the string specifying the type of access (**"r"**, **"w"**, **"a"**, **"r+"**, **"w+"**, **"a+"**).  
  
 The translation modes are as follows:  
  
 **t**  
 Opens in text (translated) mode. In this mode, carriage-return/linefeed (CR-LF) combinations are translated into single linefeeds (LF) on input, and LF characters are translated into CR-LF combinations on output. Also, CTRL+Z is interpreted as an end-of-file character on input. In files opened for reading or reading/writing, `fopen` checks for CTRL+Z at the end of the file and removes it, if possible. This is done because using the `fseek` and `ftell` functions to move within a file ending with CTRL+Z may cause `fseek` to behave improperly near the end of the file.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **t** option is not part of the ANSI standard for `fopen` and `freopen`. It is a Microsoft extension and should not be used where ANSI portability is desired.  
  
 **b**  
 Opens in binary (untranslated) mode. The above translations are suppressed.  
  
 If **t** or **b** is not given in *mode*, the translation mode is defined by the default-mode variable [_fmode](../c-runtime-library/fmode.md). For more information about using text and binary modes, see [Text and Binary Mode File I/O](../c-runtime-library/text-and-binary-mode-file-i-o.md).
