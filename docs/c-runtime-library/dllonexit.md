# __dllonexit
Registers a routine to be called at exit time.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
_onexit_t __dllonexit(   _onexit_t func,  
   _PVFV **  pbegin,   
   _PVFV **  pend   
   )  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `func`  
 Pointer to a function to be executed upon exit.  
  
 `pbegin`  
 Pointer to a variable that points to the beginning of a list of functions to execute on detach.  
  
 `pend`  
 Pointer to variable that points to the end of a list of functions to execute on detach.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, a pointer to the userâ€™s function. Otherwise, a **NULL** pointer.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `__dllonexit` function is analogous to the [_onexit](../c-runtime-library/reference/onexit-onexit-m.md) function except that the global variables used by that function are not visible to this routine. Instead of global variables, this function uses the `pbegin` and `pend` parameters.  
  
 The `_onexit` and `atexit` functions in a DLL linked with MSVCRT.LIB must maintain their own atexit/_onexit list. This routine is the worker that gets called by such DLLs.  
  
 The `_PVFV` type is defined as `typedef void (__cdecl *_PVFV)(void)`.
