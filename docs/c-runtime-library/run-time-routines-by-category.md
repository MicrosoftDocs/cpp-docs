# Universal C runtime routines by category

This section lists and describes Universal C runtime (UCRT) library routines by category. For reference convenience, some routines are listed in more than one category. Multibyte-character routines and wide-character routines are grouped with single-byte character counterparts, where they exist.

## UCRT library routine categories

The main categories of UCRT library routines are:

|||
|-|-|
|[Argument Access](../c-runtime-library/argument-access.md)|[Buffer Manipulation](../c-runtime-library/buffer-manipulation.md)|
|[Byte Classification](../c-runtime-library/byte-classification.md)|[Character Classification](../c-runtime-library/character-classification.md)|
|[Complex math support](../c-runtime-library/complex-math-support.md)||
|[Data Alignment](../c-runtime-library/data-alignment.md)|[Data Conversion](../c-runtime-library/data-conversion.md)|
|[Debug Routines](../c-runtime-library/debug-routines.md)|[Directory Control](../c-runtime-library/directory-control.md)|
|[Error Handling](../c-runtime-library/error-handling-crt.md)|[Exception Handling Routines](../c-runtime-library/exception-handling-routines.md)|
|[File Handling](../c-runtime-library/file-handling.md)|[Floating-Point Support](../c-runtime-library/floating-point-support.md)|
|[Input and Output](../c-runtime-library/input-and-output.md)|[Internationalization](../c-runtime-library/internationalization.md)|
|[Memory Allocation](../c-runtime-library/memory-allocation.md)|[Process and Environment Control](../c-runtime-library/process-and-environment-control.md)|
|[Robustness](../c-runtime-library/robustness.md)|[Run-Time Error Checking](../c-runtime-library/run-time-error-checking.md)|
|[Searching and Sorting](../c-runtime-library/searching-and-sorting.md)|[String Manipulation](../c-runtime-library/string-manipulation-crt.md)|
