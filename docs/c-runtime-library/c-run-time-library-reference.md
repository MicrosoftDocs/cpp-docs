# Microsoft C runtime library (CRT) reference

The Microsoft runtime library provides routines for programming the Microsoft Windows operating system. These routines automate many common programming tasks that aren't provided by the C and C++ languages.

Sample programs are included in the individual reference articles for most routines in the library.

## In this section

[Universal C runtime routines by category](run-time-routines-by-category.md)\
Provides links to the runtime library by category.

[Global variables and standard types](global-variables-and-standard-types.md)\
Provides links to the global variables and standard types provided by the runtime library.

[Global constants](global-constants.md)\
Provides links to the global constants defined by the runtime library.

[Global state](global-state.md)\
Describes the scope of global state in the C runtime library.

[Generic-text mappings](generic-text-mappings.md)\
Provides links to the generic-text mappings defined in Tchar.h.

[Alphabetical function reference](reference/crt-alphabetical-function-reference.md)\
Provides links to the C runtime library functions, organized alphabetically.

[Function family overviews](function-family-overviews.md)\
Provides links to the C runtime library functions, organized by function family.

[Language and country/region strings](locale-names-languages-and-country-region-strings.md)\
