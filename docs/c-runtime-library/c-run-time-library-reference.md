# C Run-Time Library Reference

The Microsoft run-time library provides routines for programming for the Microsoft Windows operating system. These routines automate many common programming tasks that are not provided by the C and C++ languages.

 Sample programs are included in the individual reference topics for most routines in the library.

## In This Section

 [C Run-Time Libraries](../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md)
 Discusses the .lib files that comprise the C run-time libraries.

 [Universal C runtime routines by category](../c-runtime-library/run-time-routines-by-category.md)
 Provides links to the run-time library by category.

 [Global Variables and Standard Types](../c-runtime-library/global-variables-and-standard-types.md)
 Provides links to the global variables and standard types provided by the run-time library.

 [Global Constants](../c-runtime-library/global-constants.md)
 Provides links to the global constants defined by the run-time library.

 [Alphabetical Function Reference](../c-runtime-library/reference/crt-alphabetical-function-reference.md)
 Provides a table of contents entry point into an alphabetical listing of all C run-time library functions.

 [Generic-Text Mappings](../c-runtime-library/generic-text-mappings.md)
 Provides links to the generic-text mappings defined in Tchar.h.

 [Language and Country/Region Strings](../c-runtime-library/locale-names-languages-and-country-region-strings.md)
 Describes how to use the `setlocale` function to set the language and Country/Region strings.

## Related Sections

 [Debug Routines](../c-runtime-library/debug-routines.md)
 Provides links to the debug versions of the run-time library routines.

 [Run-Time Error Checking](../c-runtime-library/run-time-error-checking.md)
 Provides links to functions that support run-time error checks.

 [DLLs and Visual C++ run-time library behavior](../build/run-time-library-behavior.md)
 Discusses the entry point and startup code used for a DLL.

 [Debugging](/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio)
 Provides links to using the Visual Studio debugger to correct logic errors in your application or stored procedures.
