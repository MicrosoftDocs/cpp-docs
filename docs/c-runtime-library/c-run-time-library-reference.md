# C Run-Time Library Reference

The Microsoft run-time library provides routines for programming for the Microsoft Windows operating system. These routines automate many common programming tasks that are not provided by the C and C++ languages.

Sample programs are included in the individual reference topics for most routines in the library.

## In This Section

[C Run-Time Libraries](../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md)<br/>
Discusses the .lib files that comprise the C run-time libraries.

[Universal C runtime routines by category](../c-runtime-library/run-time-routines-by-category.md)<br/>
Provides links to the run-time library by category.

[Global Variables and Standard Types](../c-runtime-library/global-variables-and-standard-types.md)<br/>
Provides links to the global variables and standard types provided by the run-time library.

[Global Constants](../c-runtime-library/global-constants.md)<br/>
Provides links to the global constants defined by the run-time library.

[Alphabetical Function Reference](../c-runtime-library/reference/crt-alphabetical-function-reference.md)<br/>
Provides a table of contents entry point into an alphabetical listing of all C run-time library functions.

[Generic-Text Mappings](../c-runtime-library/generic-text-mappings.md)<br/>
Provides links to the generic-text mappings defined in Tchar.h.

[Language and Country/Region Strings](../c-runtime-library/locale-names-languages-and-country-region-strings.md)<br/>
Describes how to use the `setlocale` function to set the language and Country/Region strings.

## Related Sections

[Debug Routines](../c-runtime-library/debug-routines.md)<br/>
Provides links to the debug versions of the run-time library routines.

[Run-Time Error Checking](../c-runtime-library/run-time-error-checking.md)<br/>
Provides links to functions that support run-time error checks.

[DLLs and Visual C++ run-time library behavior](../build/run-time-library-behavior.md)<br/>
Discusses the entry point and startup code used for a DLL.

[Debugging](/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio)<br/>
Provides links to using the Visual Studio debugger to correct logic errors in your application or stored procedures.
