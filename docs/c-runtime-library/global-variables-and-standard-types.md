# Global Variables and Standard Types

The Microsoft run-time library contains definitions for [global variables](../c-runtime-library/global-variables.md), [control flags](../c-runtime-library/control-flags.md), and [standard types](../c-runtime-library/standard-types.md) used by library routines. Access these variables, flags, and types by declaring them in your program or by including the appropriate header files.
