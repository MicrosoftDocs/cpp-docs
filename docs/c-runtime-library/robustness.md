Use the following C run-time library functions to improve the robustness of your program.

|[_set_new_handler](../c-runtime-library/reference/set-new-handler.md)|Transfers control to your error-handling mechanism if the **new** operator fails to allocate memory.|
|[_set_se_translator](../c-runtime-library/reference/set-se-translator.md)|Handles Win32 exceptions (C structured exceptions) as C++ typed exceptions.|
|[set_terminate](../c-runtime-library/reference/set-terminate-crt.md)|Installs your own termination function to be called by [terminate](../c-runtime-library/reference/terminate-crt.md).|
|[set_unexpected](../c-runtime-library/reference/set-unexpected-crt.md)|Installs your own termination function to be called by [unexpected](../c-runtime-library/reference/unexpected-crt.md).|
