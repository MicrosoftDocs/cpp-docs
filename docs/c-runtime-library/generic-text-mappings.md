# Generic-Text Mappings

To simplify writing code for international markets, generic-text mappings are defined in TCHAR.H for:

- [Data types](../c-runtime-library/data-type-mappings.md)

- [Constants and global variables](../c-runtime-library/constant-and-global-variable-mappings.md)

- [Routine mappings](../c-runtime-library/routine-mappings.md)

For more information, see [Using Generic-Text Mappings](../c-runtime-library/using-generic-text-mappings.md). Generic-text mappings are Microsoft extensions that are not ANSI compatible.
