# fetestexcept

Determines which of the specified floating-point exception status flags are currently set.

## Syntax

```C
int fetestexcept(
   int excepts
);

```

### Parameters

*excepts*<br/>
A bitwise OR of the floating-point     status flags to test.

## Return Value

On success, returns a bitmask containing a bitwise OR of the floating-point exception macros that correspond to the exception status flags currently set. Returns 0 if none of the exceptions are set.

## Remarks

Use the fetestexcept function to determine which exceptions were raised by a floating point operation. Use the *excepts* parameter to specify which exception status flags to test. The **fetestexcept** function uses these exception macros defined in \<fenv.h> in *excepts* and the return value:

|Exception Macro|Description|
|---------------------|-----------------|
|FE_DIVBYZERO|A singularity or pole error occurred in an earlier floating-point operation; an infinity value was created.|
|FE_INEXACT|The function was forced to round the stored result of an earlier floating-point operation.|
|FE_INVALID|A domain error occurred in an earlier floating-point operation.|
|FE_OVERFLOW|A range error occurred; an earlier floating-point operation result was too large to be represented.|
|FE_UNDERFLOW|An earlier floating-point operation result was too small to be represented at full precision; a denormal value was created.|
|FE_ALLEXCEPT|The bitwise OR of all supported floating-point exceptions.|

The specified *excepts* argument may be 0, one of the supported floating-point exception macros, or the bitwise OR of two or more of the macros. The effect of any other *excepts* argument value is undefined.

To use this function, you must turn off floating-point optimizations that could prevent access by using the `#pragma fenv_access(on)` directive prior to the call. For more information, see [fenv_access](../../preprocessor/fenv-access.md).

## Requirements

|Function|C header|C++ header|
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
|**fetestexcept**|\<fenv.h>|\<cfenv>|

For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).
