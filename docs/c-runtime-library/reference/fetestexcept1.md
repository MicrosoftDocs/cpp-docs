# fetestexcept
Determines which of the specified floating-point exception status flags are currently set.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
int fetestexcept(  
   int excepts  
);  
  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `excepts`  
 A bitwise OR of the floating-point     status flags to test.  
  
## Return Value  
 On success, returns a bitmask containing a bitwise OR of the floating-point exception macros that correspond to the exception status flags currently set. Returns 0 if none of the exceptions are set.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use the fetestexcept function to determine which exceptions were raised by a floating point operation. Use the `excepts` parameter to specify which exception status flags to test. The `fetestexcept` function uses these exception macros defined in \<fenv.h> in `excepts` and the return value:  
  
|Exception Macro|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|FE_DIVBYZERO|A singularity or pole error occurred in an earlier floating-point operation; an infinity value was created.|  
|FE_INEXACT|The function was forced to round the stored result of an earlier floating-point operation.|  
|FE_INVALID|A domain error occurred in an earlier floating-point operation.|  
|FE_OVERFLOW|A range error occurred; an earlier floating-point operation result was too large to be represented.|  
|FE_UNDERFLOW|An earlier floating-point operation result was too small to be represented at full precision; a denormal value was created.|  
|FE_ALLEXCEPT|The bitwise OR of all supported floating-point exceptions.|  
  
 The specified `excepts` argument may be 0, one of the supported floating-point exception macros, or the bitwise OR of two or more of the macros. The effect of any other `excepts` argument value is undefined.  
  
 To use this function, you must turn off floating-point optimizations that could prevent access by using the `#pragma fenv_access(on)` directive prior to the call. For more information, see [fenv_access](../../preprocessor/fenv-access.md).  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Function|C header|C++ header|

|`fetestexcept`|\<fenv.h>|\<cfenv>|
