# _spawnlpe, _wspawnlpe
Creates and executes a new process.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../../atl/reference/includes/wrt_md.md)]. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported with /ZW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj606124.aspx).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
intptr_t _spawnlpe(  
   int mode,  
   const char *cmdname,  
   const char *arg0,  
   const char *arg1,  
   ... const char *argn,  
   NULL,  
   const char *const *envp   
);  
intptr_t _wspawnlpe(  
   int mode,  
   const wchar_t *cmdname,  
   const wchar_t *arg0,  
   const wchar_t *arg1,  
   ... const wchar_t *argn,  
   NULL,  
   const wchar_t *const *envp   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `mode`  
 Execution mode for the calling process.  
  
 `cmdname`  
 Path of the file to be executed.  
  
 `arg0, arg1, ... argn`  
 List of pointers to arguments. The `arg0` argument is typically a pointer to `cmdname`. The arguments `arg1` through `argn` are pointers to the character strings that form the new argument list. Following `argn`, there must be a `NULL` pointer to mark the end of the argument list.  
  
 `envp`  
 Array of pointers to environment settings.  
  
## Return Value  
 The return value from a synchronous `_spawnlpe` or `_wspawnlpe` (`_P_WAIT` specified for `mode`) is the exit status of the new process. The return value from an asynchronous `_spawnlpe` or `_wspawnlpe` (`_P_NOWAIT` or `_P_NOWAITO` specified for `mode`) is the process handle. The exit status is 0 if the process terminated normally. You can set the exit status to a nonzero value if the spawned process specifically uses a nonzero argument to call the `exit` routine. If the new process did not explicitly set a positive exit status, a positive exit status indicates an abnormal exit caused by an abort or an interrupt. A return value of –1 indicates an error (the new process is not started). In this case, `errno` is set to one of the following values.  
  
 `E2BIG`  
 Argument list exceeds 1024 bytes.  
  
 `EINVAL`  
 `mode` argument is invalid.  
  
 `ENOENT`  
 File or path is not found.  
  
 `ENOEXEC`  
 Specified file is not executable or has an invalid executable-file format.  
  
 `ENOMEM`  
 Not enough memory is available to execute the new process.  
  
 For more information about these and other return codes, see [errno, _doserrno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 Each of these functions creates and executes a new process, passes each command-line argument as a separate parameter, and passes an array of pointers to environment settings. These functions use the `PATH` environment variable to find the file to execute.  
  
 These functions validate their parameters. If either `cmdname` or `arg0` is an empty string or a null pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions set `errno` to `EINVAL`, and return -1. No new process is spawned.  
  
## Requirements
