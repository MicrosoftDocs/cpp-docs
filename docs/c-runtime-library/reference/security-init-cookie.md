# __security_init_cookie

Initializes the global security cookie.

## Syntax

```C
void __security_init_cookie(void);
```

## Remarks

The global security cookie is used for buffer overrun protection in code compiled with [/GS (Buffer Security Check)](../../build/reference/gs-buffer-security-check.md) and in code that uses exception handling. On entry to an overrun-protected function, the cookie is put on the stack, and on exit, the value on the stack is compared with the global cookie. Any difference between them indicates that a buffer overrun has occurred and causes immediate termination of the program.

Normally, **__security_init_cookie** is called by the CRT when it is initialized. If you bypass CRT initialization—for example, if you use [/ENTRY](../../build/reference/entry-entry-point-symbol.md) to specify an entry-point—then you must call **__security_init_cookie** yourself. If **__security_init_cookie** is not called, the global security cookie is set to a default value and buffer overrun protection is compromised. Because an attacker can exploit this default cookie value to defeat the buffer overrun checks, we recommend that you always call **__security_init_cookie** when you define your own entry point.

The call to **__security_init_cookie** must be made before any overrun-protected function is entered; otherwise a spurious buffer overrun will be detected. For more information, see [C Runtime Error R6035](../../error-messages/tool-errors/c-runtime-error-r6035.md).

## Example

See the examples in [C Runtime Error R6035](../../error-messages/tool-errors/c-runtime-error-r6035.md).
