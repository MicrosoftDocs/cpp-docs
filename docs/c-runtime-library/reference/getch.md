# getch

The Microsoft-specific function name `getch` is a deprecated alias for the [_getch](getch-getwch.md) function. By default, it generates [Compiler warning (level 3) C4996](../../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4996.md). The name is deprecated because it doesn't follow the Standard C rules for implementation-specific names. However, the function is still supported.

We recommend you use [_getch](getch-getwch.md) instead. Or, you can continue to use this function name, and disable the warning. For more information, see [Turn off the warning](../../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4996.md#turn-off-the-warning) and [POSIX function names](../../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4996.md#posix-function-names).
