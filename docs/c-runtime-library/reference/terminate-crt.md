# terminate (CRT)
Calls `abort` or a function you specify using `set_terminate`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
void terminate( void );  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The `terminate` function is used with C++ exception handling and is called in the following cases:  
  
-   A matching catch handler cannot be found for a thrown C++ exception.  
  
-   An exception is thrown by a destructor function during stack unwind.  
  
-   The stack is corrupted after throwing an exception.  
  
 `terminate` calls `abort` by default. You can change this default by writing your own termination function and calling `set_terminate` with the name of your function as its argument. `terminate` calls the last function given as an argument to `set_terminate`. For more information, see [Unhandled C++ Exceptions](../../cpp/unhandled-cpp-exceptions.md).  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Routine|Required header|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|`terminate`|\<eh.h>|  
  
 For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// crt_terminate.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <eh.h>  
#include <process.h>  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
  
void term_func();  
  
int main()  
{  
    int i = 10, j = 0, result;  
    set_terminate( term_func );  
    try  
    {  
        if( j == 0 )  
            throw "Divide by zero!";  
        else  
            result = i/j;  
    }  
    catch( int )  
    {  
        cout << "Caught some integer exception.\n";  
    }  
    cout << "This should never print.\n";  
}  
  
void term_func()  
{  
    cout << "term_func() was called by terminate().\n";  
  
    // ... cleanup tasks performed here  
  
    // If this function does not exit, abort is called.  
  
    exit(-1);  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
term_func() was called by terminate().  
```  
  
## .NET Framework Equivalent  
 Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`. For more information, see [Platform Invoke Examples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/15926806-f0b7-487e-93a6-4e9367ec689f).
