# fclose, _fcloseall

Closes a stream (**fclose**) or closes all open streams (**_fcloseall**).

## Syntax

```C
int fclose(
   FILE *stream
);
int _fcloseall( void );
```

### Parameters

*stream*<br/>
Pointer to **FILE** structure.

## Return Value

**fclose** returns 0 if the stream is successfully closed. **_fcloseall** returns the total number of streams closed. Both functions return **EOF** to indicate an error.

## Remarks

The **fclose** function closes *stream*. If *stream* is **NULL**, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, **fclose** sets **errno** to **EINVAL** and returns **EOF**. It is recommended that the *stream* pointer always be checked prior to calling this function.

See [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md) for more information on these, and other, error codes.

The **_fcloseall** function closes all open streams except **stdin**, **stdout**, **stderr** (and, in MS-DOS, **_stdaux** and **_stdprn**). It also closes and deletes any temporary files created by **tmpfile**. In both functions, all buffers associated with the stream are flushed prior to closing. System-allocated buffers are released when the stream is closed. Buffers assigned by the user with **setbuf** and **setvbuf** are not automatically released.

**Note:** When these functions are used to close a stream, the underlying file descriptor and OS file handle (or socket) are closed, as well as the stream. Thus, if the file was originally opened as a file handle or file descriptor and is closed with **fclose**, do not also call **_close** to close the file descriptor; do not call the Win32 function **CloseHandle** to close the file handle.

**fclose** and **_fcloseall** include code to protect against interference from other threads. For non-locking version of a **fclose**, see **_fclose_nolock**.

## Requirements

|Function|Required header|
|--------------|---------------------|
|**fclose**|\<stdio.h>|
|**_fcloseall**|\<stdio.h>|

For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).
