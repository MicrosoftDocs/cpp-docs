# _aligned_msize
Returns the size of a memory block allocated in the heap.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
size_t _msize(  
   void *memblock,  
   size_t alignment,  
   size_t offset  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 [in] `memblock`  
 Pointer to the memory block.  
  
 [in] `alignment`  
 The alignment value, which must be an integer power of 2.  
  
 [in] `offset`  
 The offset into the memory allocation to force the alignment.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns the size (in bytes) as an unsigned integer.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `_aligned_msize` function returns the size, in bytes, of the memory block allocated by a call to [_aligned_malloc](../../c-runtime-library/reference/aligned-malloc.md) or [_aligned_realloc](../../c-runtime-library/reference/aligned-realloc.md). The `alignment` and `offset` values must be the same as the values passed to the function that allocated the block.  
  
 When the application is linked with a debug version of the C run-time libraries, `_aligned_msize` resolves to [_aligned_msize_dbg](../../c-runtime-library/reference/aligned-msize-dbg.md). For more information about how the heap is managed during the debugging process, see [The CRT Debug Heap](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debug-heap-details).  
  
 This function validates its parameter. If `memblock` is a null pointer or `alignment` is not a power of 2, `_msize` invokes an invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If the error is handled, the function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns -1.

 For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  
  
## Libraries  
 All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).  
  
## .NET Framework Equivalent  
 Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`. For more information, see [Platform Invoke Examples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/15926806-f0b7-487e-93a6-4e9367ec689f).
