# `_cscanf_s`, `_cscanf_s_l`, `_cwscanf_s`, `_cwscanf_s_l`

Reads formatted data from the console. These more secure versions of [`_cscanf`, `_cscanf_l`, `_cwscanf`, `_cwscanf_l`](cscanf-cscanf-l-cwscanf-cwscanf-l.md) have security enhancements, as described in [Security features in the CRT](../security-features-in-the-crt.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

## Syntax

```C
int _cscanf_s(
   const char *format [,
   argument] ...
);
int _cscanf_s_l(
   const char *format,
   _locale_t locale [,
   argument] ...
);
int _cwscanf_s(
   const wchar_t *format [,
   argument] ...
);
int _cwscanf_s_l(
   const wchar_t *format,
   _locale_t locale [,
   argument] ...
);
```

### Parameters

*`format`*\
Format-control string.

*`argument`*\
Optional parameters.

*`locale`*\
The locale to use.

## Return value

The number of fields that were successfully converted and assigned. The return value doesn't include fields that were read but not assigned. The return value is `EOF` for an attempt to read at end of file. An `EOF` can also be returned when keyboard input is redirected at the operating-system command-line level. A return value of zero means that no fields were assigned.

These functions validate their parameters. If *`format`* is a null pointer, these functions invoke the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter validation](../parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return `EOF`, and `errno` is set to `EINVAL`.

## Remarks

The **`_cscanf_s`** function reads data directly from the console into the locations given by *`argument`*. The [`_getche`](getch-getwch.md) function is used to read characters. Each optional parameter must be a pointer to a variable with a type that corresponds to a type specifier in *`format`*. The format controls the interpretation of the input fields and has the same form and function as the *`format`* parameter for the [`scanf_s`](scanf-scanf-l-wscanf-wscanf-l.md) function. While **`_cscanf_s`** normally echoes the input character, it doesn't do so if the last call was to `_ungetch`.

Like other secure versions of functions in the `scanf` family, **`_cscanf_s`** and **`_cwscanf_s`** require size arguments for the type field characters **c**, **C**, **s**, **S**, and **[**. For more information, see [scanf Width Specification](../scanf-width-specification.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The size parameter is of type **`unsigned`**, not `size_t`.

The versions of these functions with the `_l` suffix are identical except that they use the locale parameter passed in instead of the current thread locale.

### Generic-text routine mappings

| TCHAR.H routine | `_UNICODE` and `_MBCS` not defined | `_MBCS` defined | `_UNICODE` defined |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_tcscanf_s` | **`_cscanf_s`** | **`_cscanf_s`** | **`_cwscanf_s`** |
| `_tcscanf_s_l` | **`_cscanf_s_l`** | **`_cscanf_s_l`** | **`_cwscanf_s_l`** |

## Requirements

| Routine | Required header |
|---|---|
| **`_cscanf_s`**, **`_cscanf_s_l`** | \<conio.h> |
| **`_cwscanf_s`**, **`_cwscanf_s_l`** | \<conio.h> or \<wchar.h> |

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../compatibility.md).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../crt-library-features.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_cscanf_s.c
/* This program prompts for a string
* and uses _cscanf_s to read in the response.
* Then _cscanf_s returns the number of items
* matched, and the program displays that number.
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>

int main( void )
{
   int result, n[3];
   int i;

   result = _cscanf_s( "%i %i %i", &n[0], &n[1], &n[2] );
   _cprintf_s( "\r\nYou entered " );
   for( i=0; i<result; i++ )
      _cprintf_s( "%i ", n[i] );
   _cprintf_s( "\r\n" );
}
```

```Input
1 2 3
```

```Output
You entered 1 2 3
```
