# _setmaxstdio

Sets a maximum for the number of simultaneously open files at the **stdio** level.

## Syntax

```C
int _setmaxstdio(
   int newmax
);
```

### Parameters

*newmax*<br/>
New maximum for the number of simultaneously open files at the **stdio** level.

## Return Value

Returns *newmax* if successful; -1 otherwise.

If *newmax* is less than **_IOB_ENTRIES** or greater then the maximum number of handles available in the operating system, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function returns -1 and sets **errno** to **EINVAL**.

For information about these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Remarks

The **_setmaxstdio** function changes the maximum value for the number of files that might be simultaneously open at the **stdio** level.

C run-time I/O now supports many more open files on Win32 platforms than in previous versions. Up to 2,048 files can be open simultaneously at the [lowio level](../../c-runtime-library/low-level-i-o.md) (that is, opened and accessed by means of the **_open**, **_read**, **_write**, and so forth family of I/O functions). Up to 512 files can be open simultaneously at the [stdio level](../../c-runtime-library/stream-i-o.md) (that is, opened and accessed by means of the **fopen**, **fgetc**, **fputc**, and so forth family of functions). The limit of 512 open files at the **stdio** level can be increased to a maximum of 2,048 by means of the **_setmaxstdio** function.

Because **stdio**-level functions, such as **fopen**, are built on top of the **lowio** functions, the maximum of 2,048 is a hard upper limit for the number of simultaneously open files accessed through the C run-time library.

> [!NOTE]
> This upper limit might be beyond what is supported by a particular Win32 platform and configuration.

## Requirements
