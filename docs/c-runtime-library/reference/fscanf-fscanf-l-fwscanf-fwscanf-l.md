# fscanf, _fscanf_l, fwscanf, _fwscanf_l
Read formatted data from a stream. More secure versions of these functions are available; see [fscanf_s, _fscanf_s_l, fwscanf_s, _fwscanf_s_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/fscanf-s-fscanf-s-l-fwscanf-s-fwscanf-s-l.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
int fscanf(   
   FILE *stream,  
   const char *format [,  
   argument ]...   
);  
int _fscanf_l(   
   FILE *stream,  
   const char *format,  
   locale_t locale [,  
   argument ]...   
);  
int fwscanf(   
   FILE *stream,  
   const wchar_t *format [,  
   argument ]...   
);  
int _fwscanf_l(   
   FILE *stream,  
   const wchar_t *format,  
   locale_t locale [,  
   argument ]...   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `stream`  
 Pointer to `FILE` structure.  
  
 `format`  
 Format-control string.  
  
 `argument`  
 Optional arguments.  
  
 `locale`  
 The locale to use.  
  
## Return Value  
 Each of these functions returns the number of fields successfully converted and assigned; the return value does not include fields that were read but not assigned. A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned. If an error occurs, or if the end of the file stream is reached before the first conversion, the return value is `EOF` for `fscanf` and `fwscanf`.  
  
 These functions validate their parameters. If `stream` or `format` is a null pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return `EOF` and set `errno` to `EINVAL`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `fscanf` function reads data from the current position of `stream` into the locations given by `argument` (if any). Each `argument` must be a pointer to a variable of a type that corresponds to a type specifier in `format`. `format` controls the interpretation of the input fields and has the same form and function as the `format` argument for `scanf`; see [scanf](../../c-runtime-library/reference/scanf-scanf-l-wscanf-wscanf-l.md) for a description of `format`*.*  
  
 `fwscanf` is a wide-character version of `fscanf`; the format argument to `fwscanf` is a wide-character string. These functions behave identically identically if the stream is opened in ANSI mode. `fscanf` doesn't currently support input from a UNICODE stream.  
  
 The versions of these functions with the `_l` suffix are identical except that they use the locale parameter passed in instead of the current thread locale.

## Requirements  
  
|Function|Required header|  
|--------------|---------------------|  
|`fscanf`, `_fscanf_l`|\<stdio.h>|  
|`fwscanf`, `_fwscanf_l`|\<stdio.h> or \<wchar.h>|  
  
 For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// crt_fscanf.c  
// compile with: /W3  
// This program writes formatted  
// data to a file. It then uses fscanf to  
// read the various data back from the file.  
  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
FILE *stream;  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   long l;  
   float fp;  
   char s[81];  
   char c;  
  
   if( fopen_s( &stream, "fscanf.out", "w+" ) != 0 )  
      printf( "The file fscanf.out was not opened\n" );  
   else  
   {  
      fprintf( stream, "%s %ld %f%c", "a-string",   
               65000, 3.14159, 'x' );  
      // Security caution!  
      // Beware loading data from a file without confirming its size,  
      // as it may lead to a buffer overrun situation.  
  
      // Set pointer to beginning of file:  
      fseek( stream, 0L, SEEK_SET );  
  
      // Read data back from file:  
      fscanf( stream, "%s", s );   // C4996  
      fscanf( stream, "%ld", &l ); // C4996  
  
      fscanf( stream, "%f", &fp ); // C4996  
      fscanf( stream, "%c", &c );  // C4996  
      // Note: fscanf is deprecated; consider using fscanf_s instead  
  
      // Output data read:   
      printf( "%s\n", s );  
      printf( "%ld\n", l );  
      printf( "%f\n", fp );  
      printf( "%c\n", c );  
  
      fclose( stream );  
   }  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
a-string  
65000  
3.141590  
x  
```
