# longjmp

Restores the stack environment and execution locale set by a `setjmp` call.

## Syntax

```C
void longjmp(
   jmp_buf env,
   int value
);
```

### Parameters

*env*  
Variable in which environment is stored.

*value*  
Value to be returned to `setjmp` call.

## Remarks

The **longjmp** function restores a stack environment and execution locale previously saved in *env* by `setjmp`. `setjmp` and **longjmp** provide a way to execute a nonlocal **goto**; they are typically used to pass execution control to error-handling or recovery code in a previously called routine without using the normal call and return conventions.

A call to `setjmp` causes the current stack environment to be saved in *env*. A subsequent call to **longjmp** restores the saved environment and returns control to the point immediately following the corresponding `setjmp` call. Execution resumes as if *value* had just been returned by the `setjmp` call. The values of all variables (except register variables) that are accessible to the routine receiving control contain the values they had when **longjmp** was called. The values of register variables are unpredictable. The value returned by `setjmp` must be nonzero. If *value* is passed as 0, the value 1 is substituted in the actual return.

**Microsoft Specific**

In Microsoft C++ code on Windows, **longjmp** uses the same stack-unwinding semantics as exception-handling code. It is safe to use in the same places that C++ exceptions can be raised. However, this usage is not portable, and comes with some important caveats.

Only call **longjmp** before the function that called `setjmp` returns; otherwise the results are unpredictable.

Observe the following restrictions when using **longjmp**:

- Do not assume that the values of the register variables will remain the same. The values of register variables in the routine calling `setjmp` may not be restored to the proper values after **longjmp** is executed.

- Do not use **longjmp** to transfer control out of an interrupt-handling routine unless the interrupt is caused by a floating-point exception. In this case, a program may return from an interrupt handler via **longjmp** if it first reinitializes the floating-point math package by calling [_fpreset](fpreset.md).

- Do not use **longjmp** to transfer control from a callback routine invoked directly or indirectly by Windows code.

- If the code is compiled by using **/EHs** or **/EHsc** and the function that contains the **longjmp** call is **noexcept** then local objects in that function may not be destructed during the stack unwind.

**END Microsoft Specific**

> [!NOTE]  
> In portable C++ code, you can't assume `setjmp` and `longjmp` support C++ object semantics. Specifically, a `setjmp`/`longjmp` call pair has undefined behavior if replacing the `setjmp` and `longjmp` by **catch**
and **throw** would invoke any non-trivial destructors for any automatic objects. In C++ programs, we recommend you use the C++ exception-handling mechanism.
