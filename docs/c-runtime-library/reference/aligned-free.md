# _aligned_free

Frees a block of memory that was allocated with [_aligned_malloc](aligned-malloc.md) or [_aligned_offset_malloc](aligned-offset-malloc.md).

## Syntax

```C
void _aligned_free (
   void *memblock
);
```

### Parameters

*memblock*
A pointer to the memory block that was returned to the `_aligned_malloc` or `_aligned_offset_malloc` function.

## Remarks

**_aligned_free** is marked `__declspec(noalias)`, meaning that the function is guaranteed not to modify global variables. For more information, see [noalias](../../cpp/noalias.md).

This function does not validate its parameter, unlike the other _aligned CRT functions. If *memblock* is a NULL pointer, this function simply performs no actions. It does not change `errno` and it does not invoke the invalid parameter handler. If an error occurs in the function due to not using _aligned functions previously to allocate the block of memory or a misalignment of memory occurs due to some unforeseen calamity, the function generates a debug report from the [_RPT, _RPTF, _RPTW, _RPTFW Macros](rpt-rptf-rptw-rptfw-macros.md).

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**_aligned_free**|\<malloc.h>|

## Example

For more information, see [_aligned_malloc](aligned-malloc.md).
