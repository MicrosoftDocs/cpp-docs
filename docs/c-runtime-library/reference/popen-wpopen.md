# _popen, _wpopen

Creates a pipe and executes a command.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

## Syntax

```C
FILE *_popen(
const char *command,
const char *mode
);
FILE *_wpopen(
const wchar_t *command,
const wchar_t *mode
);
```

### Parameters

*command*<br/>
Command to be executed.

*mode*<br/>
Mode of the returned stream.

## Return Value

Returns a stream associated with one end of the created pipe. The other end of the pipe is associated with the spawned command's standard input or standard output. The functions return **NULL** on an error. If the error is an invalid parameter, such as if *command* or *mode* is a null pointer, or *mode* is not a valid mode, **errno** is set to **EINVAL**. See the Remarks section for valid modes.

For information about these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Remarks

The **_popen** function creates a pipe and asynchronously executes a spawned copy of the command processor with the specified string *command*. The character string *mode* specifies the type of access requested, as follows.

**"r"**
The calling process can read the spawned command's standard output using the returned stream.

**"w"**
The calling process can write to the spawned command's standard input using the returned stream.

**"b"**
Open in binary mode.

**"t"**
Open in text mode.

> [!NOTE]
> If used in a Windows program, the **_popen** function returns an invalid file pointer that causes the program to stop responding indefinitely. **_popen** works properly in a console application. To create a Windows application that redirects input and output, see [Creating a Child Process with Redirected Input and Output](/windows/desktop/ProcThread/creating-a-child-process-with-redirected-input-and-output) in the Windows SDK.

**_wpopen** is a wide-character version of **_popen**; the *path* argument to **_wpopen** is a wide-character string. **_wpopen** and **_popen** behave identically otherwise.

### Generic-Text Routine Mappings

|Tchar.h routine|_UNICODE and _MBCS not defined|_MBCS defined|_UNICODE defined|
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
|**_tpopen**|**_popen**|**_popen**|**_wpopen**|

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**_popen**|\<stdio.h>|
|**_wpopen**|\<stdio.h> or \<wchar.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_popen.c
/* This program uses _popen and _pclose to receive a
* stream of text from a system process.
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main( void )
{

   char   psBuffer[128];
   FILE   *pPipe;

        /* Run DIR so that it writes its output to a pipe. Open this
         * pipe with read text attribute so that we can read it
         * like a text file.
         */

   if( (pPipe = _popen( "dir *.c /on /p", "rt" )) == NULL )
      exit( 1 );

   /* Read pipe until end of file, or an error occurs. */

   while(fgets(psBuffer, 128, pPipe))
   {
      printf(psBuffer);
   }

   /* Close pipe and print return value of pPipe. */
   if (feof( pPipe))
   {
     printf( "\nProcess returned %d\n", _pclose( pPipe ) );
   }
   else
   {
     printf( "Error: Failed to read the pipe to the end.\n");
   }
}
```

### Sample Output

This output assumes that there is only one file in the current directory with a .c file name extension.

```Output
 Volume in drive C is CDRIVE
 Volume Serial Number is 0E17-1702

Directory of D:\proj\console\test1

 07/17/98  07:26p                   780 popen.c
               1 File(s)            780 bytes
                             86,597,632 bytes free
