# _spawnlp, _wspawnlp

Creates and executes a new process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

## Syntax

```C
intptr_t _spawnlp(
   int mode,
   const char *cmdname,
   const char *arg0,
   const char *arg1,
   ... const char *argn,
   NULL
);
intptr_t _wspawnlp(
   int mode,
   const wchar_t *cmdname,
   const wchar_t *arg0,
   const wchar_t *arg1,
   ... const wchar_t *argn,
   NULL
);
```

### Parameters

*mode*<br/>
Execution mode for the calling process.

*cmdname*<br/>
Path of the file to be executed.

*arg0*, *arg1*, ... *argn*<br/>
List of pointers to arguments. The *arg0* argument is usually a pointer to *cmdname*. The arguments *arg1* through *argn* are pointers to the character strings forming the new argument list. Following *argn*, there must be a **NULL** pointer to mark the end of the argument list.

## Return Value

The return value from a synchronous **_spawnlp** or **_wspawnlp** (**_P_WAIT** specified for *mode*) is the exit status of the new process. The return value from an asynchronous **_spawnlp** or **_wspawnlp** (**_P_NOWAIT** or **_P_NOWAITO** specified for *mode*) is the process handle. The exit status is 0 if the process terminated normally. You can set the exit status to a nonzero value if the spawned process specifically calls the **exit** routine with a nonzero argument. If the new process did not explicitly set a positive exit status, a positive exit status indicates an abnormal exit with an abort or an interrupt. A return value of -1 indicates an error (the new process is not started). In this case, **errno** is set to one of the following values.

|||
|-|-|
**E2BIG**|Argument list exceeds 1024 bytes.
**EINVAL**|*mode* argument is invalid.
**ENOENT**|File or path is not found.
**ENOEXEC**|Specified file is not executable or has invalid executable-file format.
**ENOMEM**|Not enough memory is available to execute the new process.

For more information about these and other return codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Remarks

Each of these functions creates and executes a new process, passing each command-line argument as a separate parameter and using the **PATH** environment variable to find the file to execute.

These functions validate their parameters. If either *cmdname* or *arg0* is an empty string or a null pointer, these functions generate an invalid parameter exception, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions set **errno** to **EINVAL**, and return -1. No new process is spawned.

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**_spawnlp**|\<process.h>|
|**_wspawnlp**|\<stdio.h> or \<wchar.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).
