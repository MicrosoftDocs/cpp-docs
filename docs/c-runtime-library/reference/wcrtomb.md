# wcrtomb

Convert a wide character into its multibyte character representation. A more secure version of this function is available; see [wcrtomb_s](wcrtomb-s.md).

## Syntax

```C
size_t wcrtomb(
   char *mbchar,
   wchar_t wchar,
   mbstate_t *mbstate
);
template <size_t size>
size_t wcrtomb(
   char (&mbchar)[size],
   wchar_t wchar,
   mbstate_t *mbstate
); // C++ only
```

### Parameters

*mbchar*<br/>
The resulting multibyte converted character.

*wchar*<br/>
A wide character to convert.

*mbstate*<br/>
A pointer to an **mbstate_t** object.

## Return Value

Returns the number of bytes required to represent the converted multibyte character, otherwise a -1 if an error occurs.

## Remarks

The **wcrtomb** function converts a wide character, beginning in the specified conversion state contained in *mbstate*, from the value contained in *wchar*, into the address represented by *mbchar*. The return value is the number of bytes required to represent the corresponding multibyte character, but it will not return more than **MB_CUR_MAX** bytes.

If *mbstate* is null, the internal **mbstate_t** object containing the conversion state of *mbchar* is used. If the character sequence *wchar* does not have a corresponding multibyte character representation, a -1 is returned and the **errno** is set to **EILSEQ**.

The **wcrtomb** function differs from [wctomb, _wctomb_l](wctomb-wctomb-l.md) by its restartability. The conversion state is stored in *mbstate* for subsequent calls to the same or other restartable functions. Results are undefined when mixing the use of restartable and nonrestartable functions. For example, an application would use **wcsrlen** rather than **wcsnlen**, if a subsequent call to **wcsrtombs** were used instead of **wcstombs**.

In C++, this function has a template overload that invokes the newer, secure counterparts of this function. For more information, see [Secure Template Overloads](../../c-runtime-library/secure-template-overloads.md).

## Exceptions

The **wcrtomb** function is multithread safe as long as no function in the current thread calls **setlocale** while this function is executing and while the *mbstate* is null.

## Example

```C
// crt_wcrtomb.c
// compile with: /W3
// This program converts a wide character
// to its corresponding multibyte character.

#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

int main( void )
{
    size_t      sizeOfCovertion = 0;
    mbstate_t   mbstate;
    char        mbStr = 0;
    wchar_t*    wcStr = L"Q";

    // Reset to initial conversion state
    memset(&mbstate, 0, sizeof(mbstate));

    sizeOfCovertion = wcrtomb(&mbStr, *wcStr, &mbstate); // C4996
    // Note: wcrtomb is deprecated; consider using wcrtomb_s instead
    if (sizeOfCovertion > 0)
    {
        printf("The corresponding wide character \"");
        wprintf(L"%s\"", wcStr);
        printf(" was converted to the \"%c\" ", mbStr);
        printf("multibyte character.\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("No corresponding multibyte character "
               "was found.\n");
    }
}
```

```Output
The corresponding wide character "Q" was converted to the "Q" multibyte character.
```
