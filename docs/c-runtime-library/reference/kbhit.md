# _kbhit
Checks the console for keyboard input.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported with /ZW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj606124.aspx).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
int _kbhit( void );  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 `_kbhit` returns a nonzero value if a key has been pressed. Otherwise, it returns 0.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `_kbhit` function checks the console for a recent keystroke. If the function returns a nonzero value, a keystroke is waiting in the buffer. The program can then call `_getch` or `_getche` to get the keystroke.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Routine|Required header|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|`_kbhit`|\<conio.h>|  
  
 For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).  
  
## Libraries  
 All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// crt_kbhit.c  
// compile with: /c  
/* This program loops until the user  
 * presses a key. If _kbhit returns nonzero, a  
 * keystroke is waiting in the buffer. The program  
 * can call _getch or _getche to get the keystroke.  
 */  
  
#include <conio.h>  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   /* Display message until key is pressed. */  
   while( !_kbhit() )  
      _cputs( "Hit me!! " );  
  
   /* Use _getch to throw key away. */  
   printf( "\nKey struck was '%c'\n", _getch() );  
}  
```  
  
## Sample Output  
  
```  
Hit me!! Hit me!! Hit me!! Hit me!! Hit me!! Hit me!! Hit me!!  
Key struck was 'q'   
```
