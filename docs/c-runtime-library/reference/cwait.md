# `_cwait`

Waits until another process terminates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

## Syntax

```C
intptr_t _cwait(
   int *termstat,
   intptr_t procHandle,
   int action
);
```

### Parameters

*`termstat`*\
Pointer to a buffer where the result code of the specified process will be stored, or `NULL`.

*`procHandle`*\
The handle to the process to wait on (that is, the process that has to terminate before **`_cwait`** can return).

*`action`*\
`NULL`: Ignored by Windows operating system applications; for other applications: action code to perform on *`procHandle`*.

## Return value

When the specified process has successfully completed, returns the handle of the specified process and sets *`termstat`* to the result code that's returned by the specified process. Otherwise, returns -1 and sets `errno` as follows.

| `errno` value | Description |
|---|---|
| `ECHILD` | No specified process exists, *`procHandle`* is invalid, or the call to the [`GetExitCodeProcess`](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getexitcodeprocess) or [`WaitForSingleObject`](/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitforsingleobject) API failed. |
| `EINVAL` | *`action`* is invalid. |

For more information about these and other return codes, see [`errno`, `_doserrno`, `_sys_errlist`, and `_sys_nerr`](../errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Remarks

The **`_cwait`** function waits for the termination of the process ID of the specified process that's provided by *`procHandle`*. The value of *`procHandle`* that's passed to **`_cwait`** should be the value that's returned by the call to the [`_spawn`](../spawn-wspawn-functions.md) function that created the specified process. If the process ID terminates before **`_cwait`** is called, **`_cwait`** returns immediately. **`_cwait`** can be used by any process to wait for any other known process for which a valid handle (*`procHandle`*) exists.

*`termstat`* points to a buffer where the return code of the specified process will be stored. The value of *`termstat`* indicates whether the specified process terminated normally by calling the Windows [`ExitProcess`](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-exitprocess) API. `ExitProcess` is called internally if the specified process calls **`exit`** or **`_exit`**, returns from **`main`**, or reaches the end of **`main`**. For more information about the value that's passed back through *`termstat`*, see [`GetExitCodeProcess`](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getexitcodeprocess). If **`_cwait`** is called by using a `NULL` value for *`termstat`*, the return code of the specified process isn't stored.

The *`action`* parameter is ignored by the Windows operating system because parent-child relationships aren't implemented in these environments.

Unless *`procHandle`* is -1 or -2 (handles to the current process or thread), the handle will be closed. In this situation, don't use the returned handle.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

## Requirements

| Routine | Required header | Optional header |
|---|---|---|
| **`_cwait`** | \<process.h> | \<errno.h> |

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../compatibility.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_cwait.c
// This program launches several processes and waits
// for a specified process to finish.

#define _CRT_RAND_S

#include <windows.h>
#include <process.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

// Macro to get a random integer within a specified range
#define getrandom( min, max ) (( (rand_s (&number), number) % (int)((( max ) + 1 ) - ( min ))) + ( min ))

struct PROCESS
{
    intptr_t hProcess;
    char    name[40];
} process[4] = { { 0, "Ann" }, { 0, "Beth" }, { 0, "Carl" }, { 0, "Dave" } };

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int termstat, c;
    unsigned int number;

    srand((unsigned)time(NULL));    // Seed randomizer

    // If no arguments, this is the calling process
    if (argc == 1)
    {
        // Spawn processes in numeric order
        for (c = 0; c < 4; c++) {
            _flushall();
            process[c].hProcess = _spawnl(_P_NOWAIT, argv[0], argv[0],
                process[c].name, NULL);
        }

        // Wait for randomly specified process, and respond when done
        c = getrandom(0, 3);
        printf("Come here, %s.\n", process[c].name);
        _cwait(&termstat, process[c].hProcess, _WAIT_CHILD);
        printf("Thank you, %s.\n", process[c].name);

    }
    // If there are arguments, this must be a spawned process
    else
    {
        // Delay for a period that's determined by process number
        Sleep((argv[1][0] - 'A' + 1) * 1000L);
        printf("Hi, Dad. It's %s.\n", argv[1]);
    }
}
```

The order of the output varies from run to run.

```Output
Hi, Dad. It's Ann.
Come here, Ann.
Thank you, Ann.
Hi, Dad. It's Beth.
Hi, Dad. It's Carl.
Hi, Dad. It's Dave.
```
