# _aligned_msize_dbg

Returns the size of a memory block allocated in the heap (debug version only).

## Syntax

```C
size_t _aligned_msize_dbg(
   void *memblock,
   size_t alignment,
   size_t offset
);
```

### Parameters

*memblock*<br/>
Pointer to the memory block.

*alignment*<br/>
The alignment value, which must be an integer power of 2.

*offset*<br/>
The offset into the memory allocation to force the alignment.

## Return Value

Returns the size (in bytes) as an unsigned integer.

## Remarks

The *alignment* and *offset* values must be the same as the values passed to the function that allocated the block.

**_aligned_msize_dbg** is a debug version of the [_aligned_msize](aligned-msize.md) function. When [_DEBUG](../../c-runtime-library/debug.md) is not defined, each call to **_aligned_msize_dbg** is reduced to a call to **_aligned_msize**. Both **_aligned_msize** and **_aligned_msize_dbg** calculate the size of a memory block in the base heap, but **_aligned_msize_dbg** adds a debugging feature: It includes the buffers on either side of the user portion of the memory block in the returned size.

This function validates its parameter. If *memblock* is a null pointer or *alignment* is not a power of 2, **_msize** invokes an invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If the error is handled, the function sets **errno** to **EINVAL** and returns -1.

For information about how memory blocks are allocated, initialized, and managed in the debug version of the base heap, see [CRT Debug Heap Details](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debug-heap-details). For information about the allocation block types and how they are used, see [Types of blocks on the debug heap](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debug-heap-details). For information about the differences between calling a standard heap function and its debug version in a debug build of an application, see [Debug Versions of Heap Allocation Functions](/visualstudio/debugger/debug-versions-of-heap-allocation-functions).
