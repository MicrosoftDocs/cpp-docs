# _fullpath_dbg, _wfullpath_dbg

Versions of [_fullpath, _wfullpath](fullpath-wfullpath.md) that use the debug version of **malloc** to allocate memory.

## Syntax

```C
char *_fullpath_dbg(
   char *absPath,
   const char *relPath,
   size_t maxLength,
   int blockType,
   const char *filename,
   int linenumber
);
wchar_t *_wfullpath_dbg(
   wchar_t *absPath,
   const wchar_t *relPath,
   size_t maxLength,
   int blockType,
   const char *filename,
   int linenumber
);
```

### Parameters

*absPath*<br/>
Pointer to a buffer containing the absolute or full path name, or **NULL**.

*relPath*<br/>
Relative path name.

*maxLength*<br/>
Maximum length of the absolute path name buffer (*absPath*). This length is in bytes for **_fullpath** but in wide characters (**wchar_t**) for **_wfullpath**.

*blockType*<br/>
Requested type of memory block: **_CLIENT_BLOCK** or **_NORMAL_BLOCK**.

*filename*<br/>
Pointer to the name of the source file that requested allocation operation or **NULL**.

*linenumber*<br/>
Line number in the source file where the allocation operation was requested or **NULL**.

## Return Value

Each function returns a pointer to a buffer containing the absolute path name (*absPath*). If there is an error (for example, if the value passed in *relPath* includes a drive letter that is not valid or cannot be found, or if the length of the created absolute path name (*absPath*) is greater than *maxLength*) the function returns **NULL**.

## Remarks

The **_fullpath_dbg** and **_wfullpath_dbg** functions are identical to **_fullpath** and **_wfullpath** except that, when **_DEBUG** is defined, these functions use the debug version of **malloc**, **_malloc_dbg**, to allocate memory if **NULL** is passed as the first parameter. For information on the debugging features of **_malloc_dbg**, see [_malloc_dbg](malloc-dbg.md).

You do not need to call these functions explicitly in most cases. Instead, you can define the **_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC** flag. When **_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC** is defined, calls to **_fullpath** and **_wfullpath** are remapped to **_fullpath_dbg** and **_wfullpath_dbg**, respectively, with the *blockType* set to **_NORMAL_BLOCK**. Thus, you do not need to call these functions explicitly unless you want to mark the heap blocks as **_CLIENT_BLOCK**. For more information, see [Types of blocks on the debug heap](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debug-heap-details).
