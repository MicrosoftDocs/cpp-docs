# fegetround, fesetround

Gets or sets the current floating-point rounding mode.

## Syntax

```C
int fegetround(void);

int fesetround(
   int round_mode
);
```

### Parameters

*round_mode*<br/>
The rounding mode to set, as one of the floating-point rounding macros. If the value is not equal to one of the floating-point rounding macros, the rounding mode is not changed.

## Return Value

On success, **fegetround** returns the rounding mode as one of the floating point rounding macro values. It returns a negative value if the current rounding mode can't be determined.

On success, **fesetround** returns 0. Otherwise, a non-zero value is returned.

## Remarks

Floating-point operations can use one of several rounding modes. These control which direction the results of floating-point operations are rounded toward when the results are stored. These are the names and behaviors of the floating-point rounding macros defined in \<fenv.h>:

|Macro|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|FE_DOWNWARD|Round towards negative infinity.|
|FE_TONEAREST|Round towards the nearest.|
|FE_TOWARDZERO|Round towards zero.|
|FE_UPWARD|Round towards positive infinity.|

The default behavior of FE_TONEAREST is to round results midway between representable values toward the nearest value with an even (0) least significant bit.

The current rounding mode affects these operations:

- String conversions.

- The results of floating-point arithmetic operators outside of constant expressions.

- The library rounding functions, such as **rint** and **nearbyint**.

- Return values from standard library mathematical functions.

The current rounding mode does not affect these operations:

- The **trunc**, **ceil**, **floor**, and **lround** library functions.

- Floating-point to integer implicit casts and conversions, which always round towards zero.

- The results of floating-point arithmetic operators in constant expressions, which always round to the nearest value.

To use these functions, you must turn off floating-point optimizations that could prevent access by using the `#pragma fenv_access(on)` directive prior to the call. For more information, see [fenv_access](../../preprocessor/fenv-access.md).

## Requirements

|Function|C header|C++ header|
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
|**fegetround**, **fesetround**|\<fenv.h>|\<cfenv>|

For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).
