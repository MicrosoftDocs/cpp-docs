# _ftime_s, _ftime32_s, _ftime64_s

Gets the current time. These are versions of [_ftime, _ftime32, _ftime64](ftime-ftime32-ftime64.md) with security enhancements as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).

## Syntax

```C
errno_t _ftime_s( struct _timeb *timeptr );
errno_t _ftime32_s( struct __timeb32 *timeptr );
errno_t _ftime64_s( struct __timeb64 *timeptr );
```

### Parameters

*timeptr*<br/>
Pointer to a **_timeb**, **__timeb32**, or **__timeb64** structure.

## Return Value

Zero if successful, an error code on failure. If *timeptr* is **NULL**, the return value is **EINVAL**.

## Remarks

The **_ftime_s** function gets the current local time and stores it in the structure pointed to by *timeptr*. The **_timeb**, **__timeb32**, and **__timeb64** structures are defined in SYS\Timeb.h. They contain four fields, which are listed in the following table.

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
|**dstflag**|Nonzero if daylight savings time is currently in effect for the local time zone. (See [_tzset](tzset.md) for an explanation of how daylight savings time is determined.)|
|**millitm**|Fraction of a second in milliseconds.|
|**time**|Time in seconds since midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970, coordinated universal time (UTC).|
|**timezone**|Difference in minutes, moving westward, between UTC and local time. The value of **timezone** is set from the value of the global variable **_timezone** (see **_tzset**).|

The **_ftime64_s** function, which uses the **__timeb64** structure, allows file-creation dates to be expressed up through 23:59:59, December 31, 3000, UTC; whereas **_ftime32_s** only represents dates through 23:59:59 January 18, 2038, UTC. Midnight, January 1, 1970, is the lower bound of the date range for all these functions.

The **_ftime_s** function is equivalent to **_ftime64_s**, and **_timeb** contains a 64-bit time, unless **_USE_32BIT_TIME_T** is defined, in which case the old behavior is in effect; **_ftime_s** uses a 32-bit time and **_timeb** contains a 32-bit time.

**_ftime_s** validates its parameters. If passed a null pointer as *timeptr*, the function invokes the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, the function sets **errno** to **EINVAL**.

## Requirements

|Function|Required header|
|--------------|---------------------|
|**_ftime_s**|\<sys/types.h> and \<sys/timeb.h>|
|**_ftime32_s**|\<sys/types.h> and \<sys/timeb.h>|
|**_ftime64_s**|\<sys/types.h> and \<sys/timeb.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_ftime64_s.c
// This program uses _ftime64_s to obtain the current
// time and then stores this time in timebuffer.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/timeb.h>
#include <time.h>

int main( void )
{
   struct _timeb timebuffer;
   char timeline[26];
   errno_t err;
   time_t time1;
   unsigned short millitm1;
   short timezone1;
   short dstflag1;

   _ftime64_s( &timebuffer );

    time1 = timebuffer.time;
    millitm1 = timebuffer.millitm;
    timezone1 = timebuffer.timezone;
    dstflag1 = timebuffer.dstflag;

   printf( "Seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 (UTC): %I64d\n",
   time1);
   printf( "Milliseconds: %d\n", millitm1);
   printf( "Minutes between UTC and local time: %d\n", timezone1);
   printf( "Daylight savings time flag (1 means Daylight time is in "
           "effect): %d\n", dstflag1);

   err = ctime_s( timeline, 26, & ( timebuffer.time ) );
   if (err)
   {
       printf("Invalid argument to ctime_s. ");
   }
   printf( "The time is %.19s.%hu %s", timeline, timebuffer.millitm,
           &timeline[20] );
}
```

```Output
Seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 (UTC): 1051553334
Milliseconds: 230
Minutes between UTC and local time: 480
Daylight savings time flag (1 means Daylight time is in effect): 1
The time is Mon Apr 28 11:08:54.230 2003
```
