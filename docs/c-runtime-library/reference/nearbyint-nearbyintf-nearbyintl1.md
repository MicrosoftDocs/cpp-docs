# `nearbyint`, `nearbyintf`, `nearbyintl`

Rounds the specified floating-point value to an integer, and returns that value in a floating-point format.

## Syntax

```C
double nearbyint( double x );
float nearbyintf( float x );
long double nearbyintl( long double x );
#define nearbyint( X ) // Requires C11 or later

float nearbyint( float x ); //C++ only
long double nearbyint( long double x ); //C++ only
```

### Parameters

*`x`*\
The value to round.

## Return value

If successful, returns *`x`*, rounded to the nearest integer, using the current rounding format as reported by [`fegetround`](fegetround-fesetround2.md). Otherwise, the function may return one of the following values:

| Issue | Return |
|---|---|
| *`x`* = ±INFINITY | ±INFINITY, unmodified |
| *`x`* = ±0 | ±0, unmodified |
| *`x`* = NaN | NaN |

Errors aren't reported through [`_matherr`](matherr.md); specifically, this function doesn't report any `FE_INEXACT` exceptions.

## Remarks

The primary difference between this function and [`rint`](rint-rintf-rintl.md) is that this function doesn't raise the inexact floating point exception.

Because the maximum floating-point values are exact integers, this function will never overflow by itself; rather, the output may overflow the return value, depending on which version of the function you use.

C++ allows overloading, so you can call overloads of **`nearbyint`** that take and return **`float`** or **`long double`** parameters. In a C program, unless you're using the \<tgmath.h> macro to call this function, **`nearbyint`** always takes two double values and returns a double value.

If you use the \<tgmath.h> `nearbyint()` macro, the type of the argument determines which version of the function is selected. See [Type-generic math](../tgmath.md) for details.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

## Requirements

| Function | C header | C++ header |
|---|---|---|
| **`nearbyint`**, **`nearbyintf`**, **`nearbyintl`** | \<math.h> | \<cmath> or \<math.h> |
| **`nearbyint`** macro | \<tgmath.h> |  |
