# `_futime`, `_futime32`, `_futime64`

Sets the modification time on an open file.

## Syntax

```C
int _futime( // See note in remarks section about linkage
   int fd,
   struct _utimbuf *filetime
);
int _futime32(
   int fd,
   struct __utimbuf32 *filetime
);
int _futime64(
   int fd,
   struct __utimbuf64 *filetime
);
```

### Parameters

*`fd`*\
File descriptor to the open file.

*`filetime`*\
Pointer to the structure containing the new modification date.

## Return value

Return 0 if successful. If an error occurs, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter validation](../parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, the function returns -1 and `errno` is set to `EBADF`, indicating an invalid file descriptor, or `EINVAL`, indicating an invalid parameter.

## Remarks

The **`_futime`** routine sets the modification date and the access time on the open file associated with *`fd`*. **`_futime`** is identical to [`_utime`](utime-utime32-utime64-wutime-wutime32-wutime64.md), except that its argument is the file descriptor of an open file, rather than the name of a file or a path to a file. The `_utimbuf` structure contains fields for the new modification date and access time. Both fields must contain valid values. `_utimbuf32` and `_utimbuf64` are identical to `_utimbuf` except for the use of the 32-bit and 64-bit time types, respectively. **`_futime`** and `_utimbuf` use a 64-bit time type and **`_futime`** is identical in behavior to **`_futime64`**. If you need to force the old behavior, define `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T`. Doing this causes **`_futime`** to be identical in behavior to **`_futime32`** and causes the `_utimbuf` structure to use the 32-bit time type, making it equivalent to `__utimbuf32`.

**`_futime64`**, which uses the `__utimbuf64` structure, can read and modify file dates through 23:59:59, December 31, 3000, UTC; whereas a call to **`_futime32`** fails if the date on the file is later than 23:59:59 January 18, 2038, UTC. Midnight, January 1, 1970, is the lower bound of the date range for these functions.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

> [!Note]
> If you use Windows SDK version 10.0.xxxxx.xxxx and Visual Studio 2026 or later together, the following functions are no longer declared as `static inline` (internal linkage). Instead, they are declared as `inline` (external linkage).\
> To return to the previous behavior, `#define _STATIC_INLINE_UCRT_FUNCTIONS=1` before including any CRT headers. By default, `_STATIC_INLINE_UCRT_FUNCTIONS` is set to 0.\
> This change increases UCRT conformance with the C++ standard, while also improving compatibility with C++ modules.\
> This applies to the following function: `_futime`

## Requirements

| Function | Required header | Optional header |
|---|---|---|
| **`_futime`** | \<sys/utime.h> | \<errno.h> |
| **`_futime32`** | \<sys/utime.h> | \<errno.h> |
| **`_futime64`** | \<sys/utime.h> | \<errno.h> |

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../compatibility.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_futime.c
// This program uses _futime to set the
// file-modification time to the current time.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <io.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/utime.h>
#include <share.h>

int main( void )
{
   int hFile;

   // Show file time before and after.
   system( "dir crt_futime.c_input" );

   _sopen_s( &hFile, "crt_futime.c_input", _O_RDWR, _SH_DENYNO, 0 );

   if( _futime( hFile, NULL ) == -1 )
      perror( "_futime failed\n" );
   else
      printf( "File time modified\n" );

   _close (hFile);

   system( "dir crt_futime.c_input" );
}
```
