# _lseek, _lseeki64

Moves a file pointer to the specified location.

## Syntax

```C
long _lseek(
   int fd,
   long offset,
   int origin
);
__int64 _lseeki64(
   int fd,
   __int64 offset,
   int origin
);
```

### Parameters

*fd*<br/>
File descriptor referring to an open file.

*offset*<br/>
Number of bytes from *origin*.

*origin*<br/>
Initial position.

## Return Value

**_lseek** returns the offset, in bytes, of the new position from the beginning of the file. **_lseeki64** returns the offset in a 64-bit integer. The function returns -1L to indicate an error. If passed an invalid parameter, such as a bad file descriptor, or the value for *origin* is invalid or the position specified by *offset* is before the beginning of the file, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions set **errno** to **EBADF** and return -1L. On devices incapable of seeking (such as terminals and printers), the return value is undefined.

For more information about these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Remarks

The **_lseek** function moves the file pointer associated with *fd* to a new location that is *offset* bytes from *origin*. The next operation on the file occurs at the new location. The *origin* argument must be one of the following constants, which are defined in Stdio.h.

|*origin* value||
|-|-|
**SEEK_SET**|Beginning of the file.
**SEEK_CUR**|Current position of the file pointer.
**SEEK_END**|End of file.

You can use **_lseek** to reposition the pointer anywhere in a file or beyond the end of the file.

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**_lseek**|\<io.h>|
|**_lseeki64**|\<io.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_lseek.c
/* This program first opens a file named lseek.txt.
* It then uses _lseek to find the beginning of the file,
* to find the current position in the file, and to find
* the end of the file.
*/

#include <io.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <share.h>

int main( void )
{
   int fh;
   long pos;               /* Position of file pointer */
   char buffer[10];

   _sopen_s( &fh, "crt_lseek.c_input", _O_RDONLY, _SH_DENYNO, 0 );

   /* Seek the beginning of the file: */
   pos = _lseek( fh, 0L, SEEK_SET );
   if( pos == -1L )
      perror( "_lseek to beginning failed" );
   else
      printf( "Position for beginning of file seek = %ld\n", pos );

   /* Move file pointer a little */
    _read( fh, buffer, 10 );

   /* Find current position: */
   pos = _lseek( fh, 0L, SEEK_CUR );
   if( pos == -1L )
      perror( "_lseek to current position failed" );
   else
      printf( "Position for current position seek = %ld\n", pos );

   /* Set the end of the file: */
   pos = _lseek( fh, 0L, SEEK_END );
   if( pos == -1L )
      perror( "_lseek to end failed" );
   else
      printf( "Position for end of file seek = %ld\n", pos );

   _close( fh );
}
```

### Input: crt_lseek.c_input

```Input
Line one.
Line two.
Line three.
Line four.
Line five.
```

### Output

```Output
Position for beginning of file seek = 0
Position for current position seek = 10
Position for end of file seek = 57
```
