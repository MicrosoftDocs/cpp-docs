# quick_exit

Causes normal program termination to occur.

## Syntax

```C
__declspec(noreturn) void quick_exit(
    int status
);
```

### Parameters

*status*<br/>
The status code to return to the host environment.

## Return Value

The **quick_exit** function cannot return to its caller.

## Remarks

The **quick_exit** function causes normal program termination. It calls no functions registered by **atexit**, **_onexit** or signal handlers registered by the **signal** function. Behavior is undefined if **quick_exit** is called more than once, or if the **exit** function is also called.

The **quick_exit** function calls, in last-in, first-out (LIFO) order, the functions registered by **at_quick_exit**, except for those functions already called when the function was registered.  Behavior is undefined if a [longjmp](longjmp.md) call is made during a call to a registered function that would terminate the call to the  function.

After the registered functions have been called, **quick_exit** invokes **_Exit** by using the *status* value to return control to the host environment.

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**quick_exit**|\<process.h> or \<stdlib.h>|
