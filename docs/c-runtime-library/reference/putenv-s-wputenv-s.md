# `_putenv_s`, `_wputenv_s`, `_tputenv_s`

Creates, modifies, or removes environment variables. These functions are versions of [`_putenv`, `_wputenv`](putenv-wputenv.md) that have security enhancements, as described in [Security features in the CRT](../security-features-in-the-crt.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

For `_tputenv_s`, see [Generic-text function mappings](#generic-text-function-mappings).

## Syntax

```C
errno_t _putenv_s(
   const char *varname,
   const char *value_string
);
errno_t _wputenv_s(
   const wchar_t *varname,
   const wchar_t *value_string
);
```

### Parameters

*`varname`*\
The environment variable name.

*`value_string`*\
The value to set the environment variable to.

## Return value

Returns 0 if successful, or an error code.

### Error conditions

| *`varname`* | *`value_string`* | Return value |
|---|---|---|
| `NULL` | any | `EINVAL` |
| any | `NULL` | `EINVAL` |

If one of the error conditions occurs, these functions invoke an invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter validation](../parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return `EINVAL` and set `errno` to `EINVAL`.

## Remarks

The **`_putenv_s`** function adds new environment variables or modifies the values of existing environment variables. Environment variables define the environment in which a process executes (for example, the default search path for libraries to be linked with a program). **`_wputenv_s`** is a wide-character version of **`_putenv_s`**; the *`envstring`* argument to **`_wputenv_s`** is a wide-character string.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

### Generic-text function mappings

The function in the `tchar.h` column maps to the function in the other columns depending on the character set that is defined at compile time.

| `tchar.h` function | `_UNICODE` and `_MBCS` not defined | `_MBCS` defined | `_UNICODE` defined |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_tputenv_s` | `_putenv_s` | `_putenv_s` | `_wputenv_s` |

*`varname`* is the name of the environment variable to be added or modified and *`value_string`* is the variable's value. If *`varname`* is already part of the environment, its value is replaced by *`value_string`*; otherwise, the new *`varname`* variable and its *`value_string`* are added to the environment. You can remove a variable from the environment by specifying an empty string (that is, `""`) for *`value_string`*.

**`_putenv_s`** and **`_wputenv_s`** affect only the environment that is local to the current process; you can't use them to modify the command-level environment. These functions operate only on data structures that are accessible to the run-time library and not on the environment "segment" that the operating system creates for a process. When the current process terminates, the environment reverts to the level of the calling process, which in most cases is the operating-system level. However, the modified environment can be passed to any new processes that are created by **`_spawn`**, **`_exec`**, or **`system`**, and these new processes get any new items that are added by **`_putenv_s`** and **`_wputenv_s`**.

Don't change an environment entry directly; instead, use **`_putenv_s`** or **`_wputenv_s`** to change it. In particular, directly freeing elements of the **`_environ[]`** global array might cause invalid memory to be addressed.

**`getenv`** and **`_putenv_s`** use the global variable **`_environ`** to access the environment table; **`_wgetenv`** and **`_wputenv_s`** use **`_wenviron`**. **`_putenv_s`** and **`_wputenv_s`** may change the value of **`_environ`** and **`_wenviron`**, and thereby invalidate the *`envp`* argument to **`main`** and the **`_wenvp`** argument to **`wmain`**. Therefore, it's safer to use **`_environ`** or **`_wenviron`** to access the environment information. For more information about the relationship of **`_putenv_s`** and **`_wputenv_s`** to global variables, see [`_environ`, `_wenviron`](../environ-wenviron.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The **`_putenv_s`** and **`_getenv_s`** families of functions are not thread-safe. **`_getenv_s`** could return a string pointer while **`_putenv_s`** is modifying the string, and thereby cause random failures. Make sure that calls to these functions are synchronized.

## Requirements

| Routine | Required header |
|---|---|
| **`_putenv_s`** | `<stdlib.h>` |
| **`_wputenv_s`** | `<stdlib.h>` or `<wchar.h>` |

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../compatibility.md).

## Example

For a sample that shows how to use **`_putenv_s`**, see [`getenv_s`, `_wgetenv_s`](getenv-s-wgetenv-s.md).
