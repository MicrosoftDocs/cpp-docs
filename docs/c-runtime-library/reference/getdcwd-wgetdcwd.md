# _getdcwd, _wgetdcwd

Gets the full path of the current working directory on the specified drive.

## Syntax

```C
char *_getdcwd(
   int drive,
   char *buffer,
   int maxlen
);
wchar_t *_wgetdcwd(
   int drive,
   wchar_t *buffer,
   int maxlen
);
```

### Parameters

*drive*<br/>
A non-negative integer that specifies the drive (0 = default drive, 1 = A, 2 = B, and so on).

If the specified drive is not available, or the kind of drive (for example, removable, fixed, CD-ROM, RAM disk, or network drive) cannot be determined, the invalid-parameter handler, which is described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md), is invoked.

*buffer*<br/>
Storage location for the path, or **NULL**.

If **NULL** is specified, this function allocates a buffer of at least *maxlen* size by using **malloc**, and the return value of **_getdcwd** is a pointer to the allocated buffer. The buffer can be freed by calling **free** and passing it the pointer.

*maxlen*<br/>
A nonzero positive integer that specifies the maximum length of the path, in characters: **char** for **_getdcwd** and **wchar_t** for **_wgetdcwd**.

If *maxlen* is not greater than zero, the invalid-parameter handler, which is described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md), is invoked.

## Return Value

Pointer to a string that represents the full path of the current working directory on the specified drive, or **NULL**, which indicates an error.

If *buffer* is specified as **NULL** and there is insufficient memory to allocate *maxlen* characters, an error occurs and **errno** is set to **ENOMEM**. If the length of the path,  which includes the terminating null character, exceeds *maxlen*, an error occurs and **errno** is set to **ERANGE**. For more information about these error codes, see [errno, _doserrno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Remarks

The **_getdcwd** function gets the full path of the current working directory on the specified drive and stores it at *buffer*. If the current working directory is set to the root, the string ends with a backslash (\\). If the current working directory is set to a directory other than the root, the string ends with the name of the directory and not with a backslash.

**_wgetdcwd** is a wide-character version of **_getdcwd**, and its *buffer* parameter and return value are wide-character strings. Otherwise, **_wgetdcwd** and **_getdcwd** behave identically.

This function is thread-safe even though it depends on **GetFullPathName**, which is itself not thread-safe. However, you can violate thread safety if your multithreaded application calls both this function and [GetFullPathNameA](/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfullpathnamea).

The version of this function that has the **_nolock** suffix behaves identically to this function except that it is not thread-safe and is not protected from interference by other threads. For more information, see [_getdcwd_nolock, _wgetdcwd_nolock](getdcwd-nolock-wgetdcwd-nolock.md).

When **_DEBUG** and **_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC** are defined, calls to **_getdcwd** and **_wgetdcwd** are replaced by calls to **_getdcwd_dbg** and **_wgetdcwd_dbg** so that you can debug memory allocations. For more information, see[_getdcwd_dbg, _wgetdcwd_dbg](getdcwd-dbg-wgetdcwd-dbg.md).
