# _callnewh

Calls the currently installed *new handler*.

## Syntax

```cpp
int _callnewh(
   size_t size
   )
```

### Parameters

*size*<br/>
The amount of memory that the [new operator](../../cpp/new-operator-cpp.md) tried to allocate.

## Return Value

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|0|Failure: Either no new handler is installed or no new handler is active.|
|1|Success: The new handler is installed and active. The memory allocation can be retried.|

## Exceptions

This function throws [bad_alloc](../../standard-library/bad-alloc-class.md) if the *new handler* canâ€™t be located.

## Remarks

The *new handler* is called if the [new operator](../../cpp/new-operator-cpp.md) fails to successfully allocate memory. The new handler might then initiate some appropriate action, such as freeing memory so that subsequent allocations succeed.

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|_callnewh|internal.h|
