# `asctime_s`, `_wasctime_s`

Convert a `tm` time structure to a character string. These functions are versions of [`asctime`, `_wasctime`](asctime-wasctime.md) with security enhancements as described in [Security features in the CRT](../security-features-in-the-crt.md).

## Syntax

```C
errno_t asctime_s(
   char* buffer,
   size_t numberOfElements,
   const struct tm *tmSource
);
errno_t _wasctime_s(
   wchar_t* buffer,
   size_t numberOfElements,
   const struct tm *tmSource
);
template <size_t size>
errno_t asctime_s(
   char (&buffer)[size],
   const struct tm *tmSource
); // C++ only
template <size_t size>
errno_t _wasctime_s(
   wchar_t (&buffer)[size],
   const struct tm *tmSource
); // C++ only
```

### Parameters

*`buffer`*\
A pointer to a buffer to store the character string result. This function assumes a pointer to a valid memory location with a size specified by *`numberOfElements`*.

*`numberOfElements`*\
The size of the buffer used to store the result.

*`tmSource`*\
Time/date structure. This function assumes a pointer to a valid `struct tm` object.

## Return value

Zero if successful. If there's a failure, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter validation](../parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, the return value is an error code. Error codes are defined in ERRNO.H. For more information, see [`errno` constants](../errno-constants.md). The actual error codes returned for each error condition are shown in the following table.

### Error conditions

| *`buffer`* | *`numberOfElements`* | *`tmSource`* | Return | Value in *`buffer`* |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NULL` | Any | Any | `EINVAL` | Not modified |
| Not `NULL` (points to valid memory) | 0 | Any | `EINVAL` | Not modified |
| Not `NULL` | 0< *`numberOfElements`* < 26 | Any | `EINVAL` | Empty string |
| Not `NULL` | >= 26 | `NULL` | `EINVAL` | Empty string |
| Not `NULL` | >= 26 | Invalid time structure or out of range values for components of the time | `EINVAL` | Empty string |

> [!NOTE]
> Error conditions for **`wasctime_s`** are similar to **`asctime_s`** with the exception that the size limit is measured in words.

## Remarks

The `asctime` function converts a time stored as a structure to a character string. The *`tmSource`* value is typically obtained from a call to `gmtime` or `localtime`. Both functions can be used to fill in a `tm` structure, as defined in TIME.H.

| timeptr member | Value |
|---|---|
| `tm_hour` | Hours since midnight (0-23) |
| `tm_isdst` | Positive if daylight saving time is in effect; 0 if daylight saving time isn't in effect; negative if status of daylight saving time is unknown. The C run-time library assumes the United States' rules for implementing the calculation of Daylight Saving Time (DST). |
| `tm_mday` | Day of month (1-31) |
| `tm_min` | Minutes after hour (0-59) |
| `tm_mon` | Month (0-11; January = 0) |
| `tm_sec` | Seconds after minute (0-59) |
| `tm_wday` | Day of week (0-6; Sunday = 0) |
| `tm_yday` | Day of year (0-365; January 1 = 0) |
| `tm_year` | Year (current year minus 1900) |

The converted character string is also adjusted according to the local time zone settings. For information about configuring the local time, see the [`time`, `_time32`, `_time64`](time-time32-time64.md), [`_ftime`, `_ftime32`, `_ftime64`](ftime-ftime32-ftime64.md), and [`localtime_s`, `_localtime32_s`, `_localtime64_s`](localtime-s-localtime32-s-localtime64-s.md) functions. For information about defining the time zone environment and global variables, see [`_tzset`](tzset.md).

The string result produced by **`asctime_s`** contains exactly 26 characters and has the form `Wed Jan  2 02:03:55 1980\n\0`. A 24-hour clock is used. All fields have a constant width. The new line character and the null character occupy the last two positions of the string. The value passed in as *`numberOfElements`* should be at least this size. If it's less, an error code, `EINVAL`, will be returned.

**`_wasctime_s`** is a wide-character version of **`asctime_s`**. **`_wasctime_s`** and **`asctime_s`** behave identically otherwise.

The debug library versions of these functions first fill the buffer with 0xFE. To disable this behavior, use [`_CrtSetDebugFillThreshold`](crtsetdebugfillthreshold.md).

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

### Generic-text routine mapping

| TCHAR.H routine | `_UNICODE` and `_MBCS` not defined | `_MBCS` defined | `_UNICODE` defined |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`_tasctime_s`** | **`asctime_s`** | **`asctime_s`** | **`_wasctime_s`** |

In C++, using these functions is simplified by template overloads; the overloads can infer buffer length automatically, eliminating the need to specify a size argument. For more information, see [Secure template overloads](../secure-template-overloads.md).

## Requirements

| Routine | Required header |
|---|---|
| **`asctime_s`** | \<time.h> |
| **`_wasctime_s`** | \<time.h> or \<wchar.h> |

## Security

If the buffer pointer isn't `NULL` and the pointer doesn't point to a valid buffer, the function will overwrite whatever is at the location. This error can also result in an access violation.

A [buffer overrun](/windows/win32/SecBP/avoiding-buffer-overruns) can occur if the size argument passed in is greater than the actual size of the buffer.

## Example

This program places the system time in the long integer `aclock`, translates it into the structure `newtime`, and then converts it to string form for output, using the **`asctime_s`** function.

```C
// crt_asctime_s.c
#include <time.h>
#include <stdio.h>

struct tm newtime;
__time32_t aclock;

int main( void )
{
   char buffer[32];
   errno_t errNum;
   _time32( &aclock );   // Get time in seconds.
   _localtime32_s( &newtime, &aclock );   // Convert time to struct tm form.

   // Print local time as a string.

   errNum = asctime_s(buffer, 32, &newtime);
   if (errNum)
   {
       printf("Error code: %d", (int)errNum);
       return 1;
   }
   printf( "Current date and time: %s", buffer );
   return 0;
}
```

```Output
Current date and time: Wed May 14 15:30:17 2003
```
