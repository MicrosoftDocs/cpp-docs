# ftell, _ftelli64

Gets the current position of a file pointer.

## Syntax

```C
long ftell(
   FILE *stream
);
__int64 _ftelli64(
   FILE *stream
);
```

### Parameters

*stream*<br/>
Target **FILE** structure.

## Return Value

**ftell** and **_ftelli64** return the current file position. The value returned by **ftell** and **_ftelli64** may not reflect the physical byte offset for streams opened in text mode, because text mode causes carriage return-linefeed translation. Use **ftell** with [fseek](fseek-fseeki64.md) or **_ftelli64** with [_fseeki64](fseek-fseeki64.md) to return to file locations correctly. On error, **ftell** and **_ftelli64** invoke the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return -1L and set **errno** to one of two constants, defined in ERRNO.H. The **EBADF** constant means the *stream* argument is not a valid file pointer value or does not refer to an open file. **EINVAL** means an invalid *stream* argument was passed to the function. On devices incapable of seeking (such as terminals and printers), or when *stream* does not refer to an open file, the return value is undefined.

See [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md) for more information on these, and other, return codes.

## Remarks

The **ftell** and **_ftelli64** functions retrieve the current position of the file pointer (if any) associated with *stream*. The position is expressed as an offset relative to the beginning of the stream.

Note that when a file is opened for appending data, the current file position is determined by the last I/O operation, not by where the next write would occur. For example, if a file is opened for an append and the last operation was a read, the file position is the point where the next read operation would start, not where the next write would start. (When a file is opened for appending, the file position is moved to end of file before any write operation.) If no I/O operation has yet occurred on a file opened for appending, the file position is the beginning of the file.

In text mode, CTRL+Z is interpreted as an end-of-file character on input. In files opened for reading/writing, **fopen** and all related routines check for a CTRL+Z at the end of the file and remove it if possible. This is done because using the combination of **ftell** and [fseek](fseek-fseeki64.md) or **_ftelli64** and [_fseeki64](fseek-fseeki64.md), to move within a file that ends with a CTRL+Z may cause **ftell** or **_ftelli64** to behave improperly near the end of the file.

This function locks the calling thread during execution and is therefore thread-safe. For a non-locking version, see **_ftell_nolock**.

## Requirements

|Function|Required header|Optional headers|
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
|**ftell**|\<stdio.h>|\<errno.h>|
|**_ftelli64**|\<stdio.h>|\<errno.h>|

For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_ftell.c
// This program opens a file named CRT_FTELL.C
// for reading and tries to read 100 characters. It
// then uses ftell to determine the position of the
// file pointer and displays this position.

#include <stdio.h>

FILE *stream;

int main( void )
{
   long position;
   char list[100];
   if( fopen_s( &stream, "crt_ftell.c", "rb" ) == 0 )
   {
      // Move the pointer by reading data:
      fread( list, sizeof( char ), 100, stream );
      // Get position after read:
      position = ftell( stream );
      printf( "Position after trying to read 100 bytes: %ld\n",
              position );
      fclose( stream );
   }
}
```

```Output
Position after trying to read 100 bytes: 100
```
