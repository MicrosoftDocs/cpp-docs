# mbsrtowcs_s

Convert a multibyte character string in the current locale to its wide character string representation. A version of [mbsrtowcs](mbsrtowcs.md) with security enhancements as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).

## Syntax

```C
errno_t mbsrtowcs_s(
   size_t * pReturnValue,
   wchar_t * wcstr,
   size_t sizeInWords,
   const char ** mbstr,
   size_t count,
   mbstate_t * mbstate
);
template <size_t size>
errno_t mbsrtowcs_s(
   size_t * pReturnValue,
   wchar_t (&wcstr)[size],
   const char ** mbstr,
   size_t count,
   mbstate_t * mbstate
); // C++ only
```

### Parameters

*pReturnValue*<br/>
The number of characters converted.

*wcstr*<br/>
Address of buffer to store the resulting converted wide character string.

*sizeInWords*<br/>
The size of *wcstr* in words (wide characters).

*mbstr*<br/>
Indirect pointer to the location of the multibyte character string to be converted.

*count*<br/>
The maximum number of wide characters to store in the *wcstr* buffer, not including the terminating null, or [_TRUNCATE](../../c-runtime-library/truncate.md).

*mbstate*<br/>
A pointer to an **mbstate_t** conversion state object. If this value is a null pointer, a static internal conversion state object is used. Because the internal **mbstate_t** object is not thread-safe, we recommend that you always pass your own *mbstate* parameter.

## Return Value

Zero if conversion is successful, or an error code on failure.

|Error condition|Return value and **errno**|
|---------------------|------------------------------|
|*wcstr* is a null pointer and *sizeInWords* > 0|**EINVAL**|
|*mbstr* is a null pointer|**EINVAL**|
|The string indirectly pointed to by *mbstr* contains a multibyte sequence that is not valid for the current locale.|**EILSEQ**|
|The destination buffer is too small to contain the converted string (unless *count* is **_TRUNCATE**; for more information, see Remarks)|**ERANGE**|

If any one of these conditions occurs, the invalid parameter exception is invoked as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md) . If execution is allowed to continue, the function returns an error code and sets **errno** as indicated in the table.

## Remarks

The **mbsrtowcs_s** function converts a string of multibyte characters indirectly pointed to by *mbstr* into wide characters stored in the buffer pointed to by *wcstr*, by using the conversion state contained in *mbstate*. The conversion will continue for each character until one of these conditions is met:

- A multibyte null character is encountered

- An invalid multibyte character is encountered

- The number of wide characters stored in the *wcstr* buffer equals *count*.

The destination string *wcstr* is always null-terminated, even in the case of an error, unless *wcstr* is a null pointer.

If *count* is the special value [_TRUNCATE](../../c-runtime-library/truncate.md), **mbsrtowcs_s** converts as much of the string as will fit into the destination buffer, while still leaving room for a null terminator.

If **mbsrtowcs_s** successfully converts the source string, it puts the size in wide characters of the converted string and the null terminator into *&#42;pReturnValue*, provided *pReturnValue* is not a null pointer. This occurs even if the *wcstr* argument is a null pointer and lets you determine the required buffer size. Note that if *wcstr* is a null pointer, *count* is ignored.

If *wcstr* is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by *mbstr* is assigned a null pointer if conversion stopped because a terminating null character was reached. Otherwise, it is assigned the address just past the last multibyte character converted, if any. This allows a subsequent function call to restart conversion where this call stopped.

If *mbstate* is a null pointer, the library internal **mbstate_t** conversion state static object is used. Because this internal static object is not thread-safe, we recommend that you pass your own *mbstate* value.

If **mbsrtowcs_s** encounters a multibyte character that is not valid in the current locale, it puts -1 in *&#42;pReturnValue*, sets the destination buffer *wcstr* to an empty string, sets **errno** to **EILSEQ**, and returns **EILSEQ**.

If the sequences pointed to by *mbstr* and *wcstr* overlap, the behavior of **mbsrtowcs_s** is undefined. **mbsrtowcs_s** is affected by the LC_TYPE category of the current locale.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that *wcstr* and *mbstr* do not overlap, and that *count* correctly reflects the number of multibyte characters to convert.

The **mbsrtowcs_s** function differs from [mbstowcs_s, _mbstowcs_s_l](mbstowcs-s-mbstowcs-s-l.md) by its restartability. The conversion state is stored in *mbstate* for subsequent calls to the same or other restartable functions. Results are undefined when mixing the use of restartable and nonrestartable functions. For example, an application should use **mbsrlen** instead of **mbslen**, if a subsequent call to **mbsrtowcs_s** is used instead of **mbstowcs_s**.

In C++, using this function is simplified by template overloads; the overloads can infer buffer length automatically (eliminating the requirement to specify a size argument) and they can automatically replace older, non-secure functions by using their newer, secure counterparts. For more information, see [Secure Template Overloads](../../c-runtime-library/secure-template-overloads.md).

## Exceptions

The **mbsrtowcs_s** function is multithread safe if no function in the current thread calls **setlocale** as long as this function is executing and the *mbstate* argument is not a null pointer.
