# `logb`, `logbf`, `logbl`, `_logb`, `_logbf`

Extracts the exponent value of a floating-point argument.

## Syntax

```C
double logb(
   double x
);
float logb(
   float x
); // C++ only
long double logb(
   long double x
); // C++ only
float logbf(
   float x
);
long double logbl(
   long double x
);
double _logb(
   double x
);
float _logbf(
   float x
);
#define logb(X) // Requires C11 or later
```

### Parameters

*`x`*\
A floating-point value.

## Return value

**`logb`** returns the unbiased exponent value of *`x`* as a signed integer represented as a floating-point value.

## Remarks

The **`logb`** functions extract the exponential value of the floating-point argument *`x`*, as though *`x`* were represented with infinite range. If the argument *`x`* is denormalized, it's treated as if it were normalized.

Because C++ allows overloading, you can call overloads of **`logb`** that take and return **`float`** or **`long double`** values. In a C program, unless you're using the `<tgmath.h>` macro to call this function, **`logb`** always takes and returns a **`double`**.

If you use the `logb` macro from `<tgmath.h>`, the type of the argument determines which version of the function is selected. See [Type-generic math](../tgmath.md) for details.

| Input | SEH exception | `_matherr` exception |
|---|---|---|
| ± QNaN, IND | None | `_DOMAIN` |
| ± 0 | `ZERODIVIDE` | `_SING` |

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

## Requirements

| Routine | Required header |
|---|---|
| **`_logb`** | `<float.h>` |
| **`logb`**, **`logbf`**, **`logbl`**, **`_logbf`** | `<math.h>` |
| **`logb`** macro | `<tgmath.h>` |

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../compatibility.md).

## Libraries
