# wcstombs_s, _wcstombs_s_l

Converts a sequence of wide characters to a corresponding sequence of multibyte characters. A version of [wcstombs, _wcstombs_l](wcstombs-wcstombs-l.md) with security enhancements as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).

## Syntax

```C
errno_t wcstombs_s(
   size_t *pReturnValue,
   char *mbstr,
   size_t sizeInBytes,
   const wchar_t *wcstr,
   size_t count
);

errno_t _wcstombs_s_l(
   size_t *pReturnValue,
   char *mbstr,
   size_t sizeInBytes,
   const wchar_t *wcstr,
   size_t count,
   _locale_t locale
);

template <size_t size>
errno_t wcstombs_s(
   size_t *pReturnValue,
   char (&mbstr)[size],
   const wchar_t *wcstr,
   size_t count
); // C++ only

template <size_t size>
errno_t _wcstombs_s_l(
   size_t *pReturnValue,
   char (&mbstr)[size],
   const wchar_t *wcstr,
   size_t count,
   _locale_t locale
); // C++ only
```

### Parameters

*pReturnValue*<br/>
The number of characters converted.

*mbstr*<br/>
The address of a buffer for the resulting converted multibyte character string.

*sizeInBytes*<br/>
The size in bytes of the *mbstr* buffer.

*wcstr*<br/>
Points to the wide character string to be converted.

*count*<br/>
The maximum number of bytes to store in the *mbstr* buffer, not including the terminating null character, or [_TRUNCATE](../../c-runtime-library/truncate.md).

*locale*<br/>
The locale to use.

## Return Value

Zero if successful, an error code on failure.

|Error condition|Return value and **errno**|
|---------------------|------------------------------|
|*mbstr* is **NULL** and *sizeInBytes* > 0|**EINVAL**|
|*wcstr* is **NULL**|**EINVAL**|
|The destination buffer is too small to contain the converted string (unless *count* is **_TRUNCATE**; see Remarks below)|**ERANGE**|

If any of these conditions occurs, the invalid parameter exception is invoked as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md) . If execution is allowed to continue, the function returns an error code and sets **errno** as indicated in the table.

## Remarks

The **wcstombs_s** function converts a string of wide characters pointed to by *wcstr* into multibyte characters stored in the buffer pointed to by *mbstr*. The conversion will continue for each character until one of these conditions is met:

- A null wide character is encountered

- A wide character that cannot be converted is encountered

- The number of bytes stored in the *mbstr* buffer equals *count*.

The destination string is always null-terminated (even in the case of an error).

If *count* is the special value [_TRUNCATE](../../c-runtime-library/truncate.md), then **wcstombs_s** converts as much of the string as will fit into the destination buffer, while still leaving room for a null terminator. If the string is truncated, the return value is **STRUNCATE**, and the conversion is considered successful.

If **wcstombs_s** successfully converts the source string, it puts the size in bytes of the converted string, including the null terminator, into *&#42;pReturnValue* (provided *pReturnValue* is not **NULL**). This occurs even if the *mbstr* argument is **NULL** and provides a way to determine the required buffer size. Note that if *mbstr* is **NULL**, *count* is ignored.

If **wcstombs_s** encounters a wide character it cannot convert to a multibyte character, it puts 0 in *&#42;pReturnValue*, sets the destination buffer to an empty string, sets **errno** to **EILSEQ**, and returns **EILSEQ**.

If the sequences pointed to by *wcstr* and *mbstr* overlap, the behavior of **wcstombs_s** is undefined.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that *wcstr* and *mbstr* do not overlap, and that *count* correctly reflects the number of wide characters to convert.

**wcstombs_s** uses the current locale for any locale-dependent behavior; **_wcstombs_s_l** is identical to **wcstombs** except that it uses the locale passed in instead. For more information, see [Locale](../../c-runtime-library/locale.md).

In C++, using these functions is simplified by template overloads; the overloads can infer buffer length automatically (eliminating the need to specify a size argument) and they can automatically replace older, non-secure functions with their newer, secure counterparts. For more information, see [Secure Template Overloads](../../c-runtime-library/secure-template-overloads.md).

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**wcstombs_s**|\<stdlib.h>|

For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Example

This program illustrates the behavior of the **wcstombs_s** function.

```C
// crt_wcstombs_s.c
// This example converts a wide character
// string to a multibyte character string.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <assert.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 100

int main( void )
{
    size_t   i;
    char      *pMBBuffer = (char *)malloc( BUFFER_SIZE );
    wchar_t*pWCBuffer = L"Hello, world.";

    printf( "Convert wide-character string:\n" );

    // Conversion
    wcstombs_s(&i, pMBBuffer, (size_t)BUFFER_SIZE,
               pWCBuffer, (size_t)BUFFER_SIZE );

    // Output
    printf("   Characters converted: %u\n", i);
    printf("    Multibyte character: %s\n\n",
     pMBBuffer );

    // Free multibyte character buffer
    if (pMBBuffer)
    {
    free(pMBBuffer);
    }
}
```

```Output
Convert wide-character string:
   Characters converted: 14
    Multibyte character: Hello, world.
```
