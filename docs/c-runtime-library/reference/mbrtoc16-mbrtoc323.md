# mbrtoc16, mbrtoc32

Translates the first multibyte character in a narrow string into the equivalent UTF-16 or UTF-32 character.

## Syntax

```C
size_t mbrtoc16(
   char16_t* destination,
   const char* source,
   size_t max_bytes,
   mbstate_t* state
);

size_t mbrtoc32(
   char32_t* destination,
   const char* source,
   size_t max_bytes,
   mbstate_t* state
);

```

### Parameters

*destination*<br/>
Pointer to the **char16_t** or **char32_t** equivalent of the multibyte character to convert. If null, the function does not store a value.

*source*<br/>
Pointer to the multibyte character string to convert.

*max_bytes*<br/>
The maximum number of bytes in *source* to examine for a character to convert. This should be a value between one and the number of bytes, including any null terminator, remaining in *source*.

*state*<br/>
Pointer to a **mbstate_t** conversion state object used to interpret the multibyte string to one or more output characters.

## Return Value

On success, returns the value of the first of these conditions that applies, given the current *state* value:

|Value|Condition|
|-----------|---------------|
|0|The next *max_bytes* or fewer characters converted from *source* correspond to the null wide character, which is the value stored if *destination* is not null.<br /><br /> *state* contains the initial shift state.|
|Between 1 and *max_bytes*, inclusive|The value returned is the number of bytes of *source* that complete a valid multibyte character. The converted wide character is stored  if *destination* is not null.|
|-3|The next wide character resulting from a previous call to the function has been stored in *destination* if *destination* is not null. No bytes from *source* are consumed by this call to the function.<br /><br /> When  *source* points to a multibyte character that requires more than one wide character to represent (for example, a surrogate pair), then the *state* value is updated so that the next function call writes  out the additional character.|
|-2|The next *max_bytes* bytes represent an incomplete, but potentially valid, multibyte character. No value is stored in *destination*. This result can occur if *max_bytes* is zero.|
|-1|An encoding error has occurred. The next *max_bytes* or fewer bytes do not contribute to a complete and valid multibyte character. No value is stored in *destination*.<br /><br /> **EILSEQ** is stored in **errno** and the conversion state *state* is unspecified.|

## Remarks

The **mbrtoc16** function reads up to *max_bytes* bytes from *source* to find  the first complete, valid multibyte character, and then stores the equivalent UTF-16 character in *destination*. The source bytes are interpreted according to the current thread multibyte locale. If the multibyte character requires more than one UTF-16 output character, such as a surrogate pair, then the *state* value is set to store the next UTF-16 character in *destination* on the next call to **mbrtoc16**. The **mbrtoc32** function is identical, but output is stored as a UTF-32 character.

If *source* is null, these functions return the equivalent of a call made using arguments of **NULL** for *destination*, **""** for *source*,  and 1 for *max_bytes*. The passed values of *destination* and *max_bytes* are ignored.

If *source* is not null, the function starts at the beginning of the string and inspects up to *max_bytes* bytes to determine the number of bytes required to complete the next multibyte character, including any shift sequences. If the examined bytes contain a valid and complete multibyte character, the function converts the character into the equivalent 16-bit or 32-bit wide character or characters. If *destination* is not null, the function stores the first (and possibly only) result character in destination. If additional output characters are required, a value is set in *state*, so that subsequent calls to the function output the additional characters and return the value -3. If no more output characters are required, then *state* is set to the initial shift state.
