# `mbrtoc16`, `mbrtoc32`

Translates the first UTF-8 multibyte character in a string into the equivalent UTF-16 or UTF-32 character.

## Syntax

```C
size_t mbrtoc16(
   char16_t* destination,
   const char* source,
   size_t max_bytes,
   mbstate_t* state
);

size_t mbrtoc32(
   char32_t* destination,
   const char* source,
   size_t max_bytes,
   mbstate_t* state
);
```

### Parameters

*`destination`*\
Pointer to the **`char16_t`** or **`char32_t`** equivalent of the UTF-8 multibyte character to convert. If null, the function doesn't store a value.

*`source`*\
Pointer to the UTF-8 multibyte character string to convert.

*`max_bytes`*\
The maximum number of bytes in *`source`* to examine for a character to convert. This argument should be a value between one and the number of bytes, including any null terminator, remaining in *`source`*.

*`state`*\
Pointer to a `mbstate_t` conversion state object used to interpret the UTF-8 multibyte string to one or more output characters.

## Return value

On success, returns the value of the first of these conditions that applies, given the current *`state`* value:

| Value | Condition |
|---|---|
| 0 | The next *`max_bytes`* or fewer characters converted from *`source`* correspond to the null wide character, which is the value stored if *`destination`* isn't null.<br /><br /> *`state`* contains the initial shift state. |
| Between 1 and *`max_bytes`*, inclusive | The value returned is the number of bytes of *`source`* that complete a valid multibyte character. The converted wide character is stored if *`destination`* isn't null. |
| -3 | The next wide character resulting from a previous call to the function has been stored in *`destination`* if *`destination`* isn't null. No bytes from *`source`* are consumed by this call to the function.<br /><br /> When  *`source`* points to a UTF-8 multibyte character that requires more than one wide character to represent (for example, a surrogate pair), then the *`state`* value is updated so that the next function call writes out the extra character. |
| -2 | The next *`max_bytes`* bytes represent an incomplete, but potentially valid, UTF-8 multibyte character. No value is stored in *`destination`*. This result can occur if *`max_bytes`* is zero. |
| -1 | An encoding error has occurred. The next *`max_bytes`* or fewer bytes don't contribute to a complete and valid UTF-8 multibyte character. No value is stored in *`destination`*.<br /><br /> `EILSEQ` is stored in `errno` and the conversion state value *`state`* is unspecified. |

## Remarks

The **`mbrtoc16`** function reads up to *`max_bytes`* bytes from *`source`* to find the first complete, valid UTF-8 multibyte character, and then stores the equivalent UTF-16 character in *`destination`*. If the character requires more than one UTF-16 output character, such as a surrogate pair, then the *`state`* value is set to store the next UTF-16 character in *`destination`* on the next call to **`mbrtoc16`**. The **`mbrtoc32`** function is identical, but output is stored as a UTF-32 character.

If *`source`* is null, these functions return the equivalent of a call made using arguments of `NULL` for *`destination`*, `""` (an empty, null-terminated string) for *`source`*, and 1 for *`max_bytes`*. The passed values of *`destination`* and *`max_bytes`* are ignored.

If *`source`* isn't null, the function starts at the beginning of the string and inspects up to *`max_bytes`* bytes to determine the number of bytes required to complete the next UTF-8 multibyte character, including any shift sequences. If the examined bytes contain a valid and complete UTF-8 multibyte character, the function converts the character into the equivalent 16-bit or 32-bit wide character or characters. If *`destination`* isn't null, the function stores the first (and possibly only) result character in destination. If extra output characters are required, a value is set in *`state`*, so that subsequent calls to the function output the extra characters and return the value -3. If no more output characters are required, then *`state`* is set to the initial shift state.

To convert non-UTF-8 multibyte characters to UTF-16 LE characters, use the [`mbrtowc`](mbrtowc.md), [mbtowc, or _mbtowc_l](mbtowc-mbtowc-l.md) functions.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).
