# `vsnprintf_s`, `_vsnprintf_s`, `_vsnprintf_s_l`, `_vsnwprintf_s`, `_vsnwprintf_s_l`

Write formatted output using a pointer to a list of arguments. These functions are versions of [`vsnprintf`, `_vsnprintf`, `_vsnprintf_l`, `_vsnwprintf`, `_vsnwprintf_l`](vsnprintf-vsnprintf-vsnprintf-l-vsnwprintf-vsnwprintf-l.md) with security enhancements as described in [Security features in the CRT](../security-features-in-the-crt.md).

## Syntax

```C
int vsnprintf_s(
   char *buffer,
   size_t sizeOfBuffer,
   size_t count,
   const char *format,
   va_list argptr
);

int _vsnprintf_s(
   char *buffer,
   size_t sizeOfBuffer,
   size_t count,
   const char *format,
   va_list argptr
);

int _vsnprintf_s_l(
   char *buffer,
   size_t sizeOfBuffer,
   size_t count,
   const char *format,
   _locale_t locale,
   va_list argptr
);

int _vsnwprintf_s(
   wchar_t *buffer,
   size_t sizeOfBuffer,
   size_t count,
   const wchar_t *format,
   va_list argptr
);

int _vsnwprintf_s_l(
   wchar_t *buffer,
   size_t sizeOfBuffer,
   size_t count,
   const wchar_t *format,
   _locale_t locale,
   va_list argptr
);

template <size_t size>
int _vsnprintf_s(
   char (&buffer)[size],
   size_t count,
   const char *format,
   va_list argptr
); // C++ only

template <size_t size>
int _vsnwprintf_s(
   wchar_t (&buffer)[size],
   size_t count,
   const wchar_t *format,
   va_list argptr
); // C++ only
```

### Parameters

*`buffer`*\
Storage location for output.

*`sizeOfBuffer`*\
The size of the *`buffer`* for output. Size in **bytes** for the functions that take `char`, and **words** for those that take `wchar_t`.

*`count`*\
Maximum number of characters to write not including the terminating `NULL`. For the functions that take `wchar_t`, it's the number of wide characters to write. Or [`_TRUNCATE`](../truncate.md).

*`format`*\
Format specification.

*`argptr`*\
Pointer to list of arguments.

*`locale`*\
The locale to use when formatting the output.

For more information, see [Format specifications](../format-specification-syntax-printf-and-wprintf-functions.md).

## Return value

The number of characters written, not including the terminating `NULL`, or a negative value if an output error occurs.

See [Behavior summary](#behavior-summary) for details.

## Remarks

Each of these functions takes a pointer to an argument list, then formats and writes up to *`count`* characters of the given data to the memory pointed to by *`buffer`* and appends a terminating `NULL`.

In debug builds, the remaining `sizeOfBuffer` bytes following the terminating `NULL` are filled with 'xFE' as described in [`_CrtSetDebugFillThreshold`](crtsetdebugfillthreshold.md).

The versions of these functions with the **`_l`** suffix are identical except that they use the locale parameter passed in instead of the current thread locale.

**`vsnprintf_s`** is identical to **`_vsnprintf_s`** and is included for conformance to the ANSI standard. **`_vnsprintf`** is retained for backward compatibility.

### Behavior summary

For the following table:

- Let `len` be the size of the formatted data. If the function takes a `char` buffer, the size is in bytes. If the function takes a `wchar_t` buffer, the size specifies the number of 16-bit words. 
- Characters refer to `char` characters for functions that take a `char` buffer, and to `wchar_t` characters for functions that take a `wchar_t` buffer.
- For more information about the invalid parameter handler, see [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md).

| Condition | Behavior | Return value | `errno` | Invokes invalid parameter handler|
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Success | Writes the characters into the buffer using the specified format string | The number of characters written | N/A | No |
| Encoding error during formatting | If processing string specifier `s`, `S`, or `Z`, format specification processing stops. | -1 | `EILSEQ (42)` | No |
| Encoding error during formatting | If processing character specifier `c` or `C`, the invalid character is skipped. The number of characters written isn't incremented for the skipped character, nor is any data written for it. Processing the format specification continues after skipping the specifier with the encoding error. | The number of characters written, not including the terminating `NULL`. | `EILSEQ (42)` | No |
| `buffer == NULL` and `sizeOfBuffer == 0` and `count == 0` | No data is written. | 0 | N/A | No |
| `buffer == NULL` and either `sizeOfBuffer != 0` or `count != 0` | If execution continues after invalid parameter handler executes, sets `errno` and returns a negative value.| -1 | `EINVAL` (22) | Yes |
| `buffer != NULL` and `sizeOfBuffer == 0` | No data is written. If execution continues after invalid parameter handler executes, sets `errno` and returns a negative value. | -1 | `EINVAL` (22) | Yes |
| `buffer != NULL` and `sizeOfBuffer != 0` and `count == 0` | The buffer is `NULL` terminated. | -1 | N/A | No |
| `count == 0`| Doesn't write any data and returns the number of characters that would have been written, not including the terminating `NULL`. | The number of characters that would have been written not including the terminating `NULL`. | N/A | No |
| `count < 0` | Unsafe: the value is treated as unsigned, likely creating a large value that results in overwriting the memory that follows the buffer. | The number of characters written, not including the terminating `NULL`. | N/A | No |
| `count < sizeOfBuffer` and `len <= count`  | All of the data is written and a terminating `NULL` is appended. | The number of characters written. | N/A | No |
| `count < sizeOfBuffer` and `len > count` | The first *`count`* characters are written. | -1 | N/A | No |
| `count >= sizeOfBuffer` and `len < sizeOfBuffer` | All of the data is written with a terminating `NULL`. | The number of characters written, not including the terminating `NULL`. | N/A | No |
| `count >= sizeOfBuffer` and `len >= sizeOfBuffer` and `count != _TRUNCATE` | If execution continues after invalid parameter handler executes, sets `errno`, sets `buffer[0] == NULL`, and returns a negative value. | -1 | `ERANGE` (34) | Yes |
| `count == _TRUNCATE` and `len >= sizeOfBuffer` | Writes as much of the string as fits in *`buffer`*, including the terminating `NULL`. | -1 | N/A | No |
| `count == _TRUNCATE` and `len < sizeOfBuffer` | Writes the entire string into *`buffer`* with terminating `NULL`. | Number of characters written. | N/A | No |
| `format == NULL` | No data is written. If execution continues after invalid parameter handler executes, sets `errno` and returns a negative value. | -1 | `EINVAL` (22) | Yes |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that *`format`* is not a user-defined string. For more information, see [Avoiding buffer overruns](/windows/win32/SecBP/avoiding-buffer-overruns).
> Starting in Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041), the `printf` family of functions prints exactly representable floating point numbers according to the IEEE 754 rules for rounding. In previous versions of Windows, exactly representable floating point numbers ending in '5' would always round up. IEEE 754 states that they must round to the closest even digit (also known as "Banker's Rounding"). For example, both `printf("%1.0f", 1.5)` and `printf("%1.0f", 2.5)` should round to 2. Previously, 1.5 would round to 2 and 2.5 would round to 3. This change only affects exactly representable numbers. For example, 2.35 (which, when represented in memory, is closer to 2.35000000000000008) continues to round up to 2.4. Rounding done by these functions now also respects the floating point rounding mode set by [`fesetround`](fegetround-fesetround2.md). Previously, rounding always chose `FE_TONEAREST` behavior. This change only affects programs built using Visual Studio 2019 version 16.2 and later. To use the legacy floating point rounding behavior, link with [`legacy_stdio_float_rounding.obj`](../link-options.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure that there is room for the terminating `NULL`, be sure that *`count`* is strictly less than the buffer length, or use `_TRUNCATE`.

In C++, using these functions is simplified by template overloads; the overloads can infer buffer length automatically (eliminating the need to specify a size argument) and they can automatically replace older, non-secure functions with their newer, secure counterparts. For more information, see [Secure template overloads](../secure-template-overloads.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you get an undefined external `_vsnprintf_s` error and are using the Universal C Runtime, add `legacy_stdio_definitions.lib` to the set of libraries to link. The Universal C Runtime doesn't export this function directly and is instead defined inline in `<stdio.h>`. For more information, see [Overview of potential upgrade issues](../../porting/overview-of-potential-upgrade-issues-visual-cpp.md#libraries) and [Visual Studio 2015 conformance changes](../../porting/visual-cpp-change-history-2003-2015.md#stdio_and_conio).
