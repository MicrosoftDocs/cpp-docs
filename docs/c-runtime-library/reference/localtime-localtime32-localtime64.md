# `localtime`, `_localtime32`, `_localtime64`

Converts a time value and corrects for the local time zone. More secure versions of these functions are available; see [`localtime_s`, `_localtime32_s`, `_localtime64_s`](localtime-s-localtime32-s-localtime64-s.md).

## Syntax

```C
struct tm *localtime( const time_t *sourceTime ); // See note in remarks section about linkage
struct tm *_localtime32( const __time32_t *sourceTime );
struct tm *_localtime64( const __time64_t *sourceTime );
```

### Parameters

*`sourceTime`*\
Pointer to stored time.

## Return value

Return a pointer to the structure result, or `NULL` if the date passed to the function is:

- Before midnight, January 1, 1970.

- After 03:14:07, January 19, 2038, UTC (using **`_time32`** and **`time32_t`**).

- After 23:59:59, December 31, 3000, UTC (using **`_time64`** and **`__time64_t`**).

**`_localtime64`**, which uses the **`__time64_t`** structure, allows dates to be expressed up through 23:59:59, December 31, 3000, coordinated universal time (UTC), whereas **`_localtime32`** represents dates through 23:59:59 January 18, 2038, UTC.

**`localtime`** is an inline function that evaluates to **`_localtime64`**, and **`time_t`** is equivalent to **`__time64_t`**. If you need to force the compiler to interpret **`time_t`** as the old 32-bit **`time_t`**, you can define `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T`. `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T` causes **`localtime`** to evaluate to **`_localtime32`**. We don't recommend `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T`, because your application may fail after January 18, 2038, and it isn't allowed on 64-bit platforms.

The fields of the structure type [`tm`](../standard-types.md) store the following values, each of which is an **`int`**:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **`tm_sec`** | Seconds after minute (0 - 59). |
| **`tm_min`** | Minutes after hour (0 - 59). |
| **`tm_hour`** | Hours since midnight (0 - 23). |
| **`tm_mday`** | Day of month (1 - 31). |
| **`tm_mon`** | Month (0 - 11; January = 0). |
| **`tm_year`** | Year (current year minus 1900). |
| **`tm_wday`** | Day of week (0 - 6; Sunday = 0). |
| **`tm_yday`** | Day of year (0 - 365; January 1 = 0). |
| **`tm_isdst`** | Positive value if daylight saving time is in effect; 0 if daylight saving time isn't in effect; negative value if status of daylight saving time is unknown. |

If the **`TZ`** environment variable is set, the C run-time library assumes rules appropriate to the United States for implementing the calculation of daylight-saving time (DST).

## Remarks

The **`localtime`** function converts a time stored as a [`time_t`](../standard-types.md) value and stores the result in a structure of type [`tm`](../standard-types.md). The **`long`** value *`sourceTime`* represents the seconds elapsed since midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970, UTC. This value is often obtained from the [`time`](time-time32-time64.md) function.

Both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of [`gmtime`](gmtime-gmtime32-gmtime64.md), [`mktime`](mktime-mktime32-mktime64.md), [`mkgmtime`](mkgmtime-mkgmtime32-mkgmtime64.md), and **`localtime`** all use a single **`tm`** structure per thread for the conversion. Each call to one of these routines destroys the result of the previous call.

**`localtime`** corrects for the local time zone if the user first sets the global environment variable **`TZ`**. When **`TZ`** is set, three other environment variables (**`_timezone`**, **`_daylight`**, and **`_tzname`**) are automatically set as well. If the **`TZ`** variable isn't set, **`localtime`** attempts to use the time zone information specified in the Date/Time application in Control Panel. If this information can't be obtained, PST8PDT, which signifies the Pacific Time Zone, is used by default. See [`_tzset`](tzset.md) for a description of these variables. **`TZ`** is a Microsoft extension and not part of the ANSI standard definition of **`localtime`**.

> [!NOTE]
> The target environment should try to determine whether daylight saving time is in effect.

These functions validate their parameters. If *`sourceTime`* is a null pointer, or if the *`sourceTime`* value is negative, these functions invoke an invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter validation](../parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, the functions return `NULL` and set `errno` to `EINVAL`.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

> [!Note]
> When you use Windows SDK version 10.0.26100.6901 and Visual Studio 2026 or later together, `localtime` is no longer `static inline` (internal linkage). Instead, it's `inline` (external linkage).\
> To return to the previous behavior, `#define _STATIC_INLINE_UCRT_FUNCTIONS=1` before including any CRT headers. By default, `_STATIC_INLINE_UCRT_FUNCTIONS` is set to 0.\
> This change increases UCRT conformance with the C++ standard and improves compatibility with C++ modules.

## Requirements

| Routine | Required C header | Required C++ header |
|---|---|---|
| **`localtime`**, **`_localtime32`**, **`_localtime64`** | `<time.h>` | `<ctime>` or `<time.h>` |

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../compatibility.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_localtime.cpp
// compile with: /W3
// This program uses _time64 to get the current time
// and then uses localtime64() to convert this time to a structure
// representing the local time. The program converts the result
// from a 24-hour clock to a 12-hour clock and determines the
// proper extension (AM or PM).

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>

int main( void )
{
    struct tm *newtime;
    char am_pm[] = "AM";
    __time64_t long_time;

    _time64( &long_time );             // Get time as 64-bit integer.
                                       // Convert to local time.
    newtime = _localtime64( &long_time ); // C4996
    // Note: _localtime64 deprecated; consider _localetime64_s

    if( newtime->tm_hour > 12 )        // Set up extension.
        strcpy_s( am_pm, sizeof(am_pm), "PM" );
    if( newtime->tm_hour > 12 )        // Convert from 24-hour
        newtime->tm_hour -= 12;        //   to 12-hour clock.
    if( newtime->tm_hour == 0 )        // Set hour to 12 if midnight.
        newtime->tm_hour = 12;

    char buff[30];
    asctime_s( buff, sizeof(buff), newtime );
    printf( "%.19s %s\n", buff, am_pm );
}
```

```Output
Tue Feb 12 10:05:58 AM
```
