# localtime, _localtime32, _localtime64

Converts a time value and corrects for the local time zone. More secure versions of these functions are available; see [localtime_s, _localtime32_s, _localtime64_s](localtime-s-localtime32-s-localtime64-s.md).

## Syntax

```C
struct tm *localtime( const time_t *sourceTime );
struct tm *_localtime32( const __time32_t *sourceTime );
struct tm *_localtime64( const __time64_t *sourceTime );
```

### Parameters

*sourceTime*<br/>
Pointer to stored time.

## Return Value

Return a pointer to the structure result, or **NULL** if the date passed to the function is:

- Before midnight, January 1, 1970.

- After 03:14:07, January 19, 2038, UTC (using **_time32** and **time32_t**).

- After 23:59:59, December 31, 3000, UTC (using **_time64** and **__time64_t**).

**_localtime64**, which uses the **__time64_t** structure, allows dates to be expressed up through 23:59:59, December 31, 3000, coordinated universal time (UTC), whereas **_localtime32** represents dates through 23:59:59 January 18, 2038, UTC.

**localtime** is an inline function which evaluates to **_localtime64**, and **time_t** is equivalent to **__time64_t**. If you need to force the compiler to interpret **time_t** as the old 32-bit **time_t**, you can define **_USE_32BIT_TIME_T**. Doing this will cause **localtime** to evaluate to **_localtime32**. This is not recommended because your application may fail after January 18, 2038, and it is not allowed on 64-bit platforms.

The fields of the structure type [tm](../../c-runtime-library/standard-types.md) store the following values, each of which is an **int**:

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
|**tm_sec**|Seconds after minute (0 - 59).|
|**tm_min**|Minutes after hour (0 - 59).|
|**tm_hour**|Hours since midnight (0 - 23).|
|**tm_mday**|Day of month (1 - 31).|
|**tm_mon**|Month (0 - 11; January = 0).|
|**tm_year**|Year (current year minus 1900).|
|**tm_wday**|Day of week (0 - 6; Sunday = 0).|
|**tm_yday**|Day of year (0 - 365; January 1 = 0).|
|**tm_isdst**|Positive value if daylight saving time is in effect; 0 if daylight saving time is not in effect; negative value if status of daylight saving time is unknown.|

If the **TZ** environment variable is set, the C run-time library assumes rules appropriate to the United States for implementing the calculation of daylight-saving time (DST).

## Remarks

The **localtime** function converts a time stored as a [time_t](../../c-runtime-library/standard-types.md) value and stores the result in a structure of type [tm](../../c-runtime-library/standard-types.md). The **long** value *sourceTime* represents the seconds elapsed since midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970, UTC. This value is usually obtained from the [time](time-time32-time64.md) function.

Both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of [gmtime](gmtime-gmtime32-gmtime64.md), [mktime](mktime-mktime32-mktime64.md), [mkgmtime](mkgmtime-mkgmtime32-mkgmtime64.md), and **localtime** all use a single **tm** structure per thread for the conversion. Each call to one of these routines destroys the result of the previous call.

**localtime** corrects for the local time zone if the user first sets the global environment variable **TZ**. When **TZ** is set, three other environment variables (**_timezone**, **_daylight**, and **_tzname**) are automatically set as well. If the **TZ** variable is not set, **localtime** attempts to use the time zone information specified in the Date/Time application in Control Panel. If this information cannot be obtained, PST8PDT, which signifies the Pacific Time Zone, is used by default. See [_tzset](tzset.md) for a description of these variables. **TZ** is a Microsoft extension and not part of the ANSI standard definition of **localtime**.

> [!NOTE]
> The target environment should try to determine whether daylight saving time is in effect.

These functions validate their parameters. If *sourceTime* is a null pointer, or if the *sourceTime* value is negative, these functions invoke an invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, the functions return **NULL** and set **errno** to **EINVAL**.

## Requirements

|Routine|Required C header|Required C++ header|
|-------------|---------------------|-|
|**localtime**, **_localtime32**, **_localtime64**|\<time.h>|\<ctime> or \<time.h>|

For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_localtime.cpp
// compile with: /W3
// This program uses _time64 to get the current time
// and then uses localtime64() to convert this time to a structure
// representing the local time. The program converts the result
// from a 24-hour clock to a 12-hour clock and determines the
// proper extension (AM or PM).

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>

int main( void )
{
    struct tm *newtime;
    char am_pm[] = "AM";
    __time64_t long_time;

    _time64( &long_time );             // Get time as 64-bit integer.
                                       // Convert to local time.
    newtime = _localtime64( &long_time ); // C4996
    // Note: _localtime64 deprecated; consider _localetime64_s

    if( newtime->tm_hour > 12 )        // Set up extension.
        strcpy_s( am_pm, sizeof(am_pm), "PM" );
    if( newtime->tm_hour > 12 )        // Convert from 24-hour
        newtime->tm_hour -= 12;        //   to 12-hour clock.
    if( newtime->tm_hour == 0 )        // Set hour to 12 if midnight.
        newtime->tm_hour = 12;

    char buff[30];
    asctime_s( buff, sizeof(buff), newtime );
    printf( "%.19s %s\n", buff, am_pm );
}
```

```Output
Tue Feb 12 10:05:58 AM
```
