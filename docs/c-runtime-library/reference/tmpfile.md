# tmpfile
Creates a temporary file. This function is deprecated because a more secure version is available; see [tmpfile_s](../../c-runtime-library/reference/tmpfile-s.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
FILE *tmpfile( void );  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, `tmpfile` returns a stream pointer. Otherwise, it returns a `NULL` pointer.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `tmpfile` function creates a temporary file and returns a pointer to that stream. The temporary file is created in the root directory. To create a temporary file in a directory other than the root, use [tmpnam](../../c-runtime-library/reference/tempnam-wtempnam-tmpnam-wtmpnam.md) or [tempnam](../../c-runtime-library/reference/tempnam-wtempnam-tmpnam-wtmpnam.md) in conjunction with [fopen](../../c-runtime-library/reference/fopen-wfopen.md).  
  
 If the file cannot be opened, `tmpfile` returns a `NULL` pointer. This temporary file is automatically deleted when the file is closed, when the program terminates normally, or when `_rmtmp` is called, assuming that the current working directory does not change. The temporary file is opened in `w+b` (binary read/write) mode.  
  
 Failure can occur if you attempt more than TMP_MAX (see STDIO.H) calls with `tmpfile`.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Routine|Required header|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|`tmpfile`|\<stdio.h>|  
  
 For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  
  
## Example  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This example requires administrative privileges to run on Windows Vista.  
  
```  
// crt_tmpfile.c  
// compile with: /W3  
// This program uses tmpfile to create a  
// temporary file, then deletes this file with _rmtmp.  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   FILE *stream;  
   int  i;  
  
   // Create temporary files.  
   for( i = 1; i <= 3; i++ )  
   {  
      if( (stream = tmpfile()) == NULL ) // C4996  
      // Note: tmpfile is deprecated; consider using tmpfile_s instead  
         perror( "Could not open new temporary file\n" );  
      else  
         printf( "Temporary file %d was created\n", i );  
   }  
  
   // Remove temporary files.  
   printf( "%d temporary files deleted\n", _rmtmp() );  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
Temporary file 1 was created  
Temporary file 2 was created  
Temporary file 3 was created  
3 temporary files deleted  
```  
  
## .NET Framework Equivalent  
 Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`. For more information, see [Platform Invoke Examples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/15926806-f0b7-487e-93a6-4e9367ec689f).
