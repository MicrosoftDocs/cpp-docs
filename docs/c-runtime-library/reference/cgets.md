# cgets

This POSIX function is deprecated. Use the ISO C++ conformant [_cgets](../../c-runtime-library/cgets-cgetws.md) or security-enhanced [_cgets_s](cgets-s-cgetws-s.md) instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).
