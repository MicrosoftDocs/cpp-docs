# wcsrtombs_s

Convert a wide character string to its multibyte character string representation. A version of [wcsrtombs](wcsrtombs.md) with security enhancements as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).

## Syntax

```C
errno_t wcsrtombs_s(
   size_t *pReturnValue,
   char *mbstr,
   size_t sizeInBytes,
   const wchar_t **wcstr,
   sizeof count,
   mbstate_t *mbstate
);
template <size_t size>
errno_t wcsrtombs_s(
   size_t *pReturnValue,
   char (&mbstr)[size],
   const wchar_t **wcstr,
   sizeof count,
   mbstate_t *mbstate
); // C++ only
```

### Parameters

*pReturnValue*<br/>
The number of characters converted.

*mbstr*<br/>
The address of a buffer for the resulting converted multibyte character string.

*sizeInBytes*<br/>
The size in bytes of the *mbstr* buffer.

*wcstr*<br/>
Points to the wide character string to be converted.

*count*<br/>
The maximum number of bytes to be stored in the *mbstr* buffer, or [_TRUNCATE](../../c-runtime-library/truncate.md).

*mbstate*<br/>
A pointer to an **mbstate_t** conversion state object.

## Return Value

Zero if successful, an error code on failure.

|Error condition|Return value and **errno**|
|---------------------|------------------------------|
|*mbstr* is **NULL** and *sizeInBytes* > 0|**EINVAL**|
|*wcstr* is **NULL**|**EINVAL**|
|The destination buffer is too small to contain the converted string (unless *count* is **_TRUNCATE**; see Remarks below)|**ERANGE**|

If any of these conditions occurs, the invalid parameter exception is invoked as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md) . If execution is allowed to continue, the function returns an error code and sets **errno** as indicated in the table.

## Remarks

The **wcsrtombs_s** function converts a string of wide characters pointed to by *wcstr* into multibyte characters stored in the buffer pointed to by *mbstr*, using the conversion state contained in *mbstate*. The conversion will continue for each character until one of these conditions is met:

- A null wide character is encountered

- A wide character that cannot be converted is encountered

- The number of bytes stored in the *mbstr* buffer equals *count*.

The destination string is always null-terminated (even in the case of an error).

If *count* is the special value [_TRUNCATE](../../c-runtime-library/truncate.md), then **wcsrtombs_s** converts as much of the string as will fit into the destination buffer, while still leaving room for a null terminator.

If **wcsrtombs_s** successfully converts the source string, it puts the size in bytes of the converted string, including the null terminator, into *&#42;pReturnValue* (provided *pReturnValue* is not **NULL**). This occurs even if the *mbstr* argument is **NULL** and provides a way to determine the required buffer size. Note that if *mbstr* is **NULL**, *count* is ignored.

If **wcsrtombs_s** encounters a wide character it cannot convert to a multibyte character, it puts -1 in *\*pReturnValue*, sets the destination buffer to an empty string, sets **errno** to **EILSEQ**, and returns **EILSEQ**.

If the sequences pointed to by *wcstr* and *mbstr* overlap, the behavior of **wcsrtombs_s** is undefined. **wcsrtombs_s** is affected by the LC_TYPE category of the current locale.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that *wcstr* and *mbstr* do not overlap, and that *count* correctly reflects the number of wide characters to convert.

The **wcsrtombs_s** function differs from [wcstombs_s, _wcstombs_s_l](wcstombs-s-wcstombs-s-l.md) by its restartability. The conversion state is stored in *mbstate* for subsequent calls to the same or other restartable functions. Results are undefined when mixing the use of restartable and nonrestartable functions. For example, an application would use **wcsrlen** rather than **wcslen**, if a subsequent call to **wcsrtombs_s** were used instead of **wcstombs_s**.

In C++, using these functions is simplified by template overloads; the overloads can infer buffer length automatically (eliminating the need to specify a size argument) and they can automatically replace older, non-secure functions with their newer, secure counterparts. For more information, see [Secure Template Overloads](../../c-runtime-library/secure-template-overloads.md).

## Exceptions

The **wcsrtombs_s** function is multithread safe as long as no function in the current thread calls **setlocale** while this function is executing and the *mbstate* is null.

## Example

```cpp
// crt_wcsrtombs_s.cpp
//
// This code example converts a wide
// character string into a multibyte
// character string.
//

#include <stdio.h>
#include <memory.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <errno.h>

#define MB_BUFFER_SIZE 100

void main()
{
    const wchar_t   wcString[] =
                    {L"Every good boy does fine."};
    const wchar_t   *wcsIndirectString = wcString;
    char            mbString[MB_BUFFER_SIZE];
    size_t          countConverted;
    errno_t         err;
    mbstate_t       mbstate;

    // Reset to initial shift state
    ::memset((void*)&mbstate, 0, sizeof(mbstate));

    err = wcsrtombs_s(&countConverted, mbString, MB_BUFFER_SIZE,
                      &wcsIndirectString, MB_BUFFER_SIZE, &mbstate);
    if (err == EILSEQ)
    {
        printf( "An encoding error was detected in the string.\n" );
    }
    else
    {
        printf( "The string was successfully converted.\n" );
    }
}
```

```Output
The string was successfully converted.
```
