# `trunc`, `truncf`, `truncl`

Determines the nearest integer that is less than or equal to the specified floating-point value.

## Syntax

```C
double trunc( double x );
long double truncl( long double x );
#define trunc(X) // Requires C11 or later

long double trunc( long double x ); //C++ only
float trunc( float x ); //C++ only
```

### Parameters

*`x`*\
The value to truncate.

## Return value

If successful, the functions return an integer value of *`x`*, rounded towards zero.

Otherwise, the functions may return one of the following values:

| Issue | Return |
|---|---|
| *`x`* = ±INFINITY | x |
| *`x`* =  ±0 | x |
| *`x`* = NaN | NaN |

Errors are reported as specified in [`_matherr`](matherr.md).

## Remarks

Because C++ allows overloading, you can call overloads of **`trunc`** that take and return **`float`** and **`long double`** types. In a C program, unless you're using the \<tgmath.h> macro to call this function, **`trunc`** always takes and returns a **`double`**.

If you use the \<tgmath.h> `trunc()` macro, the type of the argument determines which version of the function is selected. See [Type-generic math](../tgmath.md) for details.

Because the largest floating-point values are exact integers, this function won't overflow on its own. However, you may cause the function to overflow by returning a value into an integer type.

You can also round down by implicitly converting from floating-point to integral; however, doing so is limited to the values that can be stored in the target type.

## Requirements

| Function | C header | C++ header |
|---|---|---|
| **`trunc`**, **`truncf`**, **`truncl`** | \<math.h> | \<cmath> |
| **`trunc`** macro | \<tgmath.h> |  |
