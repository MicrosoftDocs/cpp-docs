# _snscanf_s, _snscanf_s_l, _snwscanf_s, _snwscanf_s_l

Reads formatted data of a specified length from a string. These are versions of [_snscanf, _snscanf_l, _snwscanf, _snwscanf_l](snscanf-snscanf-l-snwscanf-snwscanf-l.md) with security enhancements as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).

## Syntax

```C
int __cdecl _snscanf_s(
   const char * input,
   size_t length,
   const char * format [, argument_list]
);
int __cdecl _snscanf_s_l(
   const char * input,
   size_t length,
   const char * format,
   locale_t locale [, argument_list]
);
int __cdecl _snwscanf_s(
   const wchar_t * input,
   size_t length,
   const wchar_t * format [, argument_list]
);
int __cdecl _snwscanf_s_l(
   const wchar_t * input,
   size_t length,
   const wchar_t * format,
   locale_t locale [, argument_list]
);
```

### Parameters

*input*<br/>
Input string to examine.

*length*<br/>
Number of characters to examine in *input*.

*format*<br/>
One or more format specifiers.

*locale*<br/>
The locale to use.

*argument_list*<br/>
Optional arguments to be assigned according to the format string.

## Return Value

Both of these functions returns the number of fields successfully converted and assigned; the return value does not include fields that were read but not assigned. A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned. The return value is **EOF** for an error or if the end of the string is reached before the first conversion. For more information, see [sscanf_s, _sscanf_s_l, swscanf_s, _swscanf_s_l](sscanf-s-sscanf-s-l-swscanf-s-swscanf-s-l.md).

If *input* or *format* is a **NULL** pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return **EOF** and set **errno** to **EINVAL**.

For information about these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Remarks

This function is like **sscanf_s** except that it provides the ability to specify a fixed number of characters to examine from the input string. For more information, see [sscanf_s, _sscanf_s_l, swscanf_s, _swscanf_s_l](sscanf-s-sscanf-s-l-swscanf-s-swscanf-s-l.md).

The buffer size parameter is required with the type field characters **c**, **C**, **s**, **S**, and **[**. For more information, see [scanf Type Field Characters](../../c-runtime-library/scanf-type-field-characters.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The size parameter is of type **unsigned**, not **size_t**.

The versions of these functions with the **_l** suffix are identical except that they use the locale parameter passed in instead of the current thread locale.

### Generic-Text Routine Mappings

|Tchar.h routine|_UNICODE and _MBCS not defined|_MBCS defined|_UNICODE defined|
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
|**_sntscanf_s**|**_snscanf_s**|**_snscanf_s**|**_snwscanf_s**|
|**_sntscanf_s_l**|**_snscanf_s_l**|**_snscanf_s_l**|**_snwscanf_s_l**|

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**_snscanf_s**, **_snscanf_s_l**|\<stdio.h>|
|**_snwscanf_s**, **_snwscanf_s_l**|\<stdio.h> or \<wchar.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_snscanf_s.c
// This example scans a string of
// numbers, using both the character
// and wide character secure versions
// of the snscanf function.

#include <stdio.h>

int main( )
{
    char        str1[] = "15 12 14...";
    wchar_t     str2[] = L"15 12 14...";
    char        s1[3];
    wchar_t     s2[3];
    int         i;
    float       fp;

    i = _snscanf_s( str1, 6,  "%s %f", s1, 3, &fp);
    printf_s("_snscanf_s converted %d fields: ", i);
    printf_s("%s and %f\n", s1, fp);

    i = _snwscanf_s( str2, 6,  L"%s %f", s2, 3, &fp);
    wprintf_s(L"_snwscanf_s converted %d fields: ", i);
    wprintf_s(L"%s and %f\n", s2, fp);
}
```

```Output
_snscanf_s converted 2 fields: 15 and 12.000000
_snwscanf_s converted 2 fields: 15 and 12.000000
```
