# _CrtSetDumpClient

Installs an application-defined function to dump **_CLIENT_BLOCK** type memory blocks (debug version only).

## Syntax

```C
_CRT_DUMP_CLIENT _CrtSetDumpClient( _CRT_DUMP_CLIENT dumpClient );
```

### Parameters

*dumpClient*<br/>
New client-defined memory dump function to hook into the C run-time debug memory dump process.

## Return Value

Returns the previously defined client block dump function.

## Remarks

The **_CrtSetDumpClient** function allows the application to hook its own function to dump objects stored in **_CLIENT_BLOCK** memory blocks into the C run-time debug memory dump process. As a result, every time a debug dump function such as [_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince](crtmemdumpallobjectssince.md) or [_CrtDumpMemoryLeaks](crtdumpmemoryleaks.md) dumps a **_CLIENT_BLOCK** memory block, the application's dump function is called as well. **_CrtSetDumpClient** provides an application with an easy method for detecting memory leaks and validating or reporting the contents of data stored in **_CLIENT_BLOCK** blocks. When [_DEBUG](../../c-runtime-library/debug.md) is not defined, calls to **_CrtSetDumpClient** are removed during preprocessing.

The **_CrtSetDumpClient** function installs the new application-defined dump function specified in *dumpClient* and returns the previously defined dump function. An example of a client block dump function is as follows:

```C
void DumpClientFunction( void *userPortion, size_t blockSize );
```

The *userPortion* argument is a pointer to the beginning of the user data portion of the memory block and *blockSize* specifies the size of the allocated memory block in bytes. The client block dump function must return **void**. The pointer to the client dump function that is passed to **_CrtSetDumpClient** is of type **_CRT_DUMP_CLIENT**, as defined in Crtdbg.h:

```C
typedef void (__cdecl *_CRT_DUMP_CLIENT)( void *, size_t );
```

For more information about functions that operate on **_CLIENT_BLOCK** type memory blocks, see [Client Block Hook Functions](/visualstudio/debugger/client-block-hook-functions). The [_CrtReportBlockType](crtreportblocktype.md) function can be used to return information about block types and subtypes.

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**_CrtSetDumpClient**|\<crtdbg.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Libraries

Debug versions of [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md) only.
