# _chdrive

Changes the current working drive.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

## Syntax

```C
int _chdrive(
   int drive
);
```

### Parameters

*drive*<br/>
An integer from 1 through 26 that specifies the current working drive (1=A, 2=B, and so forth).

## Return Value

Zero (0) if the current working drive was changed successfully; otherwise, -1.

## Remarks

If *drive* is not in the range from 1 through 26, the invalid-parameter handler is invoked as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, the **_chdrive** function returns -1, **errno** is set to **EACCES**, and **_doserrno** is set to **ERROR_INVALID_DRIVE**.

The **_chdrive** function is not thread-safe because it depends on the **SetCurrentDirectory** function, which is itself not thread-safe. To use **_chdrive** safely in a multi-threaded application, you must provide your own thread synchronization. For more information, see [SetCurrentDirectory](/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setcurrentdirectory).

The **_chdrive** function changes only the current working drive;  **_chdir** changes the current working directory.

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**_chdrive**|\<direct.h>|

For more information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Example

See the example for [_getdrive](getdrive.md).
