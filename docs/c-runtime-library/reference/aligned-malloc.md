# _aligned_malloc

Allocates memory on a specified alignment boundary.

## Syntax

```C
void * _aligned_malloc(
    size_t size,
    size_t alignment
);
```

### Parameters

*size*<br/>
Size of the requested memory allocation.

*alignment*<br/>
The alignment value, which must be an integer power of 2.

## Return Value

A pointer to the memory block that was allocated or NULL if the operation failed. The pointer is a multiple of *alignment*.

## Remarks

**_aligned_malloc** is based on [malloc](malloc.md).

**_aligned_malloc** is marked `__declspec(noalias)` and `__declspec(restrict)`, meaning that the function is guaranteed not to modify global variables and that the pointer returned is not aliased. For more information, see [noalias](../../cpp/noalias.md) and [restrict](../../cpp/restrict.md).

This function sets `errno` to `ENOMEM` if the memory allocation failed or if the requested size was greater than `_HEAP_MAXREQ`. For more information about `errno`, see [errno, _doserrno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md). Also, **_aligned_malloc** validates its parameters. If *alignment* is not a power of 2 or *size* is zero, this function invokes the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function returns NULL and sets `errno` to `EINVAL`.

Use [_aligned_free](aligned-free.md) to deallocate memory obtained by both **_aligned_malloc** and `_aligned_offset_malloc`. Don't use `free`, which doesn't reclaim the aligned memory correctly and can lead to hard-to-diagnose bugs.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**_aligned_malloc**|\<malloc.h>|

## Example

```C
// crt_aligned_malloc.c

#include <malloc.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    void    *ptr;
    size_t  alignment,
            off_set;

    // Note alignment should be 2^N where N is any positive int.
    alignment = 16;
    off_set = 5;

    // Using _aligned_malloc
    ptr = _aligned_malloc(100, alignment);
    if (ptr == NULL)
    {
        printf_s( "Error allocation aligned memory.");
        return -1;
    }
    if (((unsigned long long)ptr % alignment ) == 0)
        printf_s( "This pointer, %p, is aligned on %zu\n",
                  ptr, alignment);
    else
        printf_s( "This pointer, %p, is not aligned on %zu\n",
                  ptr, alignment);

    // Using _aligned_realloc
    ptr = _aligned_realloc(ptr, 200, alignment);
    if ( ((unsigned long long)ptr % alignment ) == 0)
        printf_s( "This pointer, %p, is aligned on %zu\n",
                  ptr, alignment);
    else
        printf_s( "This pointer, %p, is not aligned on %zu\n",
                  ptr, alignment);
    _aligned_free(ptr);

    // Using _aligned_offset_malloc
    ptr = _aligned_offset_malloc(200, alignment, off_set);
    if (ptr == NULL)
    {
        printf_s( "Error allocation aligned offset memory.");
        return -1;
    }
    if ( ( (((unsigned long long)ptr) + off_set) % alignment ) == 0)
        printf_s( "This pointer, %p, is offset by %zu on alignment of %zu\n",
                  ptr, off_set, alignment);
    else
        printf_s( "This pointer, %p, does not satisfy offset %zu "
                  "and alignment %zu\n",ptr, off_set, alignment);

    // Using _aligned_offset_realloc
    ptr = _aligned_offset_realloc(ptr, 200, alignment, off_set);
    if (ptr == NULL)
    {
        printf_s( "Error reallocation aligned offset memory.");
        return -1;
    }
    if ( ( (((unsigned long long)ptr) + off_set) % alignment ) == 0)
        printf_s( "This pointer, %p, is offset by %zu on alignment of %zu\n",
                  ptr, off_set, alignment);
    else
        printf_s( "This pointer, %p, does not satisfy offset %zu and "
                  "alignment %zu\n", ptr, off_set, alignment);

    // Note that _aligned_free works for both _aligned_malloc
    // and _aligned_offset_malloc. Using free is illegal.
    _aligned_free(ptr);
}
```

```Output
This pointer, 3280880, is aligned on 16
This pointer, 3280880, is aligned on 16
This pointer, 3280891, is offset by 5 on alignment of 16
This pointer, 3280891, is offset by 5 on alignment of 16
```
