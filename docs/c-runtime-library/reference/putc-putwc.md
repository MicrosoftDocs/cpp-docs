# putc, putwc

Writes a character to a stream.

## Syntax

```C
int putc(
   int c,
   FILE *stream
);
wint_t putwc(
   wchar_t c,
   FILE *stream
);
```

### Parameters

*c*<br/>
Character to be written.

*stream*<br/>
Pointer to **FILE** structure.

## Return Value

Returns the character written. To indicate an error or end-of-file condition, **putc** and **putchar** return **EOF`; **putwc` and **putwchar** return **WEOF**. For all four routines, use [ferror](ferror.md) or [feof](feof.md) to check for an error or end of file. If passed a null pointer for *stream*, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return **EOF** or **WEOF** and set **errno** to **EINVAL**.

See [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md) for more information on these, and other, error codes.

## Remarks

The **putc** routine writes the single character *c* to the output *stream* at the current position. Any integer can be passed to **putc**, but only the lower 8 bits are written. The **putchar** routine is identical to `putc( c, stdout )`. For each routine, if a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set. **putc** and **putchar** are similar to **fputc** and **_fputchar**, respectively, but are implemented both as functions and as macros (see [Choosing Between Functions and Macros](../../c-runtime-library/recommendations-for-choosing-between-functions-and-macros.md)). **putwc** and **putwchar** are wide-character versions of **putc** and **putchar**, respectively. **putwc** and **putc** behave identically if the stream is opened in ANSI mode. **putc** doesn't currently support output into a UNICODE stream.

The versions with the **_nolock** suffix are identical except that they are not protected from interference by other threads. For more information, see **_putc_nolock, _putwc_nolock**.

### Generic-Text Routine Mappings

|TCHAR.H routine|_UNICODE & _MBCS not defined|_MBCS defined|_UNICODE defined|
|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
|**_puttc**|**putc**|**putc**|**putwc**|

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**putc**|\<stdio.h>|
|**putwc**|\<stdio.h> or \<wchar.h>|

The console is not supported in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. The standard stream handles that are associated with the console, **stdin**, **stdout**, and **stderr**, must be redirected before C run-time functions can use them in UWP apps. For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_putc.c
/* This program uses putc to write buffer
* to a stream. If an error occurs, the program
* stops before writing the entire buffer.
*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main( void )
{
   FILE *stream;
   char *p, buffer[] = "This is the line of output\n";
   int  ch;

   ch = 0;
   /* Make standard out the stream and write to it. */
   stream = stdout;
   for( p = buffer; (ch != EOF) && (*p != '\0'); p++ )
      ch = putc( *p, stream );
}
```

### Output

```Output
This is the line of output
```
