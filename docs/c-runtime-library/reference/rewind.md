# rewind

Repositions the file pointer to the beginning of a file.

## Syntax

```C
void rewind(
   FILE *stream
);
```

### Parameters

*stream*<br/>
Pointer to **FILE** structure.

## Remarks

The **rewind** function repositions the file pointer associated with *stream* to the beginning of the file. A call to **rewind** is similar to

**(void) fseek(** _stream_**, 0L, SEEK_SET );**

However, unlike [fseek](fseek-fseeki64.md), **rewind** clears the error indicators for the stream as well as the end-of-file indicator. Also, unlike [fseek](fseek-fseeki64.md), **rewind** does not return a value to indicate whether the pointer was successfully moved.

To clear the keyboard buffer, use **rewind** with the stream **stdin**, which is associated with the keyboard by default.

If stream is a **NULL** pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function returns and **errno** is set to **EINVAL**.

For information on these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**rewind**|\<stdio.h>|

For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_rewind.c
/* This program first opens a file named
* crt_rewind.out for input and output and writes two
* integers to the file. Next, it uses rewind to
* reposition the file pointer to the beginning of
* the file and reads the data back in.
*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main( void )
{
   FILE *stream;
   int data1, data2;

   data1 = 1;
   data2 = -37;

   fopen_s( &stream, "crt_rewind.out", "w+" );
   if( stream != NULL )
   {
      fprintf( stream, "%d %d", data1, data2 );
      printf( "The values written are: %d and %d\n", data1, data2 );
      rewind( stream );
      fscanf_s( stream, "%d %d", &data1, &data2 );
      printf( "The values read are: %d and %d\n", data1, data2 );
      fclose( stream );
   }
}
```

### Output

```Output
The values written are: 1 and -37
The values read are: 1 and -37
```
