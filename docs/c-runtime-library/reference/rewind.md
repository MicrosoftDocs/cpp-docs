# rewind
Repositions the file pointer to the beginning of a file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      void rewind(  
   FILE *stream   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `stream`  
 Pointer to **FILE** structure.  
  
## Remarks  
 The **rewind** function repositions the file pointer associated with `stream` to the beginning of the file. A call to **rewind** is similar to  
  
 **(void) fseek(** `stream`**, 0L,** `SEEK_SET` **);**  
  
 However, unlike `fseek`, **rewind** clears the error indicators for the stream as well as the end-of-file indicator. Also, unlike `fseek`, **rewind** does not return a value to indicate whether the pointer was successfully moved.  
  
 To clear the keyboard buffer, use **rewind** with the stream `stdin`, which is associated with the keyboard by default.  
  
 If stream is a `NULL` pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, this function returns and `errno` is set to `EINVAL`.  
  
 For information on these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Routine|Required header|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|**rewind**|\<stdio.h>|  
  
 For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  
  
## Libraries  
 All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// crt_rewind.c  
/* This program first opens a file named  
 * crt_rewind.out for input and output and writes two  
 * integers to the file. Next, it uses rewind to  
 * reposition the file pointer to the beginning of  
 * the file and reads the data back in.  
 */  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   FILE *stream;  
   int data1, data2;  
  
   data1 = 1;  
   data2 = -37;  
  
   fopen_s( &stream, "crt_rewind.out", "w+" );  
   if( stream != NULL )  
   {  
      fprintf( stream, "%d %d", data1, data2 );  
      printf( "The values written are: %d and %d\n", data1, data2 );  
      rewind( stream );  
      fscanf_s( stream, "%d %d", &data1, &data2 );  
      printf( "The values read are: %d and %d\n", data1, data2 );  
      fclose( stream );  
   }  
}  
```  
  
## Output  
  
```  
The values written are: 1 and -37  
The values read are: 1 and -37  
```  
  
## .NET Framework Equivalent  
 Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`. For more information, see [Platform Invoke Examples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/15926806-f0b7-487e-93a6-4e9367ec689f).
