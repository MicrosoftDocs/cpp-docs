# _pclose

Waits for a new command processor and closes the stream on the associated pipe.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

## Syntax

```C
int _pclose(
FILE *stream
);
```

### Parameters

*stream*<br/>
Return value from the previous call to **_popen**.

## Return Value

Returns the exit status of the terminating command processor, or -1 if an error occurs. The format of the return value is the same as that for **_cwait**, except the low-order and high-order bytes are swapped. If stream is **NULL**, **_pclose** sets **errno** to **EINVAL** and returns -1.

For information about these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).

## Remarks

The **_pclose** function looks up the process ID of the command processor (Cmd.exe) started by the associated **_popen** call, executes a [_cwait](cwait.md) call on the new command processor, and closes the stream on the associated pipe.

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|
|-------------|---------------------|
|**_pclose**|\<stdio.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).
