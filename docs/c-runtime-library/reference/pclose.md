# _pclose
Waits for a new command processor and closes the stream on the associated pipe.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported with /ZW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj606124.aspx).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      int _pclose(  
FILE *stream   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `stream`  
 Return value from the previous call to `_popen`.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns the exit status of the terminating command processor, or –1 if an error occurs. The format of the return value is the same as that for `_cwait`, except the low-order and high-order bytes are swapped. If stream is **NULL**, `_pclose` sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns -1.  
  
 For information about these and other error codes, see [_doserrno, errno, _sys_errlist, and _sys_nerr](../../c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 The `_pclose` function looks up the process ID of the command processor (Cmd.exe) started by the associated `_popen` call, executes a [_cwait](../../c-runtime-library/reference/cwait.md) call on the new command processor, and closes the stream on the associated pipe.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Routine|Required header|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|`_pclose`|\<stdio.h>|  
  
 For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).  
  
## Libraries  
 All versions of the [C run-time libraries](../../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).  
  
## .NET Framework Equivalent  
 Not applicable. To call the standard C function, use `PInvoke`. For more information, see [Platform Invoke Examples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/15926806-f0b7-487e-93a6-4e9367ec689f).
