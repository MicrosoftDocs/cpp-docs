# _heapwalk

Traverses the heap and returns information about the next entry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime except in Debug builds. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

## Syntax

```C
int _heapwalk( _HEAPINFO *entryinfo );
```

### Parameters

*entryinfo*<br/>
Buffer to contain heap information.

## Return Value

**_heapwalk** returns one of the following integer manifest constants defined in Malloc.h.

|Return value|Meaning|
|-|-|
|**_HEAPBADBEGIN**| Initial header information invalid or not found.|
|**_HEAPBADNODE**| Heap damaged or bad node found.|
|**_HEAPBADPTR**| The **_pentry** field of the **_HEAPINFO** structure does not contain a valid pointer into the heap or *entryinfo* is a null pointer.|
|**_HEAPEND**| End of the heap reached successfully.|
|**_HEAPEMPTY**| Heap not initialized.|
|**_HEAPOK**| No errors so far; *entryinfo* is updated with information about the next heap entry.|

In addition, if an error occurs, **_heapwalk** sets **errno** to **ENOSYS**.

## Remarks

The **_heapwalk** function helps debug heap-related problems in programs. The function walks through the heap, traversing one entry per call, and returns a pointer to a structure of type **_HEAPINFO** that contains information about the next heap entry. The **_HEAPINFO** type, defined in Malloc.h, contains the following elements.

|Field|Meaning|
|-|-|
|`int *_pentry`|Heap entry pointer.|
|`size_t _size`|Size of the heap entry.|
|`int _useflag`|Flag that indicates whether the heap entry is in use.|

A call to **_heapwalk** that returns **_HEAPOK** stores the size of the entry in the **_size** field and sets the **_useflag** field to either **_FREEENTRY** or **_USEDENTRY** (both are constants defined in Malloc.h). To obtain this information about the first entry in the heap, pass **_heapwalk** a pointer to a **_HEAPINFO** structure whose **_pentry** member is **NULL**. If the operating system does not support **_heapwalk**(for example, Windows 98), the function returns **_HEAPEND** and sets **errno** to **ENOSYS**.

This function validates its parameter. If *entryinfo* is a null pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, **errno** is set to **EINVAL** and the function returns **_HEAPBADPTR**.

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|Optional header|
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|**_heapwalk**|\<malloc.h>|\<errno.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_heapwalk.c

// This program "walks" the heap, starting
// at the beginning (_pentry = NULL). It prints out each
// heap entry's use, location, and size. It also prints
// out information about the overall state of the heap as
// soon as _heapwalk returns a value other than _HEAPOK
// or if the loop has iterated 100 times.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>

void heapdump(void);

int main(void)
{
    char *buffer;

    heapdump();
    if((buffer = (char *)malloc(59)) != NULL)
    {
        heapdump();
        free(buffer);
    }
    heapdump();
}

void heapdump(void)
{
    _HEAPINFO hinfo;
    int heapstatus;
    int numLoops;
    hinfo._pentry = NULL;
    numLoops = 0;
    while((heapstatus = _heapwalk(&hinfo)) == _HEAPOK &&
          numLoops < 100)
    {
        printf("%8s block at %Fp of size %4.4X\n",
               (hinfo._useflag == _USEDENTRY ? "USED" : "FREE"),
               hinfo._pentry, hinfo._size);
        numLoops++;
    }

    switch(heapstatus)
    {
    case _HEAPEMPTY:
        printf("OK - empty heap\n");
        break;
    case _HEAPEND:
        printf("OK - end of heap\n");
        break;
    case _HEAPBADPTR:
        printf("ERROR - bad pointer to heap\n");
        break;
    case _HEAPBADBEGIN:
        printf("ERROR - bad start of heap\n");
        break;
    case _HEAPBADNODE:
        printf("ERROR - bad node in heap\n");
        break;
    }
}
```
