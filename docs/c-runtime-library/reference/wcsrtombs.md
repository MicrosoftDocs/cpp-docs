# wcsrtombs

Convert a wide character string to its multibyte character string representation. A more secure version of this function is available; see [wcsrtombs_s](wcsrtombs-s.md).

## Syntax

```C
size_t wcsrtombs(
   char *mbstr,
   const wchar_t **wcstr,
   sizeof count,
   mbstate_t *mbstate
);
template <size_t size>
size_t wcsrtombs(
   char (&mbstr)[size],
   const wchar_t **wcstr,
   sizeof count,
   mbstate_t *mbstate
); // C++ only
```

### Parameters

*mbstr*<br/>
The resulting converted multibyte character string's address location.

*wcstr*<br/>
Indirectly points to the location of the wide character string to be converted.

*count*<br/>
The number of character to be converted.

*mbstate*<br/>
A pointer to an **mbstate_t** conversion state object.

## Return Value

Returns the number of bytes successfully converted, not including the null terminating null byte (if any), otherwise a -1 if an error occurred.

## Remarks

The **wcsrtombs** function converts a string of wide characters, beginning in the specified conversion state contained in *mbstate*, from the values indirect pointed to in *wcstr*, into the address of *mbstr*. The conversion will continue for each character until: after a null terminating wide character is encountered, when a non corresponding character is encountered or when the next character would exceed the limit contained in *count*. If **wcsrtombs** encounters the wide-character null character (L'\0') either before or when *count* occurs, it converts it to an 8-bit 0 and stops.

Thus, the multibyte character string at *mbstr* is null-terminated only if **wcsrtombs** encounters a wide character null character during conversion. If the sequences pointed to by *wcstr* and *mbstr* overlap, the behavior of **wcsrtombs** is undefined. **wcsrtombs** is affected by the LC_TYPE category of the current locale.

The **wcsrtombs** function differs from [wcstombs, _wcstombs_l](wcstombs-wcstombs-l.md) by its restartability. The conversion state is stored in *mbstate* for subsequent calls to the same or other restartable functions. Results are undefined when mixing the use of restartable and nonrestartable functions.  For example, an application would use **wcsrlen** rather than **wcsnlen**, if a subsequent call to **wcsrtombs** were used instead of **wcstombs**.

If the *mbstr* argument is **NULL**, **wcsrtombs** returns the required size in bytes of the destination string. If *mbstate* is null, the internal **mbstate_t** conversion state is used. If the character sequence *wchar* does not have a corresponding multibyte character representation, a -1 is returned and the **errno** is set to **EILSEQ**.

In C++, this function has a template overload that invokes the newer, secure counterpart of this function. For more information, see [Secure Template Overloads](../../c-runtime-library/secure-template-overloads.md).

## Exceptions

The **wcsrtombs** function is multithread safe as long as no function in the current thread calls **setlocale** while this function is executing and the *mbstate* is not null.

## Example

```cpp
// crt_wcsrtombs.cpp
// compile with: /W3
// This code example converts a wide
// character string into a multibyte
// character string.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <memory.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <errno.h>

#define MB_BUFFER_SIZE 100

int main()
{
    const wchar_t   wcString[] =
                    {L"Every good boy does fine."};
    const wchar_t   *wcsIndirectString = wcString;
    char            mbString[MB_BUFFER_SIZE];
    size_t          countConverted;
    mbstate_t       mbstate;

    // Reset to initial shift state
    ::memset((void*)&mbstate, 0, sizeof(mbstate));

    countConverted = wcsrtombs(mbString, &wcsIndirectString,
                               MB_BUFFER_SIZE, &mbstate); // C4996
    // Note: wcsrtombs is deprecated; consider using wcsrtombs_s
    if (errno == EILSEQ)
    {
        printf( "An encoding error was detected in the string.\n" );
    }
    else
    {
        printf( "The string was successfuly converted.\n" );
    }
}
```

```Output
The string was successfuly converted.
```
