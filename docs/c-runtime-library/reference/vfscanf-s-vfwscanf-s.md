# vfscanf_s, vfwscanf_s

Reads formatted data from a stream. These versions of vfscanf, vfwscanf have security enhancements, as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).

## Syntax

```C
int vfscanf_s(
   FILE *stream,
   const char *format,
   va_list arglist
);
int vfwscanf_s(
   FILE *stream,
   const wchar_t *format,
   va_list arglist
);

```

### Parameters

*stream*<br/>
Pointer to **FILE** structure.

*format*<br/>
Format-control string.

*arglist*<br/>
Variable argument list.

## Return Value

Each of these functions returns the number of fields that are successfully converted and assigned; the return value does not include fields that were read but not assigned. A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned. If an error occurs, or if the end of the file stream is reached before the first conversion, the return value is **EOF** for **vfscanf_s** and **vfwscanf_s**.

These functions validate their parameters. If *stream* is an invalid file pointer, or *format* is a null pointer, these functions invoke the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return **EOF** and set **errno** to **EINVAL**.

## Remarks

The **vfscanf_s** function reads data from the current position of *stream* into the locations that are given by the *arglist* argument list (if any). Each argument in the list must be a pointer to a variable of a type that corresponds to a type specifier in *format*. *format* controls the interpretation of the input fields and has the same form and function as the *format* argument for **scanf_s**; see [Format Specification Fields: scanf and wscanf Functions](../../c-runtime-library/format-specification-fields-scanf-and-wscanf-functions.md) for a description of *format*. **vfwscanf_s** is a wide-character version of **vfscanf_s**; the format argument to **vfwscanf_s** is a wide-character string. These functions behave identically if the stream is opened in ANSI mode. **vfscanf_s** doesn't currently support input from a UNICODE stream.

The main difference between the more secure functions (that have the **_s** suffix) and the other versions is that the more secure functions require the size in characters of each **c**, **C**, **s**, **S**, and **[** type field to be passed as an argument immediately following the variable. For more information, see [scanf_s, _scanf_s_l, wscanf_s, _wscanf_s_l](scanf-s-scanf-s-l-wscanf-s-wscanf-s-l.md) and [scanf Width Specification](../../c-runtime-library/scanf-width-specification.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The size parameter is of type **unsigned**, not **size_t**.

### Generic-Text Routine Mappings

|TCHAR.H routine|_UNICODE & _MBCS not defined|_MBCS defined|_UNICODE defined|
|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
|**_vftscanf_s**|**vfscanf_s**|**vfscanf_s**|**vfwscanf_s**|

## Requirements

|Function|Required header|
|--------------|---------------------|
|**vfscanf_s**|\<stdio.h>|
|**vfwscanf_s**|\<stdio.h> or \<wchar.h>|

For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).

## Example

```C
// crt_vfscanf_s.c
// compile with: /W3
// This program writes formatted
// data to a file. It then uses vfscanf_s to
// read the various data back from the file.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

FILE *stream;

int call_vfscanf_s(FILE * istream, char * format, ...)
{
    int result;
    va_list arglist;
    va_start(arglist, format);
    result = vfscanf_s(istream, format, arglist);
    va_end(arglist);
    return result;
}

int main(void)
{
    long l;
    float fp;
    char s[81];
    char c;

    if (fopen_s(&stream, "vfscanf_s.out", "w+") != 0)
    {
        printf("The file vfscanf_s.out was not opened\n");
    }
    else
    {
        fprintf(stream, "%s %ld %f%c", "a-string",
            65000, 3.14159, 'x');
        // Security caution!
        // Beware loading data from a file without confirming its size,
        // as it may lead to a buffer overrun situation.

        // Set pointer to beginning of file:
        fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET);

        // Read data back from file:
        call_vfscanf_s(stream, "%s %ld %f%c", s, _countof(s), &l, &fp, &c, 1);

        // Output data read:
        printf("%s\n", s);
        printf("%ld\n", l);
        printf("%f\n", fp);
        printf("%c\n", c);

        fclose(stream);
    }
}

```

```Output
a-string
65000
3.141590
x
```
