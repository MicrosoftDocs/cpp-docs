# _commit

Flushes a file directly to disk.

## Syntax

```C
int _commit(
   int fd
);
```

### Parameters

*fd*<br/>
File descriptor referring to the open file.

## Return Value

**_commit** returns 0 if the file was successfully flushed to disk. A return value of -1 indicates an error.

## Remarks

The **_commit** function forces the operating system to write the file associated with *fd* to disk. This call ensures that the specified file is flushed immediately, not at the operating system's discretion.

If *fd* is an invalid file descriptor, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, the function returns -1 and **errno** is set to **EBADF**.

## Requirements

|Routine|Required header|Optional headers|
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
|**_commit**|\<io.h>|\<errno.h>|

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md).
