# _CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince

Dumps information about objects in the heap from the start of program execution or from a specified heap state (debug version only).

## Syntax

```C
void _CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince(
   const _CrtMemState *state
);
```

### Parameters

*state*<br/>
Pointer to the heap state to begin dumping from or **NULL**.

## Remarks

The **_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince** function dumps the debug header information of objects allocated in the heap in a user-readable form. The dump information can be used by the application to track allocations and detect memory problems. When [_DEBUG](../../c-runtime-library/debug.md) is not defined, calls to **_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince** are removed during preprocessing.

**_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince** uses the value of the *state* parameter to determine where to initiate the dump operation. To begin dumping from a specified heap state, the *state* parameter must be a pointer to a **_CrtMemState** structure that has been filled in by [_CrtMemCheckpoint](crtmemcheckpoint.md) before **_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince** was called. When *state* is **NULL**, the function begins the dump from the start of program execution.

If the application has installed a dump hook function by calling [_CrtSetDumpClient](crtsetdumpclient.md), then every time **_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince** dumps information about a **_CLIENT_BLOCK** type of block, it calls the application-supplied dump function as well. By default, internal C run-time blocks (**_CRT_BLOCK**) are not included in memory dump operations. The [_CrtSetDbgFlag](crtsetdbgflag.md) function can be used to turn on the **_CRTDBG_CHECK_CRT_DF** bit of **_crtDbgFlag** to include these blocks. In addition, blocks marked as freed or ignored (**_FREE_BLOCK**, **_IGNORE_BLOCK**) are not included in the memory dump.

For more information about heap state functions and the **_CrtMemState** structure, see [Heap State Reporting Functions](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debug-heap-details). For more information about how memory blocks are allocated, initialized, and managed in the debug version of the base heap, see [CRT Debug Heap Details](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debug-heap-details).
