# `nextafter`, `nextafterf`, `nextafterl`, `_nextafter`, `_nextafterf`, `nexttoward`, `nexttowardf`, `nexttowardl`

Returns the next representable floating-point value.

## Syntax

```C
double nextafter( double x, double y );
float nextafterf( float x, float y );
long double nextafterl( long double x, long double y );

double _nextafter( double x, double y );
float _nextafterf( float x, float y ); /* x64 only */

#define nextafter(X, Y) // Requires C11 or later

double nexttoward( double x, long double y );
float nexttowardf( float x, long double y );
long double nexttowardl( long double x, long double y );

#define nexttoward(X, Y) // Requires C11 or later

float nextafter( float x, float y ); /* C++ only, requires <cmath> */
long double nextafter( long double x, long double y ); /* C++ only, requires <cmath> */

float nexttoward( float x, long double y ); /* C++ only, requires <cmath> */
long double nexttoward( long double x, long double y ); /* C++ only, requires <cmath> */
```

### Parameters

*`x`*\
The floating-point value to start from.

*`y`*\
The floating-point value to go towards.

## Return value

Returns the next representable floating-point value of the return type after *`x`* in the direction of *`y`*. If *`x`* and *`y`* are equal, the function returns *`y`*, converted to the return type, with no exception triggered. If *`x`* isn't equal to *`y`*, and the result is a denormal or zero, the `FE_UNDERFLOW` and `FE_INEXACT` floating-point exception states are set, and the correct result is returned. If either *`x`* or *`y`* is a NAN, then the return value is one of the input NANs. If *`x`* is finite and the result is infinite or not representable in the type, a correctly signed infinity or NAN is returned, the `FE_OVERFLOW` and `FE_INEXACT` floating-point exception states are set, and `errno` is set to `ERANGE`.

## Remarks

The **`nextafter`** and **`nexttoward`** function families are equivalent, except for the parameter type of *`y`*. If *`x`* and *`y`* are equal, the value returned is *`y`* converted to the return type.

Because C++ allows overloading, if you include `<cmath>` you can call overloads of **`nextafter`** and **`nexttoward`** that return **`float`** and **`long double`** types. In a C program, unless you're using the `<tgmath.h>` macro to call this function, **`nextafter`** and **`nexttoward`** always return **`double`**.

If you use the `nextafter` or `nexttoward` macro from `<tgmath.h>`, the type of the argument determines which version of the function is selected. See [Type-generic math](../tgmath.md) for details.

The **`_nextafter`** and **`_nextafterf`** functions are Microsoft-specific. The **`_nextafterf`** function is only available when compiling for x64.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](../global-state.md).

## Requirements

| Routine | Required header (C) | Required header (C++) |
|---|---|---|
| **`nextafter`**, **`nextafterf`**, **`nextafterl`**, **`_nextafterf`**, **`nexttoward`**, **`nexttowardf`**, **`nexttowardl`** | `<math.h>` | `<math.h>` or `<cmath>` |
| **`_nextafter`** | `<float.h>` | `<float.h>` or `<cfloat>` |
| **`nextafter`** macro,  **`nexttoward`** macro | `<tgmath.h>` |  |
