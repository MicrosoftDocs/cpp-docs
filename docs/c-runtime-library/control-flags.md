# Control Flags

The debug version of the Microsoft C run-time library uses the following flags to control the heap allocation and reporting process. For more information, see [CRT Debugging Techniques](/visualstudio/debugger/crt-debugging-techniques).

|Flag|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC](../c-runtime-library/crtdbg-map-alloc.md)|Maps the base heap functions to their debug version counterparts|
|[_DEBUG](../c-runtime-library/debug.md)|Enables the use of the debugging versions of the run-time functions|
|[_crtDbgFlag](../c-runtime-library/crtdbgflag.md)|Controls how the debug heap manager tracks allocations|

These flags can be defined with a /D command-line option or with a `#define` directive. When the flag is defined with `#define`, the directive must appear before the header file include statement for the routine declarations.
