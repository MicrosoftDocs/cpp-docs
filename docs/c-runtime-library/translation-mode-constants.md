# Translation mode constants

## Syntax

```C
#include <fcntl.h>
```

## Remarks

The `_O_BINARY`, `_O_TEXT`, `_O_WTEXT`, `_O_U16TEXT`, and `_O_U8TEXT` manifest constants determine the translation mode for files (`_open` and `_sopen`) or the translation mode for streams (`_setmode`).

The allowed values are:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `_O_TEXT` | Opens file in ANSI text (translated) mode. Carriage return-line feed (CR-LF) combinations are translated into a single line feed (LF) on input. Line feed characters are translated into CR-LF combinations on output. Also, CTRL+Z is interpreted as an end-of-file character on input. In files opened for reading, and for reading and writing, `fopen` checks for CTRL+Z at the end of the file and removes it, if possible. It's removed because using the `fseek` and `ftell` functions to move within a file ending with CTRL+Z may cause `fseek` to behave improperly near the end of the file. |
| `_O_WTEXT` | Opens file in UTF-16 text (translated) mode. The wide-character versions of the text translations of `_O_TEXT` are supported. |
| `_O_U16TEXT` | Opens file in UTF-16 no BOM text (translated) mode. The wide-character versions of the text translations of `_O_TEXT` are supported. |
| `_O_U8TEXT` | Opens file in UTF-8 no BOM text (translated) mode. The text translations of `_O_TEXT` are supported. |
| `_O_BINARY` | Opens file in binary (untranslated) mode. The above translations are suppressed. |
| `_O_RAW` | Same as `_O_BINARY`. Supported for C 2.0 compatibility. |
