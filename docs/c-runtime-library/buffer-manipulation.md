# Buffer manipulation

Use these routines to work with areas of memory on a byte-by-byte basis.

## Buffer-manipulation routines

| Routine | Use |
|---|---|
| [`_memccpy`](reference/memccpy.md) | Copy characters from one buffer to another until given character or given number of characters has been copied |
| [`memchr`, `wmemchr`](reference/memchr-wmemchr.md) | Return pointer to first occurrence, within specified number of characters, of given character in buffer |
| [`memcmp`, `wmemcmp`](reference/memcmp-wmemcmp.md) | Compare specified number of characters from two buffers |
| [`memcpy`, `wmemcpy`](reference/memcpy-wmemcpy.md), [`memcpy_s`, `wmemcpy_s`](reference/memcpy-s-wmemcpy-s.md) | Copy specified number of characters from one buffer to another |
| [`_memicmp`, `_memicmp_l`](reference/memicmp-memicmp-l.md) | Compare specified number of characters from two buffers without regard to case |
| [`memmove`, `wmemmove`](reference/memmove-wmemmove.md), [`memmove_s`, `wmemmove_s`](reference/memmove-s-wmemmove-s.md) | Copy specified number of characters from one buffer to another |
| [`memset`, `wmemset`](reference/memset-wmemset.md) | Use given character to initialize specified number of bytes in the buffer |
| [`_swab`](reference/swab.md) | Swap bytes of data and store them at specified location |

When the source and target areas overlap, only `memmove` is guaranteed to copy the full source properly.
