# Buffer manipulation

Use these routines to work with areas of memory on a byte-by-byte basis.

## Buffer-manipulation routines

|Routine|Use|
|-------------|---------|
|[_memccpy](../c-runtime-library/reference/memccpy.md)|Copy characters from one buffer to another until given character or given number of characters has been copied|
|[memchr, wmemchr](../c-runtime-library/reference/memchr-wmemchr.md)|Return pointer to first occurrence, within specified number of characters, of given character in buffer|
|[memcmp, wmemcmp](../c-runtime-library/reference/memcmp-wmemcmp.md)|Compare specified number of characters from two buffers|
|[memcpy, wmemcpy](../c-runtime-library/reference/memcpy-wmemcpy.md), [memcpy_s, wmemcpy_s](../c-runtime-library/reference/memcpy-s-wmemcpy-s.md)|Copy specified number of characters from one buffer to another|
|[_memicmp, _memicmp_l](../c-runtime-library/reference/memicmp-memicmp-l.md)|Compare specified number of characters from two buffers without regard to case|
|[memmove, wmemmove](../c-runtime-library/reference/memmove-wmemmove.md),[memmove_s, wmemmove_s](../c-runtime-library/reference/memmove-s-wmemmove-s.md)|Copy specified number of characters from one buffer to another|
|[memset, wmemset](../c-runtime-library/reference/memset-wmemset.md)|Use given character to initialize specified number of bytes in the buffer|
|[_swab](../c-runtime-library/reference/swab.md)|Swap bytes of data and store them at specified location|

When the source and target areas overlap, only **memmove** is guaranteed to copy the full source properly.
