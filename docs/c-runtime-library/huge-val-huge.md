# HUGE_VAL, _HUGE

## Syntax

```
#include <math.h>
```

## Remarks

`HUGE_VAL` is the largest representable double value. This value is returned by many run-time math functions when an error occurs. For some functions, -`HUGE_VAL` is returned. `HUGE_VAL` is defined as `_HUGE`, but run-time math functions return `HUGE_VAL`. You should also use `HUGE_VAL` in your code for consistency.
