# Process and Environment Control

Use the process-control routines to start, stop, and manage processes from within a program. Use the environment-control routines to get and change information about the operating-system environment.

 In the Windows operating system, the spawned process is equivalent to the spawning process. Any process can use **_cwait** to wait for any other process for which the process ID is known.

 The difference between the **_exec** and **_spawn** families is that a **_spawn** function can return control from the new process to the calling process. In a **_spawn** function, both the calling process and the new process are present in memory unless **_P_OVERLAY** is specified. In an **_exec** function, the new process overlays the calling process, so control cannot return to the calling process unless an error occurs in the attempt to start execution of the new process.

 The differences among the functions in the **_exec** family, as well as among those in the **_spawn** family, involve the method of locating the file to be executed as the new process, the form in which arguments are passed to the new process, and the method of setting the environment, as shown in the following table. Use a function that passes an argument list when the number of arguments is constant or is known at compile time. Use a function that passes a pointer to an array containing the arguments when the number of arguments is to be determined at run time. The information in the following table also applies to the wide-character counterparts of the **_spawn** and **_exec** functions.
