# Time management

Use these functions to get the current time and convert, adjust, and store it as necessary. The current time is the system time.

The **`_ftime`** and **`localtime`** routines use the **`TZ`** environment variable. If **`TZ`** isn't set, the run-time library attempts to use the time-zone information specified by the operating system. If this information is unavailable, these functions use the default value of PST8PDT. For more information on **`TZ`**, see [`_tzset`](reference/tzset.md); also see [`_daylight`, `timezone`, and `_tzname`](daylight-dstbias-timezone-and-tzname.md).

### Time routines

| Function | Use |
|---|---|
| [`asctime`, `_wasctime`](reference/asctime-wasctime.md), [`asctime_s`, `_wasctime_s`](reference/asctime-s-wasctime-s.md) | Convert time from type **`struct tm`** to character string. The versions of these functions with the **`_s`** suffix are more secure. |
| [`clock`](reference/clock.md) | Return elapsed wall-clock time for process. |
| [`ctime`, `_ctime32`, `_ctime64`, `_wctime`, `_wctime32`, `_wctime64`](reference/ctime-ctime32-ctime64-wctime-wctime32-wctime64.md), [`_ctime_s`, `_ctime32_s`, `_ctime64_s`, `_wctime_s`, `_wctime32_s`, `_wctime64_s`](reference/ctime-s-ctime32-s-ctime64-s-wctime-s-wctime32-s-wctime64-s.md) | Convert time from type **`time_t`**, **`__time32_t`** or **`__time64_t`** to character string. The versions of these functions with the **`_s`** suffix are more secure. |
| [`difftime`, `_difftime32`, `_difftime64`](reference/difftime-difftime32-difftime64.md) | Compute difference between two times. |
| [`_ftime`, `_ftime32`, `_ftime64`](reference/ftime-ftime32-ftime64.md), [`_ftime_s`, `_ftime32_s`, _ftime64_s](reference/ftime-s-ftime32-s-ftime64-s.md) | Store current system time in variable of type **`struct _timeb`** or type **`struct __timeb64`** The versions of these functions with the **`_s`** suffix are more secure. |
| [`_futime`, `_futime32`, `_futime64`](reference/futime-futime32-futime64.md) | Set modification time on open file |
| [`gmtime`, `_gmtime32`, `_gmtime64`](reference/gmtime-gmtime32-gmtime64.md), [`gmtime_s`, `_gmtime32_s`, `_gmtime64_s`](reference/gmtime-s-gmtime32-s-gmtime64-s.md) | Convert time from type **`time_t`** to **`struct tm`** or from type **`__time64_t`** to **`struct tm`**. The versions of these functions with the **`_s`** suffix are more secure. |
| [`localtime`, `_localtime32`, `_localtime64`](reference/localtime-localtime32-localtime64.md), [`localtime_s`, `_localtime32_s`, `_localtime64_s`](reference/localtime-s-localtime32-s-localtime64-s.md) | Convert time from type **`time_t`** to **`struct tm`** or from type **`__time64_t`** to **`struct tm`** with local correction. The versions of these functions with the **`_s`** suffix are more secure. |
| [`_mkgmtime`, `_mkgmtime32`, `_mkgmtime64`](reference/mkgmtime-mkgmtime32-mkgmtime64.md) | Convert time to calendar value in Greenwich Mean Time. |
| [`mktime`, `_mktime32`, `_mktime64`](reference/mktime-mktime32-mktime64.md) | Convert time to calendar value. |
| [`_strdate`, `_wstrdate`](reference/strdate-wstrdate.md), [`_strdate_s`, `_wstrdate_s`](reference/strdate-s-wstrdate-s.md) | Return current system date as string. The versions of these functions with the **`_s`** suffix are more secure. |
| [`strftime`, `wcsftime`, `_strftime_l`, `_wcsftime_l`](reference/strftime-wcsftime-strftime-l-wcsftime-l.md) | Format date-and-time string for international use. |
| [`_strtime`, `_wstrtime`](reference/strtime-wstrtime.md), [`_strtime_s`, `_wstrtime_s`](reference/strtime-s-wstrtime-s.md) | Return current system time as string. The versions of these functions with the **`_s`** suffix are more secure. |
| [`time`, `_time32`, `_time64`](reference/time-time32-time64.md) | Get current system time as type **`time_t`**, **`__time32_t`** or as type **`__time64_t`**. |
| [`_tzset`](reference/tzset.md) | Set external time variables from environment time variable **`TZ`**. |
| [`_utime`, `_utime32`, `_utime64`, `_wutime`, `_wutime32`, `_wutime64`](reference/utime-utime32-utime64-wutime-wutime32-wutime64.md) | Set modification time for specified file using either current time or time value stored in structure. |

> [!NOTE]
> In all versions of Microsoft C/C++ except Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0, and in all versions of Visual C++, the time function returns the current time as the number of seconds elapsed since midnight on January 1, 1970. In Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0, **`time`** returned the current time as the number of seconds elapsed since midnight on December 31, 1899.

> [!NOTE]
> In versions of Visual C++ and Microsoft C/C++ before Visual Studio 2005, **`time_t`** was a **`long int`** (32 bits) and hence could not be used for dates past 3:14:07 January 19, 2038, UTC. **`time_t`** is now equivalent to **`__time64_t`** by default, but defining `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T` changes **`time_t`** to **`__time32_t`** and forces many time functions to call versions that take the 32-bit **`time_t`**. For more information, see [Standard types](standard-types.md) and comments in the documentation for the individual time functions.
