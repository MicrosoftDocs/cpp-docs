# _CRT_DISABLE_PERFCRIT_LOCKS
Disables performance-critical locking in I/O operations.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#define _CRT_DISABLE_PERFCRIT_LOCKS  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Defining this symbol can improve performance in single-threaded I/O-bound programs by forcing all I/O operations to assume a single-threaded I/O model. For more information, see [Multithreaded Libraries Performance](../c-runtime-library/multithreaded-libraries-performance.md).
