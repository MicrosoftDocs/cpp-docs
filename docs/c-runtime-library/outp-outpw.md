These POSIX functions are deprecated. Use the ISO C++ conformant [_outp, _outpw, _outpd](../c-runtime-library/outp-outpw-outpd.md) instead.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  These functions are obsolete. Beginning in Visual Studio 2015, they are not available in the CRT.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This API cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime. For more information, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).
