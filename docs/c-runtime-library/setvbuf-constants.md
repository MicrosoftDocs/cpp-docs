# setvbuf Constants

## Syntax

```
#include <stdio.h>
```

## Remarks

These constants represent the type of buffer for `setvbuf`.

The possible values are given by the following manifest constants:

|Constant|Meaning|
|--------------|-------------|
|`_IOFBF`|Full buffering: Buffer specified in call to `setvbuf` is used and its size is as specified in `setvbuf` call. If buffer pointer is **NULL**, automatically allocated buffer of specified size is used.|
|`_IOLBF`|Same as `_IOFBF`.|
|`_IONBF`|No buffer is used, regardless of arguments in call to `setvbuf`.|
