# _lock
Acquires a multi-thread lock.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This function is obsolete. Beginning in Visual Studio 2015, it is not available in the CRT.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
void __cdecl _lock  
   int locknum  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 [in] `locknum`  
 The identifier of the lock to acquire.  
  
## Remarks  
 If the lock has already been acquired, this method acquires the lock anyway and causes an internal C run-time (CRT) error. If the method cannot acquire a lock, it exits with a fatal error and sets the error code to `_RT_LOCK`.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Source:** mlock.c
