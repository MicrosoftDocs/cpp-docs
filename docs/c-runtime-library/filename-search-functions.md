# Filename Search Functions
These functions search for and close searches for specified file names:  
  
-   [_findnext, _wfindnext](../c-runtime-library/reference/findnext-functions.md)  
  
-   [_findfirst, _wfindfirst](../c-runtime-library/reference/findfirst-functions.md)  
  
-   [_findclose](../c-runtime-library/reference/findclose.md)  
  
## Remarks  
 The `_findfirst` function provides information about the first instance of a file name that matches the file specified in the `filespec` argument. You can use in `filespec` any combination of wildcard characters that is supported by the host operating system.  
  
 The functions return file information in a `_finddata_t` structure, which is defined in IO.h. Various functions in the family use many variations on the `_finddata_t` structure. The basic `_finddata_t` structure includes the following elements:  
  
 `unsigned attrib`  
 File attribute.  
  
 `time_t time_create`  
 Time of file creation (-1L for FAT file systems). This time is stored in UTC format. To convert to the local time, use [localtime_s](../c-runtime-library/reference/localtime-s-localtime32-s-localtime64-s.md).  
  
 `time_t time_access`  
 Time of the last file access (-1L for FAT file systems). This time is stored in UTC format. To convert to the local time, use `localtime_s`.  
  
 `time_t time_write`  
 Time of the last write to file. This time is stored in UTC format. To convert to the local time, use `localtime_s`.  
  
 `_fsize_t size`  
 Length of the file in bytes.  
  
 `char name`[ `_MAX_PATH`]  
 Null-terminated name of matched file or directory, without the path.  
  
 In file systems that do not support the creation and last access times of a file, such as the FAT system, the `time_create` and `time_access` fields are always -1L.  
  
 `_MAX_PATH` is defined in Stdlib.h as 260 bytes.  
  
 You cannot specify target attributes (such as `_A_RDONLY`) to limit the find operation. These attributes are returned in the `attrib` field of the `_finddata_t` structure and can have the following values (defined in IO.h). Users should not rely on these being the only values possible for the `attrib` field.  
  
 `_A_ARCH`  
 Archive. Set whenever the file is changed and cleared by the **BACKUP** command. Value: 0x20.  
  
 `_A_HIDDEN`  
 Hidden file. Not generally seen with the DIR command, unless you use the **/AH** option. Returns information about normal files and files that have this attribute. Value: 0x02.  
  
 `_A_NORMAL`  
 Normal. File has no other attributes set and can be read or written to without restriction. Value: 0x00.  
  
 `_A_RDONLY`  
 Read-only. File cannot be opened for writing and a file that has the same name cannot be created. Value: 0x01.  
  
 `_A_SUBDIR`  
 Subdirectory. Value: 0x10.  
  
 `_A_SYSTEM`  
 System file. Not ordinarily seen with the **DIR** command, unless the **/A** or **/A:S** option is used. Value: 0x04.  
  
 `_findnext` finds the next name, if any, that matches the `filespec` argument specified in an earlier call to `_findfirst`. The `fileinfo` argument should point to a structure initialized by the previous call to `_findfirst`. If a match is found, the `fileinfo` structure contents are changed as described earlier. Otherwise, it is left unchanged. `_findclose` closes the specified search handle and releases all associated resources for both `_findfirst` and `_findnext`. The handle returned by either `_findfirst` or `_findnext` must first be passed to `_findclose`, before modification operations, such as deleting, can be performed on the directories that form the paths passed to them.  
  
 You can nest the `_find` functions. For example, if a call to `_findfirst` or `_findnext` finds the file that is a subdirectory, a new search can be initiated with another call to `_findfirst` or `_findnext`.  
  
 `_wfindfirst` and `_wfindnext` are wide-character versions of `_findfirst` and `_findnext`. The structure argument of the wide-character versions has the `_wfinddata_t` data type, which is defined in IO.h and in Wchar.h. The fields of this data type are the same as those of the `_finddata_t` data type, except that in `_wfinddata_t` the name field is of type `wchar_t` instead of type `char`. Otherwise `_wfindfirst` and `_wfindnext` behave identically to `_findfirst` and `_findnext`.  
  
 `_findfirst` and `_findnext` use the 64-bit time type. If you must use the old 32-bit time type, you can define `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T`. The versions of these functions that have the `32` suffix in their names use the 32-bit time type, and those with the `64` suffix use the 64-bit time type.  
  
 Functions `_findfirst32i64`, `_findnext32i64`, `_wfindfirst32i64`, and `_wfindnext32i64` also behave identically to the 32-bit time type versions of these functions except they use and return 64-bit file lengths. Functions `_findfirst64i32`, `_findnext64i32`, `_wfindfirst64i32`, and `_wfindnext64i32` use the 64-bit time type but use 32-bit file lengths. These functions use appropriate variations of the `_finddata_t` type in which the fields have different types for the time and the file size.  
  
 `_finddata_t` is actually a macro that evaluates to `_finddata64i32_t` (or `_finddata32_t` if `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T` is defined). The following table summarizes the variations on `_finddata_t`:  
  
|Structure|Time type|File size type|  
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|  
|`_finddata_t`, `_wfinddata_t`|`__time64_t`|`_fsize_t`|  
|`_finddata32_t`, `_wfinddata32_t`|`__time32_t`|`_fsize_t`|  
|`__finddata64_t`, `__wfinddata64_t`|`__time64_t`|`__int64`|  
|`_finddata32i64_t`, `_wfinddata32i64_t`|`__time32_t`|`__int64`|  
|`_finddata64i32_t`, `_wfinddata64i32_t`|`__time64_t`|`_fsize_t`|  
  
 `_fsize_t` is a `typedef` for `unsigned long` (32 bits).  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// crt_find.c  
// This program uses the 32-bit _find functions to print  
// a list of all files (and their attributes) with a .C extension  
// in the current directory.  
  
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <stdlib.h>  
#include <io.h>  
#include <time.h>  
  
int main( void )  
{  
   struct _finddata_t c_file;  
   intptr_t hFile;  
  
   // Find first .c file in current directory   
   if( (hFile = _findfirst( "*.c", &c_file )) == -1L )  
      printf( "No *.c files in current directory!\n" );  
   else  
   {  
      printf( "Listing of .c files\n\n" );  
      printf( "RDO HID SYS ARC  FILE         DATE %25c SIZE\n", ' ' );  
      printf( "--- --- --- ---  ----         ---- %25c ----\n", ' ' );  
      do {  
         char buffer[30];  
         printf( ( c_file.attrib & _A_RDONLY ) ? " Y  " : " N  " );  
         printf( ( c_file.attrib & _A_HIDDEN ) ? " Y  " : " N  " );  
         printf( ( c_file.attrib & _A_SYSTEM ) ? " Y  " : " N  " );  
         printf( ( c_file.attrib & _A_ARCH )   ? " Y  " : " N  " );  
         ctime_s( buffer, _countof(buffer), &c_file.time_write );  
         printf( " %-12s %.24s  %9ld\n",  
            c_file.name, buffer, c_file.size );  
      } while( _findnext( hFile, &c_file ) == 0 );  
      _findclose( hFile );  
   }  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
Listing of .c files
