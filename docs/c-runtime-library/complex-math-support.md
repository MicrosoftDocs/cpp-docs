# C complex math support

The Microsoft C Runtime library (CRT) provides complex math library functions, including all of those required by ISO C99. The compiler does not directly support a **complex** or **_Complex** keyword, therefore the Microsoft implementation uses structure types to represent complex numbers.

These functions are implemented to balance performance with correctness. Because producing the correctly rounded result may be prohibitively expensive, these functions are designed to efficiently produce a close approximation to the correctly rounded result. In most cases, the result produced is within +/-1 ulp of the correctly rounded result, though there may be cases where there is greater inaccuracy.

The complex math routines rely on the floating point math library functions for their implementation. These functions have different implementations for different CPU architectures. For example, the 32-bit x86 CRT may have a different implementation than the 64-bit x64 CRT. In addition, some of the functions may have multiple implementations for a given CPU architecture. The most efficient implementation is selected dynamically at run-time depending on the instruction sets supported by the CPU. For example, in the 32-bit x86 CRT, some functions have both an x87 implementation and an SSE2 implementation. When running on a CPU that supports SSE2, the faster SSE2 implementation is used. When running on a CPU that does not support SSE2, the slower x87 implementation is used. Because different implementations of the math library functions may use different CPU instructions and different algorithms to produce their results, the functions may produce different results across CPUs. In most cases, the results are within +/-1 ulp of the correctly rounded result, but the actual results may vary across CPUs.

## Types used in complex math

The Microsoft implementation of the complex.h header defines these types as equivalents for the C99 standard native complex types:

|Standard type|Microsoft type|
|-|-|
|**float complex** or **float _Complex**|**_FComplex**|
|**double complex** or **double _Complex**|**_DComplex**|
|**long double complex** or **long double _Complex**|**_LComplex**|

The math.h header defines a separate type, **struct _complex**, used for the [_cabs](../c-runtime-library/reference/cabs.md) function. The **struct _complex** type is not used by the equivalent complex math functions [cabs, cabsf, cabsl](../c-runtime-library/reference/cabs-cabsf-cabsl.md).

## Complex constants and macros

**I** is defined as the **float** complex type **_FComplex** initialized by `{ 0.0f, 1.0f }`.
