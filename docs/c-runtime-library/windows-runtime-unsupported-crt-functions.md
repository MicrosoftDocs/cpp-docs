# Windows Runtime Unsupported CRT Functions

Many C run-time (CRT) APIs canâ€™t be used in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that execute in the Windows Runtime. These apps are built by using the /ZW compiler flag. For a list of unsupported CRT functions, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](../cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps.md).

All CRT APIs are described in the [Alphabetical Function Reference](../c-runtime-library/reference/crt-alphabetical-function-reference.md) section of the documentation.
