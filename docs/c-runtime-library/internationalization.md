# Internationalization

The Microsoft runtime library provides many routines that you can use to customize your app for international markets such as:

- [locale-related routines](./locale.md)
- wide-character routines
- multibyte-character routines
- generic-text routines

For convenience, most locale-related routines are also categorized by what they do.

Multibyte routines and wide-character routines are described alongside their single-byte-character counterparts, when they exist.

ISO646 operator alternatives are also included.
