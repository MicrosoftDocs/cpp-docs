# _locking Constants
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
#include <sys/locking.h>  
  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The *mode* argument in the call to the `_locking` function specifies the locking action to be performed.  
  
 The *mode* argument must be one of the following manifest constants.  
  
 `_LK_LOCK`  
 Locks the specified bytes. If the bytes cannot be locked, the function tries again after 1 second. If, after 10 attempts, the bytes cannot be locked, the function returns an error.  
  
 `_LK_RLCK`  
 Same as `_LK_LOCK`.  
  
 `_LK_NBLCK`  
 Locks the specified bytes. If bytes cannot be locked, the function returns an error.  
  
 `_LK_NBRLCK`  
 Same as `_LK_NBLCK`.  
  
 `_LK_UNLCK`  
 Unlocks the specified bytes. (The bytes must have been previously locked.)
