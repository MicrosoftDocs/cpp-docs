# File Attribute Constants
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
#include <io.h>  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 These constants specify the current attributes of the file or directory specified by the function.  
  
 The attributes are represented by the following manifest constants:  
  
 `_A_ARCH`  
 Archive. Set whenever the file is changed, and cleared by the BACKUP command. Value: 0x20  
  
 `_A_HIDDEN`  
 Hidden file. Not normally seen with the DIR command, unless the /AH option is used. Returns information about normal files as well as files with this attribute. Value: 0x02  
  
 `_A_NORMAL`  
 Normal. File can be read or written to without restriction. Value: 0x00  
  
 `_A_RDONLY`  
 Read-only. File cannot be opened for writing, and a file with the same name cannot be created. Value: 0x01  
  
 `_A_SUBDIR`  
 Subdirectory. Value: 0x10  
  
 `_A_SYSTEM`  
 System file. Not normally seen with the DIR command, unless the /AS option is used. Value: 0x04  
  
 Multiple constants can be combined with the OR operator (&#124;).
