# spawn Constants
## Syntax  
  
```  
#include <process.h>  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The `mode` argument determines the action taken by the calling process before and during a spawn operation. The following values for `mode` are possible:  
  
|Constant|Meaning|  
|--------------|-------------|  
|`_P_OVERLAY`|Overlays calling process with new process, destroying calling process (same effect as `_exec` calls).|  
|`_P_WAIT`|Suspends calling thread until execution of new process is complete (synchronous `_spawn`).|  
|`_P_NOWAIT`, `_P_NOWAITO`|Continues to execute calling process concurrently with new process (asynchronous `_spawn`).|  
|`_P_DETACH`|Continues to execute calling process; new process is run in background with no access to console or keyboard. Calls to `_cwait` against new process will fail. This is an asynchronous `_spawn`.|
