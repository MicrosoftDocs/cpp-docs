## Remarks

These routines test characters for specified conditions.

The **is** routines produce meaningful results for any integer argument from -1 (`EOF`) to **UCHAR_MAX** (0xFF), inclusive. The expected argument type is `int`.

> [!CAUTION]
> For the **is** routines, passing an argument of type `char` may yield unpredictable results. An SBCS or MBCS single-byte character of type `char` with a value greater than 0x7F is negative. If a `char` is passed, the compiler may convert the value to a signed `int` or a signed **long**. This value may be sign-extended by the compiler, with unexpected results.

The **isw** routines produce meaningful results for any integer value from - 1 (**WEOF**) to 0xFFFF, inclusive. The **wint_t** data type is defined in WCHAR.H as an **unsigned short**; it can hold any wide character or the wide-character end-of-file (**WEOF**) value.

The output value is affected by the setting of the `LC_CTYPE` category setting of the locale; see [setlocale](../c-runtime-library/reference/setlocale-wsetlocale.md) for more information. The versions of these functions without the **_l** suffix use the current locale for this locale-dependent behavior; the versions with the **_l** suffix are identical except that they use the locale parameter passed in instead.

In the "C" locale, the test conditions for the **is** routines are as follows:

`isalnum`  
Alphanumeric (A - Z, a - z, or 0 - 9).

`isalpha`  
Alphabetic (A - Z or a - z).

`__isascii`  
ASCII character (0x00 - 0x7F).

`isblank`  
Horizontal tab or space character (0x09 or 0x20).

`iscntrl`  
Control character (0x00 - 0x1F or 0x7F).

`__iscsym`  
Letter, underscore, or digit.

`__iscsymf`  
Letter or underscore.

`isdigit`  
Decimal digit (0 - 9).

`isgraph`  
Printable character except space ( ).

`islower`  
Lowercase letter (a - z).

`isprint`  
Printable character including space (0x20 - 0x7E).

`ispunct`  
Punctuation character.

`isspace`  
White-space character (0x09 - 0x0D or 0x20).

`isupper`  
Uppercase letter (A - Z).

`isxdigit`  
Hexadecimal digit (A - F, a - f, or 0 - 9).

For the **isw** routines, the result of the test for the specified condition is independent of locale. The test conditions for the **isw** functions are as follows:

`iswalnum`  
`iswalpha` or `iswdigit`.

`iswalpha`  
Any wide character that is one of an implementation-defined set for which none of `iswcntrl`, `iswdigit`, `iswpunct`, or `iswspace` is nonzero. `iswalpha` returns nonzero only for wide characters for which `iswupper` or `iswlower` is nonzero.

`iswascii`  
Wide-character representation of ASCII character (0x0000 - 0x007F).

`iswblank`  
Wide character that corresponds to the standard space character or is one of an implementation-defined set of wide characters for which `iswalnum` is false. Standard blank characters are space (L' ') and horizontal tab (L'\t').

`iswcntrl`  
Control wide character.

`__iswcsym`  
Any wide character for which `isalnum` is true, or the '_' character.

`__iswcsymf`  
Any wide character for which `iswalpha` is true, or the '_' character.

`iswctype`  
Character has property specified by the `desc` argument. For each valid value of the `desc` argument of `iswctype`, there is an equivalent wide-character classification routine, as shown in the following table:

### Equivalence of iswctype(c, desc) to Other isw Testing Routines

|Value of *desc* argument|iswctype( *c, desc* ) equivalent|
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|**_ALPHA**|**iswalpha(** `c` **)**|
|**_ALPHA** &#124; **_DIGIT**|**iswalnum(** `c` **)**|
|**_BLANK**|**iswblank(** `c` **)**|
|**_CONTROL**|**iswcntrl(** `c` **)**|
|**_DIGIT**|**iswdigit(** `c` **)**|
|**_ALPHA** &#124; **_DIGIT** &#124; **_PUNCT**|**iswgraph(** `c` **)**|
|**_LOWER**|**iswlower(** `c` **)**|
|**_ALPHA** &#124; **_BLANK** &#124; **_DIGIT** &#124; **_PUNCT**|**iswprint(** `c` **)**|
|**_PUNCT**|**iswpunct(** `c` **)**|
|**_BLANK**|**iswblank(** `c` **)**|
|**_SPACE**|**iswspace(** `c` **)**|
|**_UPPER**|**iswupper(** `c` **)**|
|**_HEX**|**iswxdigit(** `c` **)**|

`iswdigit`  
Wide character corresponding to a decimal-digit character.

`iswgraph`  
Printable wide character except space wide character (L' ').

`iswlower`  
Lowercase letter, or one of implementation-defined set of wide characters for which none of `iswcntrl`, `iswdigit`, `iswpunct`, or `iswspace` is nonzero. `iswlower` returns nonzero only for wide characters that correspond to lowercase letters.

`iswprint`  
Printable wide character, including space wide character (L' ').

`iswpunct`  
Printable wide character that is neither space wide character (L' ') nor wide character for which `iswalnum` is nonzero.

`iswspace`  
Wide character that corresponds to standard white-space character or is one of implementation-defined set of wide characters for which `iswalnum` is false. Standard white-space characters are: space (L' '), formfeed (L'\f'), newline (L'\n'), carriage return (L'\r'), horizontal tab (L'\t'), and vertical tab (L'\v').

`iswupper`  
Wide character that is uppercase or is one of an implementation-defined set of wide characters for which none of `iswcntrl`, `iswdigit`, `iswpunct`, or `iswspace` is nonzero. `iswupper` returns nonzero only for wide characters that correspond to uppercase characters.

`iswxdigit`  
Wide character that corresponds to a hexadecimal-digit character.

## Example

```C
// crt_isfam.c
/* This program tests all characters between 0x0
* and 0x7F, then displays each character with abbreviations
* for the character-type codes that apply.
*/  

#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main( void )  
{  
   int ch;
   for( ch = 0; ch <= 0x7F; ch++ )  
   {  
      printf( "%.2x  ", ch );
      printf( " %c", isprint( ch )  ? ch   : ' ' );
      printf( "%4s", isalnum( ch )  ? "AN" : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isalpha( ch )  ? "A"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", __isascii( ch )  ? "AS" : "" );
      printf( "%3s", iscntrl( ch )  ? "C"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", __iscsym( ch )  ? "CS "  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", __iscsymf( ch )  ? "CSF"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isdigit( ch )  ? "D"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isgraph( ch )  ? "G"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", islower( ch )  ? "L"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", ispunct( ch )  ? "PU" : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isspace( ch )  ? "S"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isprint( ch )  ? "PR" : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isupper( ch )  ? "U"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isxdigit( ch ) ? "X"  : "" );
      printf( ".\n" );
   }  
}  
```
