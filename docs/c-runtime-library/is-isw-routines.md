## Remarks

These routines test characters for specified conditions.

The `is` routines produce meaningful results for any integer argument from -1 (`EOF`) to `UCHAR_MAX` (0xFF), inclusive. The expected argument type is **`int`**.

> [!CAUTION]
> For the `is` routines, passing an argument of type **`char`** may yield unpredictable results. An SBCS or MBCS single-byte character of type **`char`** with a value greater than 0x7F is negative. If a **`char`** is passed, the compiler may convert the value to a **`signed int`** or a **`signed long`**. This value may be sign-extended by the compiler, with unexpected results.

The `isw` routines produce meaningful results for any integer value from -1 (`WEOF`) to 0xFFFF, inclusive. The `wint_t` data type is defined in `<WCHAR.H>` as an **`unsigned short`**. It can hold any wide character or the wide-character end-of-file (`WEOF`) value.

The output value is affected by the setting of the `LC_CTYPE` category setting of the locale. For more information, see [`setlocale`](./reference/setlocale-wsetlocale.md). The versions of these functions without the **`_l`** suffix use the current locale for this locale-dependent behavior; the versions with the **`_l`** suffix are identical except that they use the locale parameter passed in instead.

In the "C" locale, the test conditions for the `is` routines are as follows:

`isalnum`\
Alphanumeric (A - Z, a - z, or 0 - 9).

`isalpha`\
Alphabetic (A - Z or a - z).

`__isascii`\
ASCII character (0x00 - 0x7F).

`isblank`\
Horizontal tab or space character (0x09 or 0x20).

`iscntrl`\
Control character (0x00 - 0x1F or 0x7F).

`__iscsym`\
Letter, underscore, or digit.

`__iscsymf`\
Letter or underscore.

`isdigit`\
Decimal digit (0 - 9).

`isgraph`\
Printable character except space (0x20).

`islower`\
Lowercase letter (a - z).

`isprint`\
Printable character including space (0x20 - 0x7E).

`ispunct`\
Punctuation character.

`isspace`\
White-space character (0x09 - 0x0D or 0x20).

`isupper`\
Uppercase letter (A - Z).

`isxdigit`\
Hexadecimal digit (A - F, a - f, or 0 - 9).

For the `isw` routines, the result of the test for the specified condition is independent of locale. The test conditions for the `isw` functions are as follows:

`iswalnum`\
`iswalpha` or `iswdigit`.

`iswalpha`\
Any wide character that is one of an implementation-defined set for which none of `iswcntrl`, `iswdigit`, `iswpunct`, or `iswspace` is nonzero. `iswalpha` returns nonzero only for wide characters for which `iswupper` or `iswlower` is nonzero.

`iswascii`\
Wide-character representation of ASCII character (0x0000 - 0x007F).

`iswblank`\
Wide character that corresponds to the standard space character or is one of an implementation-defined set of wide characters for which `iswalnum` is false. Standard blank characters are space (`L' '`) and horizontal tab (`L'\t'`).

`iswcntrl`\
Control wide character.

`__iswcsym`\
Any wide character for which `isalnum` is true, or the '_' character.

`__iswcsymf`\
Any wide character for which `iswalpha` is true, or the '_' character.

`iswctype`\
Character has property specified by the `desc` argument. For each valid value of the `desc` argument of `iswctype`, there's an equivalent wide-character classification routine, as shown in the following table:

### Equivalence of `iswctype(c, desc)` to other `isw` testing routines

| Value of *`desc`* argument | `iswctype(c, desc)` equivalent |
|--|--|
| `_ALPHA` | `iswalpha(c)` |
| `_ALPHA | _DIGIT` | `iswalnum(c)` |
| `_BLANK` | `iswblank(c)` |
| `_CONTROL` | `iswcntrl(c)` |
| `_DIGIT` | `iswdigit(c)` |
| `_ALPHA | _DIGIT | _PUNCT` | `iswgraph(c)` |
| `_LOWER` | `iswlower(c)` |
| `_ALPHA | _BLANK | _DIGIT | _PUNCT` | `iswprint(c)` |
| `_PUNCT` | `iswpunct(c)` |
| `_SPACE` | `iswspace(c)` |
| `_UPPER` | `iswupper(c)` |
| `_HEX` | `iswxdigit(c)` |

`iswdigit`\
Wide character corresponding to a decimal-digit character.

`iswgraph`\
Printable wide character except space wide character (`L' '`).

`iswlower`\
Lowercase letter, or one of implementation-defined set of wide characters for which none of `iswcntrl`, `iswdigit`, `iswpunct`, or `iswspace` is nonzero. `iswlower` returns nonzero only for wide characters that correspond to lowercase letters.

`iswprint`\
Printable wide character, including space wide character (`L' '`).

`iswpunct`\
Printable wide character that's both not a space wide character (`L' '`) and not a wide character for which `iswalnum` is nonzero.

`iswspace`\
Wide character that corresponds to standard white-space character or is one of implementation-defined set of wide characters for which `iswalnum` is false. Standard white-space characters are: space (`L' '`), form feed (`L'\f'`), newline (`L'\n'`), carriage return (`L'\r'`), horizontal tab (`L'\t'`), and vertical tab (`L'\v'`).

`iswupper`\
Wide character that is uppercase or is one of an implementation-defined set of wide characters for which none of `iswcntrl`, `iswdigit`, `iswpunct`, or `iswspace` is nonzero. `iswupper` returns nonzero only for wide characters that correspond to uppercase characters.

`iswxdigit`\
Wide character that corresponds to a hexadecimal-digit character.

## Example

```C
// crt_isfam.c
/* This program tests all characters between 0x0
* and 0x7F, then displays each character with abbreviations
* for the character-type codes that apply.
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main( void )
{
   int ch;
   for( ch = 0; ch <= 0x7F; ch++ )
   {
      printf( "%.2x  ", ch );
      printf( " %c", isprint( ch )  ? ch   : ' ' );
      printf( "%4s", isalnum( ch )  ? "AN" : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isalpha( ch )  ? "A"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", __isascii( ch )  ? "AS" : "" );
      printf( "%3s", iscntrl( ch )  ? "C"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", __iscsym( ch )  ? "CS "  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", __iscsymf( ch )  ? "CSF"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isdigit( ch )  ? "D"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isgraph( ch )  ? "G"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", islower( ch )  ? "L"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", ispunct( ch )  ? "PU" : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isspace( ch )  ? "S"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isprint( ch )  ? "PR" : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isupper( ch )  ? "U"  : "" );
      printf( "%3s", isxdigit( ch ) ? "X"  : "" );
      printf( ".\n" );
   }
}
```
