# Sharing Constants

Constants for file-sharing modes.

## Syntax

```
#include <share.h>
```

## Remarks

The *shflag* argument determines the sharing mode, which consists of one or more manifest constants. These can be combined with the *oflag* arguments (see [File Constants](../c-runtime-library/file-constants.md)).

The following table lists the constants and their meanings:

|Constant|Meaning|
|--------------|-------------|
|`_SH_DENYRW`|Denies read and write access to file|
|`_SH_DENYWR`|Denies write access to file|
|`_SH_DENYRD`|Denies read access to file|
|`_SH_DENYNO`|Permits read and write access|
|`_SH_SECURE`|Sets secure mode (shared read, exclusive write access).|
