# _acmdln, _tcmdln, _wcmdln
Internal CRT global variable. The command line.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
char * _acmdln;  
wchar_t * _wcmdln;  
  
#ifdef WPRFLAG  
   #define _tcmdln _wcmdln  
#else  
   #define _tcmdln _acmdln  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 These CRT internal variables store the complete command line. They are exposed in the exported symbols for the CRT, but are not intended for use in your code. `_acmdln` stores the data as a character string. `_wcmdln` stores the data as a wide character string. `_tcmdln` can be defined as either `_acmdln` or `_wcmdln`, depending on which is appropriate.
