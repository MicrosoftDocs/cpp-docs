# Using generic-text mappings

**Microsoft Specific**

To simplify code development for various international markets, the Microsoft run-time library provides Microsoft-specific "generic-text" mappings for many data types, routines, and other objects. These mappings are defined in `TCHAR.H`. You can use these name mappings to write generic code that can be compiled for any of the three kinds of character sets: ASCII (SBCS), MBCS, or Unicode, depending on a manifest constant you define using a `#define` statement. Generic-text mappings are Microsoft extensions that aren't ANSI compatible.

### Preprocessor directives for generic-text mappings

| `#define` | Compiled version | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `_UNICODE` | Unicode (wide-character) | `_tcsrev` maps to `_wcsrev` |
| `_MBCS` | Multibyte-character | `_tcsrev` maps to `_mbsrev` |
| None (the default: both `_UNICODE` and `_MBCS` not defined) | SBCS (ASCII) | `_tcsrev` maps to `strrev` |

For example, the generic-text function `_tcsrev`, defined in `TCHAR.H`, maps to `_mbsrev` if `_MBCS` has been defined in your program, or to `_wcsrev` if `_UNICODE` has been defined. Otherwise `_tcsrev` maps to `strrev`.

The generic-text data type `_TCHAR`, also defined in `TCHAR.H`, maps to type **`char`** if `_MBCS` is defined, to type **`wchar_t`** if `_UNICODE` is defined, and to type **`char`** if neither constant is defined. Other data type mappings are provided in `TCHAR.H` for programming convenience, but `_TCHAR` is the type that is most useful.

### Generic-Text Data Type Mappings

| Generic-text data type name | SBCS (`_UNICODE`, `_MBCS` not defined) | `_MBCS` defined | `_UNICODE` defined |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_TCHAR` | **`char`** | **`char`** | **`wchar_t`** |
| `_TINT` | **`int`** | **`int`** | `wint_t` |
| `_TSCHAR` | **`signed char`** | **`signed char`** | **`wchar_t`** |
| `_TUCHAR` | **`unsigned char`** | **`unsigned char`** | **`wchar_t`** |
| `_TXCHAR` | **`char`** | **`unsigned char`** | **`wchar_t`** |
| `_T` or `_TEXT` | No effect (removed by preprocessor) | No effect (removed by preprocessor) | `L` (converts following character or string to its Unicode counterpart) |

For a complete list of generic-text mappings of routines, variables, and other objects, see [Generic-text mappings](generic-text-mappings.md).

The following code fragments illustrate the use of `_TCHAR` and `_tcsrev` for mapping to the MBCS, Unicode, and SBCS models.

```C
_TCHAR *RetVal, *szString;
RetVal = _tcsrev(szString);
```

If `_MBCS` has been defined, the preprocessor maps the preceding fragment to the following code:

```C
char *RetVal, *szString;
RetVal = _mbsrev(szString);
```

If `_UNICODE` has been defined, the preprocessor maps the same fragment to the following code:

```C
wchar_t *RetVal, *szString;
RetVal = _wcsrev(szString);
```

If both `_MBCS` and `_UNICODE` haven't been defined, the preprocessor maps the fragment to single-byte ASCII code, as follows:

```C
char *RetVal, *szString;
RetVal = strrev(szString);
```

These macros let you write, maintain, and compile a single source code file using routines specific to all three kinds of character sets.
