# Selection Statements (C++)

The C++ selection statements, [if](../cpp/if-else-statement-cpp.md) and [switch](../cpp/switch-statement-cpp.md), provide a means to conditionally execute sections of code.

The [__if_exists](../cpp/if-exists-statement.md) and [__if_not_exists](../cpp/if-not-exists-statement.md) statements allow you to conditionally include code depending on the existence of a symbol.

See the individual topics for the syntax for each statement.
