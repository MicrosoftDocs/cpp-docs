# Numerical Limits (C++)

The two standard include files, \<limits.h> and \<float.h>, define the numerical limits, or minimum and maximum values that a variable of a given type can hold. These minimums and maximums are guaranteed to be portable to any C++ compiler that uses the same data representation as ANSI C. The \<limits.h> include file defines the [numerical limits for integral types](../cpp/integer-limits.md), and \<float.h> defines the [numerical limits for floating types](../cpp/floating-limits.md).
