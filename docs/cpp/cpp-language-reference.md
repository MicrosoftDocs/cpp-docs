# C++ Language Reference

This reference explains the C++ programming language as implemented in the Microsoft C++ compiler. The organization is based on *The Annotated C++ Reference Manual* by Margaret Ellis and Bjarne Stroustrup and on the ANSI/ISO C++ International Standard (ISO/IEC FDIS 14882). Microsoft-specific implementations of C++ language features are included.

For an overview of Modern C++ programming practices, see [Welcome Back to C++](welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp.md).

See the following tables to quickly find a keyword or operator:

- [C++ Keywords](keywords-cpp.md)
- [C++ Operators](cpp-built-in-operators-precedence-and-associativity.md)

## In This Section

[Lexical Conventions](lexical-conventions.md)\
Fundamental lexical elements of a C++ program: tokens, comments, operators, keywords, punctuators, literals. Also, file translation, operator precedence/associativity.

[Basic Concepts](basic-concepts-cpp.md)\
Scope, linkage, program startup and termination, storage classes, and types.

[Built-in types](fundamental-types-cpp.md)\
The fundamental types that are built into the C++ compiler and their value ranges.

[Standard Conversions](standard-conversions.md)\
Type conversions between built-in types. Also, arithmetic conversions and conversions among pointer, reference, and pointer-to-member types.

[Declarations and definitions](declarations-and-definitions-cpp.md)\
Declaring and defining variables, types and functions.

[Operators, Precedence and Associativity](cpp-built-in-operators-precedence-and-associativity.md)\
The operators in C++.

[Expressions](expressions-cpp.md)\
Types of expressions, semantics of expressions, reference topics on operators, casting and casting operators, run-time type information.

[Lambda Expressions](lambda-expressions-in-cpp.md)\
A programming technique that implicitly defines a function object class and constructs a function object of that class type.

[Statements](statements-cpp.md)\
Expression, null, compound, selection, iteration, jump, and declaration statements.

[Classes and structs](classes-and-structs-cpp.md)\
Introduction to classes, structures, and unions. Also, member functions, special member functions, data members, bit fields, **`this`** pointer, nested classes.

[Unions](unions.md)\
User-defined types in which all members share the same memory location.

[Derived Classes](inheritance-cpp.md)\
Single and multiple inheritance, **`virtual`** functions, multiple base classes, **abstract** classes, scope rules. Also, the **`__super`** and **`__interface`** keywords.

[Member-Access Control](member-access-control-cpp.md)\
Controlling access to class members: **`public`**, **`private`**, and **`protected`** keywords. Friend functions and classes.

[Overloading](operator-overloading.md)\
Overloaded operators, rules for operator overloading.

[Exception Handling](exception-handling-in-visual-cpp.md)\
C++ exception handling, structured exception handling (SEH), keywords used in writing exception handling statements.

[Assertion and User-Supplied Messages](assertion-and-user-supplied-messages-cpp.md)\
`#error` directive, the **`static_assert`** keyword, the `assert` macro.

[Templates](templates-cpp.md)\
Template specifications, function templates, class templates, **`typename`** keyword, templates vs. macros, templates and smart pointers.

[Event Handling](event-handling.md)\
Declaring events and event handlers.

[Microsoft-Specific Modifiers](microsoft-specific-modifiers.md)\
Modifiers specific to Microsoft C++. Memory addressing, calling conventions, **`naked`** functions, extended storage-class attributes (**`__declspec`**), **`__w64`**.

[Inline Assembler](../assembler/inline/inline-assembler.md)\
Using assembly language and C++ in **`__asm`** blocks.

[Compiler COM Support](compiler-com-support.md)\
A reference to Microsoft-specific classes and global functions used to support COM types.

[Microsoft Extensions](microsoft-extensions.md)\
Microsoft extensions to C++.

[Nonstandard Behavior](nonstandard-behavior.md)\
Information about nonstandard behavior of the Microsoft C++ compiler.

[Welcome Back to C++](welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp.md)\
An overview of modern C++ programming practices for writing safe, correct and efficient programs.
