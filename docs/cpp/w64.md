# __w64

**Microsoft Specific** 

This keyword is obsolete. In versions of Visual Studio earlier than Visual Studio 2013, this lets you mark variables, so that when you compile with [/Wp64](../build/reference/wp64-detect-64-bit-portability-issues.md) the compiler will report any warnings that would be reported if you were compiling with a 64-bit compiler.  
  
## Syntax  
  
> *type* **__w64** *identifier*  
 
### Parameters  

*type*  
 One of the three types that could cause problems in code being ported from a 32-bit to a 64-bit compiler: **int**, **long**, or a pointer.  
  
*identifier*  
The identifier for the variable you are creating.  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The [/Wp64](../build/reference/wp64-detect-64-bit-portability-issues.md) compiler option and **__w64** keyword are deprecated in Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 2013 and removed starting in Visual Studio 2013. If you use the `/Wp64` compiler option on the command line, the compiler issues Command-Line Warning D9002. The **__w64** keyword is silently ignored. Instead of using this option and keyword to detect 64-bit portability issues, use a Visual C++ compiler that targets a 64-bit platform. For more information, see [Configure Visual C++ for 64-bit, x64 targets](../build/configuring-programs-for-64-bit-visual-cpp.md).  
  
 Any typedef that has **__w64** on it must be 32 bits on x86 and 64 bits on x64.  
  
 To detect portability issues by using versions of the Visual C++ compiler earlier than Visual Studio 2010, the **__w64** keyword should be specified on any typedefs that change size between 32 bit and 64 bit platforms. For any such type, **__w64** must appear only on the 32-bit definition of the typedef.  
  
 The **__w64** keyword is ignored if the compilation does not use `/Wp64`.  
  
 For more information about porting to 64-bit, see the following topics:  
  
-   [Compiler Options](../build/reference/compiler-options.md)  
  
-   [Porting 32-Bit Code to 64-Bit Code](../build/common-visual-cpp-64-bit-migration-issues.md)  
  
-   [Configure Visual C++ for 64-bit, x64 targets](../build/configuring-programs-for-64-bit-visual-cpp.md)  
  
## Example  
  
```cpp  
// __w64.cpp  
// compile with: /W3 /Wp64  
typedef int Int_32;  
#ifdef _WIN64  
typedef __int64 Int_Native;  
#else  
typedef int __w64 Int_Native;  
#endif  
  
int main() {  
   Int_32 i0 = 5;  
   Int_Native i1 = 10;  
   i0 = i1;   // C4244 64-bit int assigned to 32-bit int  
  
   // char __w64 c;  error, cannot use __w64 on char  
}  
```
