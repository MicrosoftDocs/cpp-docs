# Types of Expressions
C++ expressions are divided into several categories:  
  
-   [Primary expressions](../cpp/primary-expressions.md). These are the building blocks from which all other expressions are formed.  
  
-   [Postfix expressions](../cpp/postfix-expressions.md). These are primary expressions followed by an operator — for example, the array subscript or postfix increment operator.  
  
-   [Expressions formed with unary operators](../cpp/expressions-with-unary-operators.md). Unary operators act on only one operand in an expression.  
  
-   [Expressions formed with binary operators](../cpp/expressions-with-binary-operators.md). Binary operators act on two operands in an expression.  
  
-   [Expressions with the conditional operator](../cpp/conditional-operator-q.md). The conditional operator is a ternary operator — the only such operator in the C++ language — and takes three operands.  
  
-   [Constant expressions](../cpp/cpp-constant-expressions.md). Constant expressions are formed entirely of constant data.  
  
-   [Expressions with explicit type conversions](explicit-type-conversion-operator-parens.md). Explicit type conversions, or "casts," can be used in expressions.  
  
-   [Expressions with pointer-to-member operators](../cpp/pointer-to-member-operators-dot-star-and-star.md).  
  
-   [Casting](../cpp/casting.md). Type-safe "casts" can be used in expressions.  
  
-   [Run-Time Type Information](../cpp/run-time-type-information.md). Determine the type of an object during program execution.
