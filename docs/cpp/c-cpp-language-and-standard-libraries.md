# C/C++ language and standard libraries reference

This section of the documentation contains reference content for the Microsoft implementation of the ISO standard C and C++ languages. The language reference includes documentation for the preprocessor, compiler intrinsics, and supported assembly languages.

You'll also find documentation for the C runtime library, the C++ standard library, and several other libraries available with the Microsoft C/C++ compiler (MSVC) here.

## Language reference

[C language](../c-language/c-language-reference.md)\
Reference content for the Microsoft implementation of the C language.

[C++ language](cpp-language-reference.md)\
Reference content for the Microsoft implementation of the C++ language.

[C/C++ preprocessor](../preprocessor/c-cpp-preprocessor-reference.md)\
Reference content for the preprocessor used by C and C++.

[Compiler intrinsics](../intrinsics/compiler-intrinsics.md)\
Describes intrinsic functions that are available in Microsoft C and C++ for x86, ARM, ARM64, and x64 architectures.

[Inline assembler](../assembler/inline/inline-assembler.md)\
Explains how to use the Visual C/C++ inline assembler with x86 processors.

[ARM assembler reference](../assembler/arm/arm-assembler-reference.md)\
Provides reference material for the Microsoft ARM assembler (ARMASM) and related tools.

[Microsoft macro assembler reference](../assembler/masm/microsoft-macro-assembler-reference.md)\
Provides reference material for the Microsoft Macro assembler (MASM).

## Libraries reference

### Standard libraries

[C runtime library](../c-runtime-library/c-run-time-library-reference.md)\
The reference for the Microsoft implementation of the C runtime library (CRT), sometimes referred to as the Universal CRT.

[C++ standard library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md)\
The reference for the Microsoft implementation of the C++ standard library.

### Libraries for Windows applications

[MFC/ATL](../mfc/mfc-and-atl.md)\
Documentation for the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and Active Template Library (ATL) class libraries.

### Additional libraries

[C++ AMP (C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism)](../parallel/amp/cpp-amp-cpp-accelerated-massive-parallelism.md)\
Classes that enable the use of modern graphics processors for general purpose programming.

[Concurrency Runtime](../parallel/concrt/concurrency-runtime.md)\
Classes that simplify the writing of programs that use data parallelism or task parallelism.

[OpenMP](../parallel/openmp/openmp-in-visual-cpp.md)\
Reference for the Microsoft implementation of the OpenMP API.

[Proxy library](https://github.com/microsoft/proxy)\
A header-only C++20 library for using polymorphism in C++ without inheritance. For API reference information, see [Proxy 3 Specifications](https://microsoft.github.io/proxy/docs/specifications.html)

[SafeInt library](../safeint/safeint-library.md)\
A portable library that can be used with MSVC, GCC, or Clang to help prevent integer overflows.

[Data Access Libraries](../data/data-access-in-cpp.md)\
Libraries to support data access using ATL or MFC, and legacy services such as OLE DB and ODBC.
