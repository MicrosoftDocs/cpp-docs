# Compound Statements (Blocks)
A compound statement consists of zero or more statements enclosed in curly braces (**{ }**). A compound statement can be used anywhere a statement is expected. Compound statements are commonly called "blocks."  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
{ [ statement-list ] }  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The following example uses a compound statement as the *statement* part of the **if** statement (see [The if Statement](../cpp/if-else-statement-cpp.md) for details about the syntax):  
  
```cpp 
if( Amount > 100 )  
{  
    cout << "Amount was too large to handle\n";  
    Alert();  
}  
else  
{
    Balance -= Amount;  
}
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Because a declaration is a statement, a declaration can be one of the statements in the *statement-list*. As a result, names declared inside a compound statement, but not explicitly declared as static, have local scope and (for objects) lifetime. See [Scope](../cpp/scope-visual-cpp.md) for details about treatment of names with local scope.
