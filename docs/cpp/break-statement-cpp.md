# break Statement (C++)
The **break** statement ends execution of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement in which it appears. Control passes to the statement that follows the end of the statement, if any.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
break;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The **break** statement is used with the conditional [switch](../cpp/switch-statement-cpp.md) statement and with the [do](../cpp/do-while-statement-cpp.md), [for](../cpp/for-statement-cpp.md), and [while](../cpp/while-statement-cpp.md) loop statements.  
  
 In a **switch** statement, the **break** statement causes the program to execute the next statement outside the **switch** statement. Without a **break** statement, every statement from the matched **case** label to the end of the **switch** statement, including the **default** clause, is executed.  
  
 In loops, the **break** statement ends execution of the nearest enclosing **do**, **for**, or **while** statement. Control passes to the statement that follows the ended statement, if any.  
  
 Within nested statements, the **break** statement ends only the **do**, **for**, **switch**, or **while** statement that immediately encloses it. You can use a **return** or **goto** statement to transfer control from more deeply nested structures.  
  
## Example  
 The following code shows how to use the **break** statement in a **for** loop.  
  
```cpp  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
  
int main()  
{  
    // An example of a standard for loop  
    for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++)  
    {  
        if (i == 4) {  
            break;  
        }  
        cout << i << '\n';  
    }  
  
    // An example of a range-based for loop  
int nums []{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};  
  
    for (int i : nums) {  
        if (i == 4) {  
            break;  
        }  
        cout << i << '\n';  
    }  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
In each case:   
1  
2  
3  
```  
  
 The following code shows how to use **break** in a **while** loop and a **do** loop.  
  
```cpp  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
  
int main() {  
    int i = 0;  
  
    while (i < 10) {  
        if (i == 4) {  
            break;  
        }  
        cout << i << '\n';  
        i++;  
    }  
  
    i = 0;  
    do {  
        if (i == 4) {  
            break;  
        }  
        cout << i << '\n';  
        i++;  
    } while (i < 10);  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
In each case:  
0123  
```  
  
 The following code shows how to use **break** in a switch statement. You must use **break** in every case if you want to handle each case separately; if you do not use **break**, the code execution falls through to the next case.  
  
```cpp  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
  
enum Suit{ Diamonds, Hearts, Clubs, Spades };  
  
int main() {  
  
    Suit hand;  
    . . .  
    // Assume that some enum value is set for hand  
    // In this example, each case is handled separately  
    switch (hand)  
    {  
    case Diamonds:  
        cout << "got Diamonds \n";  
        break;  
    case Hearts:  
        cout << "got Hearts \n";  
        break;  
    case Clubs:  
        cout << "got Clubs \n";  
        break;  
    case Spades:  
        cout << "got Spades \n";  
        break;  
    default:   
          cout << "didn't get card \n";  
    }  
    // In this example, Diamonds and Hearts are handled one way, and  
    // Clubs, Spades, and the default value are handled another way  
    switch (hand)  
    {  
    case Diamonds:  
    case Hearts:  
        cout << "got a red card \n";  
        break;  
    case Clubs:  
    case Spades:   
    default:  
        cout << "didn't get a red card \n";  
    }  
}  
```
