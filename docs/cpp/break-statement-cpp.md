# `break` statement (C++)

The **`break`** statement ends execution of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement in which it appears. Control passes to the statement that follows the end of the statement, if any.

## Syntax

```cpp
break;
```

## Remarks

The **`break`** statement is used with the conditional [`switch`](../cpp/switch-statement-cpp.md) statement and with the [`do`](../cpp/do-while-statement-cpp.md), [`for`](../cpp/for-statement-cpp.md), and [`while`](../cpp/while-statement-cpp.md) loop statements.

In a **`switch`** statement, the **`break`** statement causes the program to execute the next statement outside the **`switch`** statement. Without a **`break`** statement, every statement from the matched **`case`** label to the end of the **`switch`** statement, including the **`default`** clause, is executed.

In loops, the **`break`** statement ends execution of the nearest enclosing **`do`**, **`for`**, or **`while`** statement. Control passes to the statement that follows the ended statement, if any.

Within nested statements, the **`break`** statement ends only the **`do`**, **`for`**, **`switch`**, or **`while`** statement that immediately encloses it. You can use a **`return`** or **`goto`** statement to transfer control from more deeply nested structures.

## Example

The following code shows how to use the **`break`** statement in a **`for`** loop.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // An example of a standard for loop
    for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
    {
        if (i == 4) {
            break;
        }
        cout << i << '\n';
    }

    // An example of a range-based for loop
int nums []{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

    for (int i : nums) {
        if (i == 4) {
            break;
        }
        cout << i << '\n';
    }
}
```

```Output
1
2
3
1
2
3
```

The following code shows how to use **`break`** in a **`while`** loop and a **`do`** loop.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i = 0;

    while (i < 10) {
        if (i == 4) {
            break;
        }
        cout << i << '\n';
        i++;
    }

    i = 0;
    do {
        if (i == 4) {
            break;
        }
        cout << i << '\n';
        i++;
    } while (i < 10);
}
```

```Output
0
1
2
3
0
1
2
3
```

The following code shows how to use **`break`** in a switch statement. You must use **`break`** in every case if you want to handle each case separately; if you do not use **`break`**, the code execution falls through to the next case.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

enum Suit{ Diamonds, Hearts, Clubs, Spades };

int main() {

    Suit hand;
    . . .
    // Assume that some enum value is set for hand
    // In this example, each case is handled separately
    switch (hand)
    {
    case Diamonds:
        cout << "got Diamonds \n";
        break;
    case Hearts:
        cout << "got Hearts \n";
        break;
    case Clubs:
        cout << "got Clubs \n";
        break;
    case Spades:
        cout << "got Spades \n";
        break;
    default:
          cout << "didn't get card \n";
    }
    // In this example, Diamonds and Hearts are handled one way, and
    // Clubs, Spades, and the default value are handled another way
    switch (hand)
    {
    case Diamonds:
    case Hearts:
        cout << "got a red card \n";
        break;
    case Clubs:
    case Spades:
    default:
        cout << "didn't get a red card \n";
    }
}
```
