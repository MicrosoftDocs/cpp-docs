# Specifiers
This topic describes the *decl-specifiers* (declaration specifiers) component of a [declaration](declarations-and-definitions-cpp.md).  
  
 The following placeholders and language keywords are declaration specifiers:  
  
 *storage-class-specifier*  
  
 *type-specifier*  
  
 *function-specifier*  
  
 [friend](../cpp/friend-cpp.md)  
  
 [typedef]( [typedef](http://msdn.microsod) `(` *extended-decl-modifier-seq* `)`  
  
## Remarks  
 The *decl-specifiers* part of a declaration is the longest sequence of *decl-specifiers* that can be taken to mean a type name, not including the pointer or reference modifiers. The remainder of the declaration is the *declarator*, which includes the name introduced.  
  
 The following table lists four declarations, and then lists each declaration's *decl-specifers* and *declarator* component separately.  
  
|Declaration|*decl-specifiers*|`declarator`|  
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|  
|`char *lpszAppName;`|**char**|`*lpszAppName`|  
|`typedef char * LPSTR;`|**char**|`*LPSTR`|  
|`const int func1();`|**const int**|`func1`|  
|`volatile void *pvvObj;`|**volatile void**|`*pvvObj`|  
  
 Because **signed**, **unsigned**, **long**, and **short** all imply **int**, a **typedef** name following one of these keywords is taken to be a member of *declarator-list,* not of *decl-specifiers*.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Because a name can be redeclared, its interpretation is subject to the most recent declaration in the current scope. Redeclaration can affect how names are interpreted by the compiler, especially **typedef** names.
