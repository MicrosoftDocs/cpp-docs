# Basic Concepts (C++)

This section explains concepts that are critical to understanding C++. C programmers will be familiar with many of these concepts, but there are some subtle differences that can cause unexpected program results. The following topics are included:

- [C++ type system](cpp-type-system-modern-cpp.md)
- [Scope](scope-visual-cpp.md)
- [Translation units and linkage](program-and-linkage-cpp.md)
- [main function and command-line arguments](main-function-command-line-args.md)
- [Program termination](program-termination.md)
- [Lvalues and rvalues](lvalues-and-rvalues-visual-cpp.md)
- [Temporary objects](temporary-objects.md)
- [Alignment](alignment-cpp-declarations.md)
- [Trivial, standard-layout and POD types](trivial-standard-layout-and-pod-types.md)
