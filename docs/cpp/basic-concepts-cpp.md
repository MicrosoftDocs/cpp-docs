# Basic Concepts  (C++)

This section explains concepts that are critical to understanding C++. C programmers will be familiar with many of these concepts, but there are some subtle differences that can cause unexpected program results. The following topics are included:

- [C++ type system](cpp-type-system-modern-cpp.md)

- [Declarations and definitions](../cpp/declarations-and-definitions-cpp.md)

- [Scope of a C++ object or function](../cpp/scope-visual-cpp.md)

- [Program definition and linkage rules](../cpp/program-and-linkage-cpp.md)

- [Startup and termination](../cpp/startup-and-termination-cpp.md)

- [L-values and r-values](../cpp/lvalues-and-rvalues-visual-cpp.md)

- [Temporary Objects](../cpp/temporary-objects.md)

- [Alignment](../cpp/alignment-cpp-declarations.md)

- [alignof and alignas](../cpp/alignof-and-alignas-cpp.md)

- [Trivial, standard-layout and POD types](../cpp/trivial-standard-layout-and-pod-types.md)
