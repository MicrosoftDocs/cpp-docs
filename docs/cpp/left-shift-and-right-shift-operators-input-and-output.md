# Left Shift and Right Shift Operators (&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;)

The bitwise shift operators are the right-shift operator (>>), which moves the bits of *shift-expression* to the right, and the left-shift operator (<<), which moves the bits of *shift-expression* to the left. <sup>1</sup>

## Syntax

> *shift-expression* `<<` *additive-expression*  
> *shift-expression* `>>` *additive-expression*

## Remarks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following descriptions and examples are valid on Windows for x86 and x64 architectures. The implementation of left-shift and right-shift operators is significantly different on Windows for ARM devices. For more information, see the "Shift Operators" section of the [Hello ARM](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2012/10/25/hello-arm-exploring-undefined-unspecified-and-implementation-defined-behavior-in-c.aspx) blog post.

## Left Shifts

The left-shift operator causes the bits in *shift-expression* to be shifted to the left by the number of positions specified by *additive-expression*. The bit positions that have been vacated by the shift operation are zero-filled. A left shift is a logical shift (the bits that are shifted off the end are discarded, including the sign bit). For more information about the kinds of bitwise shifts, see [Bitwise shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_shift).

The following example shows left-shift operations using unsigned numbers. The example shows what is happening to the bits by representing the value as a bitset. For more information, see [bitset Class](../standard-library/bitset-class.md).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    unsigned short short1 = 4;
    bitset<16> bitset1{short1};   // the bitset representation of 4
    cout << bitset1 << endl;  // 0b00000000'00000100

    unsigned short short2 = short1 << 1;     // 4 left-shifted by 1 = 8
    bitset<16> bitset2{short2};
    cout << bitset2 << endl;  // 0b00000000'00001000

    unsigned short short3 = short1 << 2;     // 4 left-shifted by 2 = 16
    bitset<16> bitset3{short3};
    cout << bitset3 << endl;  // 0b00000000'00010000
}
```

If you left-shift a signed number so that the sign bit is affected, the result is undefined. The following example shows what happens in Visual C++ when a 1 bit is left-shifted into the sign bit position.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    short short1 = 16384;
    bitset<16> bitset1(short1);
    cout << bitset1 << endl;  // 0b01000000'00000000

    short short3 = short1 << 1;
    bitset<16> bitset3(short3);  // 16384 left-shifted by 1 = -32768
    cout << bitset3 << endl;  // 0b10000000'00000000

    short short4 = short1 << 14;
    bitset<16> bitset4(short4);  // 4 left-shifted by 14 = 0
    cout << bitset4 << endl;  // 0b00000000'00000000
}
```

## Right Shifts

The right-shift operator causes the bit pattern in *shift-expression* to be shifted to the right by the number of positions specified by *additive-expression*. For unsigned numbers, the bit positions that have been vacated by the shift operation are zero-filled. For signed numbers, the sign bit is used to fill the vacated bit positions. In other words, if the number is positive, 0 is used, and if the number is negative, 1 is used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The result of a right-shift of a signed negative number is implementation-dependent. Although Visual C++ uses the sign bit to fill vacated bit positions, there is no guarantee that other implementations also do so.

This example shows right-shift operations using unsigned numbers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    unsigned short short11 = 1024;
    bitset<16> bitset11{short11};
    cout << bitset11 << endl;     // 0b00000100'00000000

    unsigned short short12 = short11 >> 1;  // 512
    bitset<16> bitset12{short12};
    cout << bitset12 << endl;     // 0b00000010'00000000

    unsigned short short13 = short11 >> 10;  // 1
    bitset<16> bitset13{short13};
    cout << bitset13 << endl;     // 0b00000000'00000001

    unsigned short short14 = short11 >> 11;  // 0
    bitset<16> bitset14{short14};
    cout << bitset14 << endl;     // 0b00000000'00000000
}
```

The next example shows right-shift operations with positive signed numbers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    short short1 = 1024;
    bitset<16> bitset1(short1);
    cout << bitset1 << endl;     // 0b00000100'00000000

    short short2 = short1 >> 1;  // 512
    bitset<16> bitset2(short2);
    cout << bitset2 << endl;     // 0b00000010'00000000

    short short3 = short1 >> 11;  // 0
    bitset<16> bitset3(short3);
    cout << bitset3 << endl;     // 0b00000000'00000000
}
```

The next example shows right-shift operations with negative signed integers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    short neg1 = -16;
    bitset<16> bn1(neg1);
    cout << bn1 << endl;  // 0b11111111'11110000

    short neg2 = neg1 >> 1; // -8
    bitset<16> bn2(neg2);
    cout << bn2 << endl;  // 0b11111111'11111000

    short neg3 = neg1 >> 2; // -4
    bitset<16> bn3(neg3);
    cout << bn3 << endl;  // 0b11111111'11111100

    short neg4 = neg1 >> 4; // -1
    bitset<16> bn4(neg4);
    cout << bn4 << endl;  // 0b11111111'11111111

    short neg5 = neg1 >> 5; // -1
    bitset<16> bn5(neg5);
    cout << bn5 << endl;  // 0b11111111'11111111  
}
```

## Shifts and Promotions

The expressions on both sides of a shift operator must be integral types. Integral promotions are performed according to the rules described in [Standard Conversions](standard-conversions.md). The type of the result is the same as the type of the promoted *shift-expression*.

In the following example, a variable of type **char** is promoted to an **int**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    char char1 = 'a';

    auto promoted1 = char1 << 1;   // 194
    cout << typeid(promoted1).name() << endl;  // int

    auto promoted2 = char1 << 10;  // 99328
    cout << typeid(promoted2).name() << endl;  // int
}
```

## Additional Details

The result of a shift operation is undefined if *additive-expression* is negative or if *additive-expression* is greater than or equal to the number of bits in the (promoted) *shift-expression*. No shift operation is performed if *additive-expression* is 0.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    unsigned int int1 = 4;
    bitset<32> b1{int1};
    cout << b1 << endl;    // 0b00000000'00000000'00000000'00000100

    unsigned int int2 = int1 << -3;  // C4293: '<<' : shift count negative or too big, undefined behavior
    unsigned int int3 = int1 >> -3;  // C4293: '>>' : shift count negative or too big, undefined behavior
    unsigned int int4 = int1 << 32;  // C4293: '<<' : shift count negative or too big, undefined behavior
    unsigned int int5 = int1 >> 32;  // C4293: '>>' : shift count negative or too big, undefined behavior
    unsigned int int6 = int1 << 0;
    bitset<32> b6{int6};
    cout << b6 << endl;    // 0b00000000'00000000'00000000'00000100 (no change)
}
```

## Footnotes

<sup>1</sup> The following is the description of the shift operators in the C++11 ISO specification (INCITS/ISO/IEC 14882-2011[2012]), sections 5.8.2 and 5.8.3.

The value of `E1 << E2` is `E1` left-shifted `E2` bit positions; vacated bits are zero-filled. If `E1` has an unsigned type, the value of the result is **E1 × 2**<sup>**E2**</sup>, reduced modulo one more than the maximum value representable in the result type. Otherwise, if `E1` has a signed type and non-negative value, and **E1 × 2**<sup>**E2**</sup> is representable in the corresponding unsigned type of the result type, then that value, converted to the result type, is the resulting value; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

The value of `E1 >> E2` is `E1` right-shifted `E2` bit positions. If `E1` has an unsigned type or if `E1` has a signed type and a non-negative value, the value of the result is the integral part of the quotient of **E1/2**<sup>**E2**</sup>. If `E1` has a signed type and a negative value, the resulting value is implementation-defined.
