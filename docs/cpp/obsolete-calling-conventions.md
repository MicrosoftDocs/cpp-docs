# Obsolete Calling Conventions
## Microsoft Specific  
 The **__pascal**, **__fortran**, and **__syscall** calling conventions are no longer supported. You can emulate their functionality by using one of the supported calling conventions and appropriate linker options.  
  
 \<windows.h> now supports the WINAPI macro, which translates to the appropriate calling convention for the target. Use WINAPI where you previously used PASCAL or **__far \__pascal**.
