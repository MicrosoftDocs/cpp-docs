# __stdcall

**Microsoft Specific**

The **__stdcall** calling convention is used to call Win32 API functions. The callee cleans the stack, so the compiler makes `vararg` functions **__cdecl**. Functions that use this calling convention require a function prototype.

## Syntax

> *return-type* **\_\_stdcall** *function-name*[**(** *argument-list* **)**]

## Remarks

The following list shows the implementation of this calling convention.

|Element|Implementation|
|-------------|--------------------|
|Argument-passing order|Right to left.|
|Argument-passing convention|By value, unless a pointer or reference type is passed.|
|Stack-maintenance responsibility|Called function pops its own arguments from the stack.|
|Name-decoration convention|An underscore (_) is prefixed to the name. The name is followed by the at sign (@) followed by the number of bytes (in decimal) in the argument list. Therefore, the function declared as `int func( int a, double b )` is decorated as follows: `_func@12`|
|Case-translation convention|None|

The [/Gz](../build/reference/gd-gr-gv-gz-calling-convention.md) compiler option specifies **__stdcall** for all functions not explicitly declared with a different calling convention.

Functions declared using the **__stdcall** modifier return values the same way as functions declared using [__cdecl](../cpp/cdecl.md).

On ARM and x64 processors, **__stdcall** is accepted and ignored by the compiler; on ARM and x64 architectures, by convention, arguments are passed in registers when possible, and subsequent arguments are passed on the stack.

For non-static class functions, if the function is defined out-of-line, the calling convention modifier does not have to be specified on the out-of-line definition. That is, for class non-static member methods, the calling convention specified during declaration is assumed at the point of definition. Given this class definition,

```cpp
struct CMyClass {  
   void __stdcall mymethod();
};
```

this

```cpp
void CMyClass::mymethod() { return; }  
```

is equivalent to this

```cpp
void __stdcall CMyClass::mymethod() { return; }  
```

## Example

In the following example, use of **__stdcall** results in all `WINAPI` function types being handled as a standard call:

```cpp
// Example of the __stdcall keyword
#define WINAPI __stdcall
// Example of the __stdcall keyword on function pointer
typedef BOOL (__stdcall *funcname_ptr)(void * arg1, const char * arg2, DWORD flags, ...);
```
