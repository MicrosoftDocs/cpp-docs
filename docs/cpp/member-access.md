# Member Access

Class member access can be controlled by overloading the member access operator (**->**). This operator is considered a unary operator in this usage, and the overloaded operator function must be a class member function. Therefore, the declaration for such a function is:

## Syntax

```
class-type *operator->()
```

## Remarks

where *class-type* is the name of the class to which this operator belongs. The member access operator function must be a nonstatic member function.

This operator is used (often in conjunction with the pointer-dereference operator) to implement "smart pointers" that validate pointers prior to dereference or count usage.

The **.** member access operator cannot be overloaded.
