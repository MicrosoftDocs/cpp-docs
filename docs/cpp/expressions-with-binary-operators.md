# Expressions with Binary Operators
Binary operators act on two operands in an expression. The binary operators are:  
  
-   [Multiplicative operators](../cpp/multiplicative-operators-and-the-modulus-operator.md)  
  
    -   Multiplication (*)  
  
    -   Division (/)  
  
    -   Modulus (%)  
  
-   [Additive operators](../cpp/additive-operators-plus-and.md)  
  
    -   Addition (+)  
  
    -   Subtraction (–)  
  
-   [Shift operators](../cpp/left-shift-and-right-shift-operators-input-and-output.md)  
  
    -   Right shift (>>)  
  
    -   Left shift (<<)  
  
-   [Relational and equality operators](../cpp/relational-operators-equal-and-equal.md)  
  
    -   Less than (\<)  
  
    -   Greater than (>)  
  
    -   Less than or equal to (\<=)  
  
    -   Greater than or equal to (>=)  
  
    -   Equal to (==)  
  
    -   Not equal to (!=)  
  
-   Bitwise operators  
  
    -   [Bitwise AND (&)](../cpp/bitwise-and-operator-amp.md)  
  
    -   [Bitwise exclusive OR (^)](../cpp/bitwise-exclusive-or-operator-hat.md)  
  
    -   [Bitwise inclusive OR (&#124;)](../cpp/bitwise-inclusive-or-operator-pipe.md)  
  
-   Logical operators  
  
    -   [Logical AND (&&)](../cpp/logical-and-operator-amp-amp.md)  
  
    -   [Logical OR (&#124;&#124;)](../cpp/logical-or-operator-pipe-pipe.md)  
  
-   [Assignment operators](../cpp/assignment-operators.md)  
  
    -   Assignment (=)  
  
    -   Addition assignment (+=)  
  
    -   Subtraction assignment (–=)  
  
    -   Multiplication assignment (*=)  
  
    -   Division assignment (/=)  
  
    -   Modulus assignment (%=)  
  
    -   Left shift assignment (<\<=)  
  
    -   Right shift assignment (>>=)  
  
    -   Bitwise AND assignment (&=)  
  
    -   Bitwise exclusive OR assignment (^=)  
  
    -   Bitwise inclusive OR assignment (&#124;=)  
  
-   [Comma Operator](../cpp/comma-operator.md) (,)
