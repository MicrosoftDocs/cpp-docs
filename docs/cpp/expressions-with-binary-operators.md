# Expressions with Binary Operators

Binary operators act on two operands in an expression. The binary operators are:

- [Multiplicative operators](../cpp/multiplicative-operators-and-the-modulus-operator.md)

  - Multiplication (*)

  - Division (/)

  - Modulus (%)

- [Additive operators](../cpp/additive-operators-plus-and.md)

  - Addition (+)

  - Subtraction (-)

- [Shift operators](../cpp/left-shift-and-right-shift-operators-input-and-output.md)

  - Right shift (>>)

  - Left shift (<<)

- [Relational and equality operators](../cpp/relational-operators-equal-and-equal.md)

  - Less than (\<)

  - Greater than (>)

  - Less than or equal to (\<=)

  - Greater than or equal to (>=)

  - Equal to (==)

  - Not equal to (!=)

- Bitwise operators

  - [Bitwise AND (&)](../cpp/bitwise-and-operator-amp.md)

  - [Bitwise exclusive OR (^)](../cpp/bitwise-exclusive-or-operator-hat.md)

  - [Bitwise inclusive OR (&#124;)](../cpp/bitwise-inclusive-or-operator-pipe.md)

- Logical operators

  - [Logical AND (&&)](../cpp/logical-and-operator-amp-amp.md)

  - [Logical OR (&#124;&#124;)](../cpp/logical-or-operator-pipe-pipe.md)

- [Assignment operators](../cpp/assignment-operators.md)

  - Assignment (=)

  - Addition assignment (+=)

  - Subtraction assignment (-=)

  - Multiplication assignment (*=)

  - Division assignment (/=)

  - Modulus assignment (%=)

  - Left shift assignment (<\<=)

  - Right shift assignment (>>=)

  - Bitwise AND assignment (&=)

  - Bitwise exclusive OR assignment (^=)

  - Bitwise inclusive OR assignment (&#124;=)

- [Comma Operator](../cpp/comma-operator.md) (,)
