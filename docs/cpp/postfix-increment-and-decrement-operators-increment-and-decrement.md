# Postfix Increment and Decrement Operators: ++ and --
## Syntax  
  
```  
postfix-expression ++  
postfix-expression --  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 C++ provides prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators; this section describes only the postfix increment and decrement operators. (For more information, see [Prefix Increment and Decrement Operators](../cpp/prefix-increment-and-decrement-operators-increment-and-decrement.md).) The difference between the two is that in the postfix notation, the operator appears after *postfix-expression*, whereas in the prefix notation, the operator appears before *expression.* The following example shows a postfix-increment operator:  
  
```cpp 
i++;  
```  
  
 The effect of applying the postfix increment operator (**++**) is that the operand's value is increased by one unit of the appropriate type. Similarly, the effect of applying the postfix decrement operator (**--**) is that the operand's value is decreased by one unit of the appropriate type.  
  
 It is important to note that a postfix increment or decrement expression evaluates to the value of the expression *prior to* application of the respective operator. The increment or decrement operation occurs *after* the operand is evaluated. This issue arises only when the postfix increment or decrement operation occurs in the context of a larger expression.  
  
 When a postfix operator is applied to a function argument, the value of the argument is not guaranteed to be incremented or decremented before it is passed to the function.  See section 1.9.17 in the C++ standard for more information.  
  
 Applying the postfix increment operator to a pointer to an array of objects of type **long** actually adds four to the internal representation of the pointer. This behavior causes the pointer, which previously referred to the *n*th element of the array, to refer to the (*n*+1)th element.  
  
 The operands to postfix increment and postfix decrement operators must be modifiable (not **const**) l-values of arithmetic or pointer type. The type of the result is the same as that of the *postfix-expression*, but it is no longer an l-value.  
  
**Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 and later** (available with [/std:c++17](../build/reference/std-specify-language-standard-version.md)): The operand of a postfix increment  or decrement operator may not be of type **bool**.
  
 The following code illustrates the postfix increment operator:  
  
```cpp 
// expre_Postfix_Increment_and_Decrement_Operators.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
  
int main() {  
   int i = 10;  
   cout << i++ << endl;  
   cout << i << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 Postincrement and postdecrement operations on enumerated types are not supported:  
  
```cpp 
enum Compass { North, South, East, West );  
Compass myCompass;  
for( myCompass = North; myCompass != West; myCompass++ ) // Error  
```
