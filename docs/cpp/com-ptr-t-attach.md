# _com_ptr_t::Attach

**Microsoft Specific**

Encapsulates a raw interface pointer of this smart pointer's type.

## Syntax

```
void Attach( Interface* pInterface ) throw( );
void Attach( Interface* pInterface, bool fAddRef ) throw( );
```

#### Parameters

*pInterface*<br/>
A raw interface pointer.

*fAddRef*<br/>
If it is TRUE, then `AddRef` is called. If it is FALSE, the `_com_ptr_t` object takes ownership of the raw interface pointer without calling `AddRef`.

## Remarks

- **Attach(**  *pInterface*  **)** `AddRef` is not called. The ownership of the interface is passed to this `_com_ptr_t` object. `Release` is called to decrement the reference count for the previously encapsulated pointer.

- **Attach(**  *pInterface* **,**  *fAddRef*  **)** If *fAddRef* is TRUE, `AddRef` is called to increment the reference count for the encapsulated interface pointer. If *fAddRef* is FALSE, this `_com_ptr_t` object takes ownership of the raw interface pointer without calling `AddRef`. `Release` is called to decrement the reference count for the previously encapsulated pointer.
