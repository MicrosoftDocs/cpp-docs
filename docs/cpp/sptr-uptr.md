# __sptr, __uptr
**Microsoft Specific**  
 Use the **__sptr** or **__uptr** modifier on a 32-bit pointer declaration to specify how the compiler converts a 32-bit pointer to a 64-bit pointer. A 32-bit pointer is converted, for example, when it is assigned to a 64-bit pointer variable or is dereferenced on a 64-bit platform.  
  
 Microsoft documentation for support of 64-bit platforms sometimes refers to the most significant bit of a 32-bit pointer as the sign bit. By default, the compiler uses sign extension to convert a 32-bit pointer to a 64-bit pointer. That is, the least significant 32 bits of the 64-bit pointer are set to the value of the 32-bit pointer and the most significant 32 bits are set to the value of the sign bit of the 32-bit pointer. This conversion yields correct results if the sign bit is 0, but not if the sign bit is 1. For example, the 32-bit address 0x7FFFFFFF yields the equivalent 64-bit address 0x000000007FFFFFFF, but the 32-bit address 0x80000000 is incorrectly changed to 0xFFFFFFFF80000000.  
  
 The **__sptr**, or signed pointer, modifier specifies that a pointer conversion set the most significant bits of a 64-bit pointer to the sign bit of the 32-bit pointer. The **__uptr**, or unsigned pointer, modifier specifies that a conversion set the most significant bits to zero. The following declarations show the **__sptr** and **__uptr** modifiers used with two unqualified pointers, two pointers qualified with the [__ptr32](../cpp/ptr32-ptr64.md) type, and a function parameter.  
  
```cpp 
int * __sptr psp;  
int * __uptr pup;  
int * __ptr32 __sptr psp32;  
int * __ptr32 __uptr pup32;  
void MyFunction(char * __uptr __ptr32 myValue);  
```  
  
 Use the **__sptr** and **__uptr** modifiers with pointer declarations. Use the modifiers in the position of a [pointer type qualifier](../c-language/pointer-declarations.md), which means the modifier must follow the asterisk. You cannot use the modifiers with [pointers to members](../cpp/pointers-to-members.md). The modifiers do not affect non-pointer declarations.  
  
## Example  
 The following example declares 32-bit pointers that use the **__sptr** and **__uptr** modifiers, assigns each 32-bit pointer to a 64-bit pointer variable, and then displays the hexadecimal value of each 64-bit pointer. The example is compiled with the native 64-bit compiler and is executed on a 64-bit platform.  
  
```cpp  
// sptr_uptr.cpp  
// processor: x64  
#include "stdio.h"  
  
int main()  
{  
    void *        __ptr64 p64;  
    void *        __ptr32 p32d; //default signed pointer  
    void * __sptr __ptr32 p32s; //explicit signed pointer  
    void * __uptr __ptr32 p32u; //explicit unsigned pointer  
  
// Set the 32-bit pointers to a value whose sign bit is 1.  
    p32d = reinterpret_cast<void *>(0x87654321);  
    p32s = p32d;  
    p32u = p32d;  
  
// The printf() function automatically displays leading zeroes with each 32-bit pointer. These are unrelated   
// to the __sptr and __uptr modifiers.   
    printf("Display each 32-bit pointer (as an unsigned 64-bit pointer):\n");  
    printf("p32d:       %p\n", p32d);   
    printf("p32s:       %p\n", p32s);  
    printf("p32u:       %p\n", p32u);  
  
    printf("\nDisplay the 64-bit pointer created from each 32-bit pointer:\n");  
    p64 = p32d;   
    printf("p32d: p64 = %p\n", p64);  
    p64 = p32s;  
    printf("p32s: p64 = %p\n", p64);  
    p64 = p32u;  
    printf("p32u: p64 = %p\n", p64);  
    return 0;  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
Display each 32-bit pointer (as an unsigned 64-bit pointer):  
p32d:       0000000087654321  
p32s:       0000000087654321  
p32u:       0000000087654321  
  
Display the 64-bit pointer created from each 32-bit pointer:  
p32d: p64 = FFFFFFFF87654321  
p32s: p64 = FFFFFFFF87654321  
p32u: p64 = 0000000087654321  
```
