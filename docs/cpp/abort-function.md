# abort Function

The **abort** function, also declared in the standard include file \<stdlib.h>, terminates a C++ program. The difference between `exit` and **abort** is that `exit` allows the C++ run-time termination processing to take place (global object destructors will be called), whereas **abort** terminates the program immediately. For more information, see [abort](../c-runtime-library/reference/abort.md) in the *Run-Time Library Reference*.
