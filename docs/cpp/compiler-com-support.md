# Compiler COM Support
## Microsoft Specific  
 The Visual C++ compiler can directly read component object model (COM) type libraries and translate the contents into C++ source code that can be included in the compilation. Language extensions are available to facilitate COM programming on the client side.  
  
 By using the [#import preprocessor directive](../preprocessor/hash-import-directive-cpp.md), the compiler can read a type library and convert it into a C++ header file that describes the COM interfaces as classes. A set of `#import` attributes is available for user control of the content for the resulting type library header files.  
  
 You can use the [__declspec](../cpp/declspec.md) extended attribute [uuid](../cpp/uuid-cpp.md) to assign a globally unique identifier (GUID) to a COM object. The keyword [__uuidof](../cpp/uuidof-operator.md) can be used to extract the GUID associated with a COM object. Another `__declspec` attribute, [property](../cpp/property-cpp.md), can be used to specify the **get** and **set** methods for a data member of a COM object.  
  
 A set of COM support global functions and classes is provided to support the `VARIANT` and `BSTR` types, implement smart pointers, and encapsulate the error object thrown by `_com_raise_error`:

-   [_com_error](../cpp/com-error-class.md)  
  
-   [_com_ptr_t](../cpp/com-ptr-t-class.md)  
  
-   [_variant_t](../cpp/variant-t-class.md)
