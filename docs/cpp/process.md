# process

Specifies that your managed application process should have a single copy of a particular global variable, static member variable, or static local variable shared across all application domains in the process. This was primarily intended to be used when compiling with **/clr:pure**, which is deprecated in Visual Studio 2017 and unsupported in Visual Studio 2017. When compiling with **/clr**, global and static variables are per-process by default and do not need to use **__declspec(process)**.

Only a global variable, a static member variable, or a static local variable of native type can be marked with **__declspec(process)**.

**process** is only valid when compiling with [/clr](../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md).

If you want each application domain to have its own copy of a global variable, use [appdomain](../cpp/appdomain.md).

See [Application Domains and Visual C++](../dotnet/application-domains-and-visual-cpp.md) for more information.
