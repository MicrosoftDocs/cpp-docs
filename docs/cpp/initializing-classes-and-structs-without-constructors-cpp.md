# Initializing classes and structs without constructors (C++)
It is not always necessary to define a constructor for a class, especially ones that are relatively simple. Users can initialize objects of a class or struct by using uniform initialization, as shown in the following example:  
  
```  
#include "stdafx.h"  
#include <Windows.h>  
  
// No constructor  
struct TempData  
{  
    int StationId;  
    time_t time;  
    double current;  
    double maxTemp;  
    double minTemp;  
};  
  
// Has a constructor  
struct TempData2  
{  
    TempData2(double minimum, double maximum, double cur, int id, time_t t) :  
       minTemp(minimum), maxTemp(maximum), current(cur), stationId(id), time(t) {}  
    int stationId;  
    time_t time;  
    double current;  
    double maxTemp;  
    double minTemp;  
};  
  
int main()  
{  
    // Member initialization (in order of declaration):  
    TempData td{ 45978, GetCurrentTime(), 28.9, 37.0, 16.7 };  
  
    // Default initialization = {0,0,0,0,0}  
    TempData td_default{};  
  
    //Error C4700 uninitialized local variable  
    TempData td_noInit;  
  
    // Member declaration (in order of ctor parameters)  
    TempData2 td2{ 16.7, 37.0, 28.9, 45978, GetCurrentTime() };  
  
    return 0;  
}  
  
```  
  
 Note that when a class or struct has no constructor, you provide the list elements in the order that the members are declared in the class. If the class has a constructor, provide the elements in the order of the parameters.
