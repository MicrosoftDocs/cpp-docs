# return Statement (C++)
Terminates the execution of a function and returns control to the calling function (or to the operating system if you transfer control from the `main` function). Execution resumes in the calling function at the point immediately following the call.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
return [expression];  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The `expression` clause, if present, is converted to the type specified in the function declaration, as if an initialization were being performed. Conversion from the type of the expression to the **return** type of the function can create temporary objects. For more information about how and when temporaries are created, see [Temporary Objects](../cpp/temporary-objects.md).  
  
 The value of the `expression` clause is returned to the calling function. If the expression is omitted, the return value of the function is undefined. Constructors and destructors, and functions of type **void**,cannot specify an expression in the **return** statement. Functions of all other types must specify an expression in the **return** statement.  
  
 When the flow of control exits the block enclosing the function definition, the result is the same as it would be if a **return** statement without an expression had been executed. This is invalid for functions that are declared as returning a value.  
  
 A function can have any number of **return** statements.  
  
 The following example uses an expression with a **return** statement to obtain the largest of two integers.  
  
## Example  
  
```cpp 
// return_statement2.cpp  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int max ( int a, int b )  
{  
   return ( a > b ? a : b );  
}  
  
int main()  
{  
    int nOne = 5;  
    int nTwo = 7;  
  
    printf_s("\n%d is bigger\n", max( nOne, nTwo ));  
}  
```
