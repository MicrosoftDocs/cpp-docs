# main: Program Startup
A special function named **main** is the starting point of execution for all C and C++ programs. If you are writing code that adheres to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_unicode](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/includes/tlasharptla_unicode_md.md)] programming model, you can use `wmain`, which is the wide-character version of **main**.  
  
 The **main** function is not predefined by the compiler. It must be supplied in the program text.  
  
 The declaration syntax for **main** is  
  
```cpp 
int main();  
```  
  
 or, optionally,  
  
```cpp 
int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[]);  
```  
  
## Microsoft Specific  
 The declaration syntax for `wmain` is as follows:  
  
```cpp 
int wmain( );  
```  
  
 or, optionally,  
  
```cpp 
int wmain(int argc, wchar_t *argv[], wchar_t *envp[]);  
```  
  
 You can also use `_tmain`, which is defined in TCHAR.h. `_tmain` resolves to **main** unless _UNICODE is defined. In that case, `_tmain` resolves to `wmain`.  
  
 Alternatively, the **main** and `wmain` functions can be declared as returning **void** (no return value). If you declare **main** or `wmain` as returning **void**, you cannot return an exit code to the parent process or operating system by using a [return](../cpp/return-statement-in-program-termination-cpp.md) statement. To return an exit code when **main** or `wmain` is declared as **void**, you must use the [exit](../cpp/exit-function.md) function.  
  
**END Microsoft Specific**  
 The types for `argc` and `argv` are defined by the language. The names `argc`, `argv`, and `envp` are traditional, but are not required by the compiler. For more information and an example, see [Argument Definitions](../cpp/argument-definitions.md).
