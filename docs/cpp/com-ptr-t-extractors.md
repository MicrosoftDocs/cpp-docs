# `_com_ptr_t` Extractors

**Microsoft-specific**

Extract the encapsulated COM interface pointer.

## Syntax

```cpp
operator Interface*( ) const throw( );
operator Interface&( ) const;
Interface& operator*( ) const;
Interface* operator->( ) const;
Interface** operator&( ) throw( );
operator bool( ) const throw( );
```

## Remarks

- **`operator Interface*`** Returns the encapsulated interface pointer, which may be NULL.

- **`operator Interface&`** Returns a reference to the encapsulated interface pointer, and issues an error if the pointer is NULL.

- **`operator*`** Allows a smart pointer object to act as though it were the actual encapsulated interface when dereferenced.

- **`operator->`** Allows a smart pointer object to act as though it were the actual encapsulated interface when dereferenced.

- **`operator&`** Releases any encapsulated interface pointer, replacing it with NULL, and returns the address of the encapsulated pointer. This operator allows you to pass the smart pointer by address to a function that has an *out* parameter through which it returns an interface pointer.

- **`operator bool`** Allows a smart pointer object to be used in a conditional expression. This operator returns **`true`** if the pointer isn't NULL.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Because **`operator bool`** is not declared as **`explicit`**, `_com_ptr_t` is implicitly convertible to **`bool`**, which is convertible to any scalar type. This can have unexpected consequences in your code. Enable [Compiler Warning (level 4) C4800](../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4800.md) to prevent unintentional use of this conversion.
