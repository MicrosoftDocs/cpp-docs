# Range-based for Statement (C++)
Executes `statement` repeatedly and sequentially for each element in `expression`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
for ( for-range-declaration : expression )  
   statement   
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Use the range-based **for** statement to construct loops that must execute through a "range", which is defined as anything that you can iterate through—for example, `std::vector`, or any other C++ Standard Library sequence whose range is defined by a `begin()` and `end()`. The name that is declared in the `for-range-declaration` portion is local to the **for** statement and cannot be re-declared in `expression` or `statement`. Note that the [auto](../cpp/auto-cpp.md) keyword is preferred in the `for-range-declaration` portion of the statement. 

 **New in Visual Studio 2017:**  Range-based for loops no longer require that begin() and end() return objects of the same type. This enables end() to return a sentinel object such as used by ranges as defined in the Ranges-V3 proposal. For more information, see [Generalizing the Range-Based For Loop](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0184r0.html) and the [range-v3 library on GitHub](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3).
  
 This code shows how to use range-based **for** loops to iterate through an array and a vector:  
  
```cpp  
// range-based-for.cpp  
// compile by using: cl /EHsc /nologo /W4  
#include <iostream>  
#include <vector>  
using namespace std;  
  
int main()   
{  
    // Basic 10-element integer array.  
    int x[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };  
  
    // Range-based for loop to iterate through the array.  
    for( int y : x ) { // Access by value using a copy declared as a specific type.   
                       // Not preferred.  
        cout << y << " ";  
    }  
    cout << endl;  
  
    // The auto keyword causes type inference to be used. Preferred.  
  
    for( auto y : x ) { // Copy of 'x', almost always undesirable  
        cout << y << " ";  
    }  
    cout << endl;  
  
    for( auto &y : x ) { // Type inference by reference.  
        // Observes and/or modifies in-place. Preferred when modify is needed.  
        cout << y << " ";  
    }  
    cout << endl;  
  
    for( const auto &y : x ) { // Type inference by const reference.  
        // Observes in-place. Preferred when no modify is needed.  
        cout << y << " ";  
    }  
    cout << endl;  
    cout << "end of integer array test" << endl;  
    cout << endl;  
  
    // Create a vector object that contains 10 elements.  
    vector<double> v;  
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {  
        v.push_back(i + 0.14159);  
    }  
  
    // Range-based for loop to iterate through the vector, observing in-place.  
    for( const auto &j : v ) {  
        cout << j << " ";  
    }  
    cout << endl;  
    cout << "end of vector test" << endl;  
}  
```  
  
 Here is the output:  

```Output
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
  
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
  
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
  
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
  
 `end of integer array test`  
  
 `0.14159 1.14159 2.14159 3.14159 4.14159 5.14159 6.14159 7.14159 8.14159 9.14159`  
  
 `end of vector test`  
```

 A range-based **for** loop terminates when one of these in `statement` is executed: a [break](../cpp/break-statement-cpp.md), [return](../cpp/return-statement-cpp.md), or [goto](../cpp/goto-statement-cpp.md) to a labeled statement outside the range-based **for** loop. A [continue](../cpp/continue-statement-cpp.md) statement in a range-based **for** loop terminates only the current iteration.  
  
 Keep in mind these facts about range-based **for**:  
  
-   Automatically recognizes arrays.  
  
-   Recognizes containers that have `.begin()` and `.end()`.  
  
-   Uses argument-dependent lookup `begin()` and `end()` for anything else.
