# __unaligned

**Microsoft specific**. When you declare a pointer with the **__unaligned** modifier, the compiler assumes that the pointer addresses data that is not aligned. Consequently, platform-appropriate code is generated to handle unaligned reads and writes through the pointer.

## Remarks

This modifier describes the alignment of the data addressed by the pointer; the pointer itself is assumed to be aligned.

The necessity for the **__unaligned** keyword varies by platform and environment. Failure to mark data appropriately can result in issues ranging from performance penalties to hardware faults. The **__unaligned** modifier is not valid for the x86 platform.

For more information about alignment, see:
