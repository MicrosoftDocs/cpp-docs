# Microsoft-Specific Modifiers
This section describes Microsoft-specific extensions to C++ in the following areas:  
  
-   [Based addressing](../cpp/based-addressing.md), the practice of using a pointer as a base from which other pointers can be offset  
  
-   [Function calling conventions](../cpp/calling-conventions.md)  
  
-   Extended storage-class attributes declared with the [__declspec](../cpp/declspec.md) keyword  
  
-   The [__w64](../cpp/w64.md) keyword
