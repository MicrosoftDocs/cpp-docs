# Microsoft-Specific Modifiers
This section describes Microsoft-specific extensions to C++ in the following areas:  
  
-   [Based addressing](based-addressing.md), the practice of using a pointer as a base from which other pointers can be offset  
  
-   [Function calling conventions](calling-conventions.md)  
  
-   Extended storage-class attributes declared with the [__declspec](declspec.md) keyword  
  
-   The [__w64](w64.md) keyword  

### Microsoft-Specific Keywords  

Many of the Microsoft-specific keywords can be used to modify declarators to form derived types. For more information about declarators, see [Declarators](overview-of-declarators.md).  

|Keyword|Meaning|Used to Form Derived Types?|  	
|-------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
|[__based](based-grammar.md)|The name that follows declares a 32-bit offset to the 32-bit base contained in the declaration.|Yes|  	
|[__cdecl](cdecl.md)|The name that follows uses the C naming and calling conventions.|Yes|  	
|[__declspec](declspec.md)|The name that follows specifies a Microsoft-specific storage-class attribute.|No|  	
|[__fastcall](fastcall.md)|The name that follows declares a function that uses registers, when available, instead of the stack for argument passing.|Yes|  	
|[__restrict](extension-restrict.md)|Similar to __declspec([restrict](restrict.md)), but for use on variables.|No|  	
|[__stdcall](stdcall.md)|The name that follows specifies a function that observes the standard calling convention.|Yes|  	
|[__w64](w64.md)|Marks a data type as being larger on a 64-bit compiler.|No|  	
|[__unaligned](unaligned.md)|Specifies that a pointer to a type or other data is not aligned..|No|  	
|[__vectorcall](vectorcall.md)|The name that follows declares a function that uses registers, including SSE registers, when available, instead of the stack for argument passing.|Yes|
