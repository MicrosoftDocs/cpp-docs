# for Statement (C++)
Executes a statement repeatedly until the condition becomes false. For information on the range-based for statement, see [Range-based for Statement (C++)](../cpp/range-based-for-statement-cpp.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
for ( init-expression ; cond-expression ; loop-expression )   
    statement;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Use the **for** statement to construct loops that must execute a specified number of times.  
  
 The **for** statement consists of three optional parts, as shown in the following table.  
  
### for Loop Elements  
  
|Syntax Name|When Executed|Description|  
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|  
|`init-expression`|Before any other element of the **for** statement, `init-expression` is executed only once. Control then passes to `cond-expression`.|Often used to initialize loop indices. It can contain expressions or declarations.|  
|`cond-expression`|Before execution of each iteration of `statement`, including the first iteration. `statement` is executed only if `cond-expression` evaluates to true (nonzero).|An expression that evaluates to an integral type or a class type that has an unambiguous conversion to an integral type. Normally used to test for loop-termination criteria.|  
|`loop-expression`|At the end of each iteration of `statement`. After `loop-expression` is executed, `cond-expression` is evaluated.|Normally used to increment loop indices.|  
  
 The following examples show different ways to use the **for** statement.  
  
```cpp  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
  
int main() {  
    // The counter variable can be declared in the init-expression.  
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++ ){   
       cout << i;  
    }  
    // Output: 01  
    // The counter variable can be declared outside the for loop.  
    int i;  
    for (i = 0; i < 2; i++){  
        cout << i;  
    }  
    // Output: 01  
    // These for loops are the equivalent of a while loop.  
    i = 0;  
    while (i < 2){  
        cout << i++;  
    }  
}  
    // Output: 012  
```  
  
 `init-expression` and `loop-expression` can contain multiple statements separated by commas. For example:  
  
```cpp  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
  
int main(){  
    int i, j;  
    for ( i = 5, j = 10 ; i + j < 20; i++, j++ ) {  
        cout << "i + j = " << (i + j) << '\n';  
    }  
}  
    // Output:  
    i + j = 15  
    i + j = 17  
    i + j = 19  
```  
  
 `loop-expression` can be incremented or decremented, or modified in other ways.  
  
```cpp  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
  
int main(){  
for (int i = 10; i > 0; i--) {  
        cout << i << ' ';  
    }  
    // Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1  
    for (int i = 10; i < 20; i = i+2) {  
        cout << i << ' ';  
    }  
    // Output: 10 12 14 16 18  
```  
  
 A **for** loop terminates when a [break](../cpp/break-statement-cpp.md), [return](../cpp/return-statement-cpp.md), or [goto](../cpp/goto-statement-cpp.md) (to a labeled statement outside the **for** loop) within `statement` is executed. A [continue](../cpp/continue-statement-cpp.md) statement in a **for** loop terminates only the current iteration.  
  
 If `cond-expression` is omitted, it is considered true and the **for** loop will not terminate without a **break**, **return**, or **goto** within `statement`.  
  
 Although the three fields of the **for** statement are normally used for initialization, testing for termination, and incrementing, they are not restricted to these uses. For example, the following code prints the numbers 0 through 4. In this case, `statement` is the null statement:  
  
```cpp  
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
  
int main()  
{  
    int i;  
    for( i = 0; i < 5; cout << i << '\n', i++){  
        ;  
    }  
}  
```  
  
## for Loops and the C++ Standard  
 The C++ standard says that a variable declared in a **for** loop shall go out of scope after the **for** loop ends. For example:  
  
```cpp  
for (int i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i++) {  
   // do something  
}  
// i is now out of scope under /Za or /Zc:forScope  
```  
  
 By default, under [/Ze](../build/reference/za-ze-disable-language-extensions.md), a variable declared in a **for** loop remains in scope until the **for** loop's enclosing scope ends.  
  
 [/Zc:forScope](../build/reference/zc-forscope-force-conformance-in-for-loop-scope.md) enables standard behavior of variables declared in for loops without needing to specify `/Za`.  
  
 It is also possible to use the scoping differences of the **for** loop to redeclare variables under `/Ze` as follows:  
  
```cpp  
// for_statement5.cpp  
int main(){  
   int i = 0;   // hidden by var with same name declared in for loop  
   for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3; i++ ) {}  
  
   for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3; i++ ) {}  
}  
```  
  
 This more closely mimics the standard behavior of a variable declared in a **for** loop, which requires variables declared in a **for** loop to go out of scope after the loop is done. When a variable is declared in a **for** loop, the compiler internally promotes it to a local variable in the **for** loop's enclosing scope even if there is already a local variable with the same name.
