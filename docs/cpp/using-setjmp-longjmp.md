# Using setjmp and longjmp

When [setjmp](../c-runtime-library/reference/setjmp.md) and [longjmp](../c-runtime-library/reference/longjmp.md) are used together, they provide a way to execute a non-local **goto**. They are typically used in C code to pass execution control to error-handling or recovery code in a previously called routine without using the standard calling or return conventions.

> [!CAUTION]
> Because `setjmp` and `longjmp` don't support correct destruction of stack frame objects portably between C++ compilers, and because they might degrade performance by preventing optimization on local variables, we don't recommend their use in C++ programs. We recommend you use **try** and **catch** constructs instead.

If you decide to use `setjmp` and `longjmp` in a C++ program, also include \<setjmp.h> or \<setjmpex.h> to assure correct interaction between the functions and Structured Exception Handling (SEH) or C++ exception handling.

**Microsoft Specific**

If you use an [/EH](../build/reference/eh-exception-handling-model.md) option to compile C++ code, destructors for local objects are called during the stack unwind. However, if you use **/EHs** or **/EHsc** to compile, and one of your functions that uses [noexcept](../cpp/noexcept-cpp.md) calls `longjmp`, then the destructor unwind for that function might not occur, depending on the optimizer state.

In portable code, when a `longjmp` call is executed, correct destruction of frame-based objects is explicitly not guaranteed by the standard, and may not be supported by other compilers. To let you know, at warning level 4, a call to `setjmp` causes warning C4611: interaction between '_setjmp' and C++ object destruction is non-portable.
