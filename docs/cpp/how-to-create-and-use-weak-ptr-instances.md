# How to: Create and Use weak_ptr Instances
Sometimes an object must store a way to access the underlying object of a `shared_ptr` without causing the reference count to be incremented. Typically, this situation occurs when you have cyclic references between `shared_ptr` instances.  
  
 The best design is to avoid shared ownership of pointers whenever you can. However, if you must have shared ownership of `shared_ptr` instances, avoid cyclic references between them. When cyclic references are unavoidable, or even preferable for some reason, use `weak_ptr` to give one or more of the owners a weak reference to another `shared_ptr`. By using a `weak_ptr`, you can create a `shared_ptr` that joins to an existing set of related instances, but only if the underlying memory resource is still valid. A `weak_ptr` itself does not participate in the reference counting, and therefore, it cannot prevent the reference count from going to zero. However, you can use a `weak_ptr` to try to obtain a new copy of the `shared_ptr` with which it was initialized. If the memory has already been deleted, a `bad_weak_ptr` exception is thrown. If the memory is still valid, the new shared pointer increments the reference count and guarantees that the memory will be valid as long as the `shared_ptr` variable stays in scope.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example shows a case where `weak_ptr` is used to ensure proper deletion of objects that have circular dependencies. As you examine the example, assume that it was created only after alternative solutions were considered. The `Controller` objects represent some aspect of a machine process, and they operate independently. Each controller must be able to query the status of the other controllers at any time, and each one contains a private `vector<weak_ptr<Controller>>` for this purpose. Each vector contains a circular reference, and therefore, `weak_ptr` instances are used instead of `shared_ptr`.

```  
  
 As an experiment, modify the vector `others` to be a `vector<shared_ptr<Controller>>`, and then in the output, notice that no destructors are invoked when `TestRun` returns.
