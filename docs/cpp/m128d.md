# __m128d

**Microsoft Specific**

The **`__m128d`** data type, for use with the Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 instructions intrinsics, is defined in \<emmintrin.h>.

```cpp
// data_types__m128d.cpp
#include <emmintrin.h>
int main() {
   __m128d x;
}
```

## Remarks

You should not access the **`__m128d`** fields directly. You can, however, see these types in the debugger. A variable of type **`__m128`** maps to the XMM[0-7] registers.

Variables of type **_m128d** are automatically aligned on 16-byte boundaries.

The **`__m128d`** data type is not supported on ARM processors.
