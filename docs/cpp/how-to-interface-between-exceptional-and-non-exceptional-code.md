# How to: Interface between exceptional and non-exceptional code

This article describes how to implement consistent exception-handling in C++ code, and how to translate exceptions to and from error codes at exception boundaries.

Sometimes C++ code has to interface with code that doesn't use exceptions (non-exceptional code). Such an interface is known as an *exception boundary*. For example, you may want to call the Win32 function `CreateFile` in your C++ program. `CreateFile` doesn't throw exceptions. Instead, it sets error codes that can be retrieved by the `GetLastError` function. If your C++ program is non-trivial, then you probably prefer to have a consistent exception-based error-handling policy. And, you probably don't want to abandon exceptions just because you interface with non-exceptional code. You also don't want to mix exception-based and non-exception-based error policies in your C++ code.

## <a name="calling-non-exceptional-functions-from-c"></a> Call non-exceptional functions from C++

When you call a non-exceptional function from C++, the idea is to wrap that function in a C++ function that detects any errors and then possibly throws an exception. When you design such a wrapper function, first decide which type of exception guarantee to provide: noexcept, strong, or basic. Second, design the function so that all resources, for example, file handles, are correctly released if an exception is thrown. Typically, it means that you use smart pointers or similar resource managers to own the resources. For more information about design considerations, see [How to: Design for exception safety](how-to-design-for-exception-safety.md).

### Example

The following example shows C++ functions that use the Win32 `CreateFile` and `ReadFile` functions internally to open and read two files.  The `File` class is a resource acquisition is initialization (RAII) wrapper for the file handles. Its constructor detects a "file not found" condition and throws an exception to propagate the error up the call stack of the C++ executable (in this example, the `main()` function). If an exception is thrown after a `File` object is fully constructed, the destructor automatically calls `CloseHandle` to release the file handle. (If you prefer, you can use the Active Template Library (ATL) `CHandle` class for this same purpose, or a `unique_ptr` together with a custom deletion function.) The functions that call Win32 and CRT APIs detect errors and then throw C++ exceptions using the locally defined `ThrowLastErrorIf` function, which in turn uses the `Win32Exception` class, derived from the `runtime_error` class. All functions in this example provide a strong exception guarantee: If an exception is thrown at any point in these functions, no resources are leaked and no program state is modified.

## <a name="calling-exceptional-code-from-non-exceptional-code"></a> Call exceptional code from non-exceptional code

C++ functions that are declared as `extern "C"` can be called by C programs. C++ COM servers can be consumed by code written in any number of different languages. When you implement public exception-aware functions in C++ to be called by non-exceptional code, the C++ function must not allow any exceptions to propagate back to the caller. Such callers have no way to catch or handle C++ exceptions. The program may terminate, leak resources, or cause undefined behavior.

We recommend your `extern "C"` C++ function specifically catch every exception that it knows how to handle and, if appropriate, convert the exception to an error code that the caller understands. If not all potential exceptions are known, the C++ function should have a `catch(...)` block as the last handler. In such a case, it's best to report a fatal error to the caller, because your program might be in an unknown and unrecoverable state.

The following example shows a function that assumes that any exception that might be thrown is either a `Win32Exception` or an exception type derived from `std::exception`. The function catches any exception of these types and propagates the error information as a Win32 error code to the caller.

```cpp
BOOL DiffFiles2(const string& file1, const string& file2)
{
    try
    {
        File f1(file1);
        File f2(file2);
        if (IsTextFileDiff(f1, f2))
        {
            SetLastError(MY_APPLICATION_ERROR_FILE_MISMATCH);
            return FALSE;
        }
        return TRUE;
    }
    catch(Win32Exception& e)
    {
        SetLastError(e.GetErrorCode());
    }

    catch(std::exception& e)
    {
        SetLastError(MY_APPLICATION_GENERAL_ERROR);
    }
    return FALSE;
}
```

When you convert from exceptions to error codes, there's a potential issue: Error codes often don't contain the richness of information that an exception can store. To address this issue, you can provide a **`catch`** block for each specific exception type that might be thrown, and perform logging to record the details of the exception before it's converted to an error code. This approach can create repetitive code if multiple functions all use the same set of **`catch`** blocks. A good way to avoid code repetition is by refactoring those blocks into one private utility function that implements the **`try`** and **`catch`** blocks and accepts a function object that is invoked in the **`try`** block. In each public function, pass the code to the utility function as a lambda expression.

```cpp
template<typename Func>
bool Win32ExceptionBoundary(Func&& f)
{
    try
    {
        return f();
    }
    catch(Win32Exception& e)
    {
        SetLastError(e.GetErrorCode());
    }
    catch(const std::exception& e)
    {
        SetLastError(MY_APPLICATION_GENERAL_ERROR);
    }
    return false;
}
```

The following example shows how to write the lambda expression that defines the functor. A lambda expression is often easier to read inline than code that calls a named function object.

```cpp
bool DiffFiles3(const string& file1, const string& file2)
{
    return Win32ExceptionBoundary([&]() -> bool
    {
        File f1(file1);
        File f2(file2);
        if (IsTextFileDiff(f1, f2))
        {
            SetLastError(MY_APPLICATION_ERROR_FILE_MISMATCH);
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    });
}
```

## Call exceptional code through non-exceptional code from exceptional code

It's possible, but not recommended, to throw exceptions across exception-unaware code. For example, your C++ program may call a library that uses callback functions you provide. In some circumstances, you can throw exceptions from the callback functions across the non-exceptional code that your original caller can handle. However, the circumstances when exceptions can work successfully are strict. You must compile the library code in a way that preserves stack unwinding semantics. The exception-unaware code can't do anything that might trap the C++ exception. Also, the library code between the caller and the callback can't allocate local resources. For example, the code that isn't exception-aware can't have locals that point to allocated heap memory. These resources are leaked when the stack is unwound.

These requirements must be met to throw exceptions across non-exception-aware code:

- You can build the entire code path across the non-exception-aware code using **`/EHs`**,
- There aren't any locally allocated resources that can leak when the stack is unwound,
- The code doesn't have any `__except` structured exception handlers that catch all exceptions.

Because throwing exceptions across non-exceptional code is error-prone and may cause difficult debugging challenges, we don't recommend it.
