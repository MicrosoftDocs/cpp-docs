# __super
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Allows you to explicitly state that you are calling a base-class implementation for a function that you are overriding.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
__super::member_function();  
  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 All accessible base-class methods are considered during the overload resolution phase, and the function that provides the best match is the one that is called.  
  
 **__super** can only appear within the body of a member function.  
  
 **__super** cannot be used with a using declaration. See [using Declaration](../cpp/using-declaration.md) for more information.  
  
 With the introduction of [attributes](../windows/cpp-attributes-reference.md) that inject code, your code might contain one or more base classes whose names you may not know but that contain methods that you wish to call.  
  
## Example  
  
```cpp 
// deriv_super.cpp  
// compile with: /c  
struct B1 {  
   void mf(int) {}  
};  
  
struct B2 {  
   void mf(short) {}  
  
   void mf(char) {}  
};  
  
struct D : B1, B2 {  
   void mf(short) {  
      __super::mf(1);   // Calls B1::mf(int)  
      __super::mf('s');   // Calls B2::mf(char)  
   }  
};  
```
