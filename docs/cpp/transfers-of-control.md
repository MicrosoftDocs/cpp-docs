# Transfers of Control
You can use the **goto** statement or a **case** label in a **switch** statement to specify a program that branches past an initializer. Such code is illegal unless the declaration that contains the initializer is in a block enclosed by the block in which the jump statement occurs.  
  
 The following example shows a loop that declares and initializes the objects `total`, `ch`, and `i`. There is also an erroneous **goto** statement that transfers control past an initializer.  
  
```cpp 
// transfers_of_control.cpp  
// compile with: /W1  
// Read input until a nonnumeric character is entered.  
int main()  
{  
   char MyArray[5] = {'2','2','a','c'};  
   int i = 0;  
   while( 1 )  
   {  
      int total = 0;  
  
      char ch = MyArray[i++];  
  
      if ( ch >= '0' && ch <= '9' )  
      {  
         goto Label1;  
  
         int i = ch - '0';  
      Label1:  
         total += i;   // C4700: transfers past initialization of i.  
      } // i would be destroyed here if  goto error were not present  
   else  
      // Break statement transfers control out of loop,  
      //  destroying total and ch.  
      break;  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 In the preceding example, the **goto** statement tries to transfer control past the initialization of `i`. However, if `i` were declared but not initialized, the transfer would be legal.  
  
 The objects `total` and `ch`, declared in the block that serves as the *statement* of the **while** statement, are destroyed when that block is exited using the **break** statement.
