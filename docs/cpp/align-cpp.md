# `align` (C++)

In Visual Studio 2015 and later, use [**`alignas`** specifier](../cpp/alignas-specifier.md) (C++11) to control alignment. For more information, see [Alignment](../cpp/alignment-cpp-declarations.md).

**Microsoft Specific**

Use `__declspec(align(#))` to precisely control the alignment of user-defined data (for example, static allocations or automatic data in a function).

## Syntax

> **__declspec( align(** *#* **) )** *declarator*

## Remarks

Writing applications that use the latest processor instructions introduces some new constraints and issues. Many new instructions require data be aligned to 16-byte boundaries. Aligning frequently used data to the processor's cache line size improves cache performance. For example, if you define a structure whose size is less than 32 bytes, you might want 32-byte alignment to make sure that objects of that structure type are efficiently cached.

\# is the alignment value. Valid entries are integer powers of two from 1 to 8192 (bytes), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64. `declarator` is the data that you're declaring as aligned.

For information about how to return a value of type `size_t` that is the alignment requirement of the type, see [`alignof`](../cpp/alignof-operator.md). For information about how to declare unaligned pointers when targeting 64-bit processors, see [`__unaligned`](../cpp/unaligned.md).

You can use `__declspec(align(#))` when you define a **`struct`**, **`union`**, or **`class`**, or when you declare a variable.

The compiler doesn't guarantee, or attempt to preserve, the alignment attribute of data during a copy or data transform operation. For example, [`memcpy`](../c-runtime-library/reference/memcpy-wmemcpy.md) can copy a struct declared with `__declspec(align(#))` to any location. Ordinary allocators (for example, [`malloc`](../c-runtime-library/reference/malloc.md), C++ [`operator new`](new-operator-cpp.md), and the Win32 allocators) typically return memory that isn't aligned for `__declspec(align(#))` structures or arrays of structures. To guarantee that the destination of a copy or data transformation operation is correctly aligned, use [`_aligned_malloc`](../c-runtime-library/reference/aligned-malloc.md). Or, write your own allocator.

You can't specify alignment for function parameters. When you pass data that has an alignment attribute by value on the stack, the calling convention controls its alignment. If data alignment is important in the called function, copy the parameter into correctly aligned memory before use.

Without `__declspec(align(#))`, the compiler generally aligns data on natural boundaries based on the target processor and the size of the data, up to 4-byte boundaries on 32-bit processors, and 8-byte boundaries on 64-bit processors. Data in classes or structures is aligned in the class or structure at the minimum of its natural alignment and the current packing setting (from `#pragma pack` or the `/Zp` compiler option).

This example demonstrates the use of `__declspec(align(#))`:

```cpp
__declspec(align(32)) struct Str1{
   int a, b, c, d, e;
};
```

This type now has a 32-byte alignment attribute. It means that all static and automatic instances start on a 32-byte boundary. Other structure types declared with this type as a member preserve this type's alignment attribute. That is, any structure with `Str1` as an element has an alignment attribute of at least 32.

Here, `sizeof(struct Str1)` is equal to 32. It implies that if an array of `Str1` objects is created, and the base of the array is 32-byte aligned, each member of the array is also 32-byte aligned. To create an array whose base is correctly aligned in dynamic memory, use [`_aligned_malloc`](../c-runtime-library/reference/aligned-malloc.md). Or, write your own allocator.

The **`sizeof`** value for any structure is the offset of the final member, plus that member's size, rounded up to the nearest multiple of the largest member alignment value or the whole structure alignment value, whichever is larger.

The compiler uses these rules for structure alignment:

- Unless overridden with `__declspec(align(#))`, the alignment of a scalar structure member is the minimum of its size and the current packing.

- Unless overridden with `__declspec(align(#))`, the alignment of a structure is the maximum of the individual alignments of its member(s).

- A structure member is placed at an offset from the start of its parent structure that's the smallest multiple of its alignment greater than or equal to the offset of the end of the previous member.

- The size of a structure is the smallest multiple of its alignment greater than or equal to the offset of the end of its last member.

`__declspec(align(#))` can only increase alignment restrictions.

## <a name="vclrfalignexamples"></a> `align` Examples

The following examples show how `__declspec(align(#))` affects the size and alignment of data structures. The examples assume the following definitions:

```cpp
#define CACHE_LINE  32
#define CACHE_ALIGN __declspec(align(CACHE_LINE))
```

In this example, the `S1` structure is defined by using `__declspec(align(32))`. All uses of `S1` for a variable definition or in other type declarations are 32-byte aligned. `sizeof(struct S1)` returns 32, and `S1` has 16 padding bytes following the 16 bytes required to hold the four integers. Each **`int`** member requires 4-byte alignment, but the alignment of the structure itself is declared to be 32. Then the overall alignment is 32.

```cpp
struct CACHE_ALIGN S1 { // cache align all instances of S1
   int a, b, c, d;
};
struct S1 s1;   // s1 is 32-byte cache aligned
```

In this example, `sizeof(struct S2)` returns 16, which is exactly the sum of the member sizes, because that is a multiple of the largest alignment requirement (a multiple of 8).

```cpp
__declspec(align(8)) struct S2 {
   int a, b, c, d;
};
```

In the following example, `sizeof(struct S3)` returns 64.

```cpp
struct S3 {
   struct S1 s1;   // S3 inherits cache alignment requirement
                  // from S1 declaration
   int a;         // a is now cache aligned because of s1
                  // 28 bytes of trailing padding
};
```

In this example, notice that `a` has the alignment of its natural type, in this case, 4 bytes. However, `S1` must be 32-byte aligned. 28 bytes of padding follow `a`, so that `s1` starts at offset 32. `S4` then inherits the alignment requirement of `S1`, because it's the largest alignment requirement in the structure. `sizeof(struct S4)` returns 64.

```cpp
struct S4 {
   int a;
   // 28 bytes padding
   struct S1 s1;      // S4 inherits cache alignment requirement of S1
};
```

The following three variable declarations also use `__declspec(align(#))`. In each case, the variable must be 32-byte aligned. In the array, the base address of the array, not each array member, is 32-byte aligned. The **`sizeof`** value for each array member is unaffected when you use `__declspec(align(#))`.

```cpp
CACHE_ALIGN int i;
CACHE_ALIGN int array[128];
CACHE_ALIGN struct s2 s;
```

To align each member of an array, code such as this should be used:

```cpp
typedef CACHE_ALIGN struct { int a; } S5;
S5 array[10];
```

In this example, notice that aligning the structure itself and aligning the first element have the same effect:

```cpp
CACHE_ALIGN struct S6 {
   int a;
   int b;
};

struct S7 {
   CACHE_ALIGN int a;
               int b;
};
```

`S6` and `S7` have identical alignment, allocation, and size characteristics.

In this example, the alignment of the starting addresses of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are 4, 1, 4, and 1, respectively.

```cpp
void fn() {
   int a;
   char b;
   long c;
   char d[10]
}
```

The alignment when memory is allocated on the heap depends on which allocation function is called.  For example, if you use `malloc`, the result depends on the operand size. If *arg* >= 8, the memory returned is 8-byte aligned. If *arg* < 8, the alignment of the memory returned is the first power of 2 less than *arg*. For example, if you use `malloc(7)`, the alignment is 4 bytes.

## <a name="vclrf_declspecaligntypedef"></a> Defining new types with `__declspec(align(#))`

You can define a type with an alignment characteristic.

For example, you can define a **`struct`** with an alignment value this way:

```cpp
struct aType {int a; int b;};
typedef __declspec(align(32)) struct aType bType;
```

Now, `aType` and `bType` are the same size (8 bytes) but variables of type `bType` are 32-byte aligned.

## <a name="vclrfthreadlocalstorageallocation"></a> Aligning data in thread local storage

Static thread-local storage (TLS) created with the `__declspec(thread)` attribute and put in the TLS section in the image works for alignment exactly like normal static data. To create TLS data, the operating system allocates memory the size of the TLS section and respects the TLS section alignment attribute.

This example shows various ways to place aligned data into thread local storage.

```cpp
// put an aligned integer in TLS
__declspec(thread) __declspec(align(32)) int a;

// define an aligned structure and put a variable of the struct type
// into TLS
__declspec(thread) __declspec(align(32)) struct F1 { int a; int b; } a;

// create an aligned structure
struct CACHE_ALIGN S9 {
   int a;
   int b;
};
// put a variable of the structure type into TLS
__declspec(thread) struct S9 a;
```

## <a name="vclrfhowalignworkswithdatapacking"></a> How `align` works with data packing

The `/Zp` compiler option and the `pack` pragma have the effect of packing data for structure and union members. This example shows how `/Zp` and `__declspec(align(#))` work together:

```cpp
struct S {
   char a;
   short b;
   double c;
   CACHE_ALIGN double d;
   char e;
   double f;
};
```

The following table lists the offset of each member under different `/Zp` (or `#pragma pack`) values, showing how the two interact.

|Variable|/Zp1|/Zp2|/Zp4|/Zp8|
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|a|0|0|0|0|
|b|1|2|2|2|
|c|3|4|4|8|
|d|32|32|32|32|
|e|40|40|40|40|
|f|41|42|44|48|
|sizeof(S)|64|64|64|64|

For more information, see [`/Zp` (Struct Member Alignment)](../build/reference/zp-struct-member-alignment.md).

The offset of an object is based on the offset of the previous object and the current packing setting, unless the object has a `__declspec(align(#))` attribute, in which case the alignment is based on the offset of the previous object and the `__declspec(align(#))` value for the object.
