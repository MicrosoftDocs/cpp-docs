# do-while Statement (C++)
Executes a *statement* repeatedly until the specified termination condition (the *expression*) evaluates to zero.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
do  
   statement  
while ( expression ) ;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The test of the termination condition is made after each execution of the loop; therefore, a **do-while** loop executes one or more times, depending on the value of the termination expression. The **do-while** statement can also terminate when a [break](../cpp/break-statement-cpp.md), [goto](../cpp/goto-statement-cpp.md), or [return](../cpp/return-statement-cpp.md) statement is executed within the statement body.  
  
 The *expression* must have arithmetic or pointer type. Execution proceeds as follows:  
  
1.  The statement body is executed.  
  
2.  Next, *expression* is evaluated. If *expression* is false, the **do-while** statement terminates and control passes to the next statement in the program. If *expression* is true (nonzero), the process is repeated, beginning with step 1.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample demonstrates the **do-while** statement:  
  
```cpp 
// do_while_statement.cpp  
#include <stdio.h>  
int main()  
{  
    int i = 0;  
    do  
    {  
        printf_s("\n%d",i++);  
    } while (i < 3);  
}  
```
