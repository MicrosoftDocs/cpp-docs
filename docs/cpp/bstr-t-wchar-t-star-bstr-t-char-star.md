# _bstr_t::wchar_t*, _bstr_t::char*
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Returns the BSTR characters as a narrow or wide character array.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
operator const wchar_t*( ) const throw( );   
operator wchar_t*( ) const throw( );   
operator const char*( ) const;   
operator char*( ) const;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 These operators can be used to extract the character data that is encapsulated by the `BSTR` object. Assigning a new value to the returned pointer does not modify the original BSTR data.
