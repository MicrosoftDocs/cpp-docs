# goto Statement (C++)
The **goto** statement unconditionally transfers control to the statement labeled by the specified identifier.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
goto identifier;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The labeled statement designated by `identifier` must be in the current function. All `identifier` names are members of an internal namespace and therefore do not interfere with other identifiers.  
  
 A statement label is meaningful only to a **goto** statement; otherwise, statement labels are ignored. Labels cannot be redeclared.  
  
 It is good programming style to use the **break**, **continue**, and **return** statements instead of the **goto** statement whenever possible. However, because the **break** statement exits from only one level of a loop, you might have to use a **goto** statement to exit a deeply nested loop.  
  
 For more information about labels and the **goto** statement, see [Labeled Statements](../cpp/labeled-statements.md).  
  
## Example  
 In this example, a **goto** statement transfers control to the point labeled `stop` when `i` equals 3.  
  
```cpp  
// goto_statement.cpp  
#include <stdio.h>  
int main()  
{  
    int i, j;  
  
    for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )  
    {  
        printf_s( "Outer loop executing. i = %d\n", i );  
        for ( j = 0; j < 2; j++ )  
        {  
            printf_s( " Inner loop executing. j = %d\n", j );  
            if ( i == 3 )  
                goto stop;  
        }  
    }  
  
    // This message does not print:   
    printf_s( "Loop exited. i = %d\n", i );  
  
    stop:   
    printf_s( "Jumped to stop. i = %d\n", i );  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
Outer loop executing. i = 0  
 Inner loop executing. j = 0  
 Inner loop executing. j = 1  
Outer loop executing. i = 1  
 Inner loop executing. j = 0  
 Inner loop executing. j = 1  
Outer loop executing. i = 2  
 Inner loop executing. j = 0  
 Inner loop executing. j = 1  
Outer loop executing. i = 3  
 Inner loop executing. j = 0  
Jumped to stop. i = 3  
```
