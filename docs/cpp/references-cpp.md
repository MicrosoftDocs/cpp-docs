# References (C++)
A reference, like a pointer, stores the address of an object that is located elsewhere in memory. Unlike a pointer, a reference after it is initialized cannot be made to refer to a different object or set to null. There are two kinds of references: lvalue references which refer to a named variable and rvalue references which refer to a [temporary object](../cpp/temporary-objects.md). The & operator signifies an lvalue reference and the && operator signifies either an rvalue reference, or a universal reference (either rvalue or lvalue) depending on the context.  
  
 References may be declared using the following syntax:  
  
```  
[storage-class-specifiers] [cv-qualifiers] type-specifiers   
[ms-modifier] declarator [= expression];  
```  
  
 Any valid declarator specifying a reference may be used. Unless the reference is a reference to function or array type, the following simplified syntax applies:  
  
```  
[storage-class-specifiers] [cv-qualifiers] type-specifiers [& or &&]   
[cv-qualifiers] identifier [= expression];  
```  
  
 References are declared using the following sequence:  
  
 1. The declaration specifiers:  
  
-   An optional storage class specifier.  
  
-   Optional **const** and/or **volatile** qualifiers.  
  
-   The type specifier: the name of a type.  
  
-   2. The declarator:  
  
-   An optional Microsoft specific modifier. For more information, see [Microsoft-Specific Modifiers](../cpp/microsoft-specific-modifiers.md).  
  
-   The & operator or && operator.  
  
-   Optional **const** and/or **volatile** qualifers.  
  
-   The identifier.  
  
 3. An optional initializer.  
  
 The more complex declarator forms for pointers to arrays and functions also apply to references to arrays and functions, see [pointers](../cpp/pointers-cpp.md).  
  
 Multiple declarators and initializers may appear in a comma-separated list following a single declaration specifier. For example:  
  
```cpp 
int &i;   
int &i, &j;   
```  
  
 References, pointers and objects may be declared together:  
  
```cpp 
int &ref, *ptr, k;   
```  
  
 A reference holds the address of an object, but behaves syntactically like an object.  
  
 In the following program, notice that the name of the object, `Today`, and the reference to the object, `TodayRef`, can be used identically in programs:  
  
## Example  
  
```cpp 
// references.cpp  
#include <stdio.h>  
struct S {  
   short i;  
};  
  
int main() {  
   S  s;   // Declare the object.  
   S& SRef = s;   // Declare the reference.  
   s.i = 3;  
  
   printf_s("%d\n", s.i);  
   printf_s("%d\n", SRef.i);  
  
   SRef.i = 4;  
   printf_s("%d\n", s.i);  
   printf_s("%d\n", SRef.i);  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
3  
3  
4  
4  
```
