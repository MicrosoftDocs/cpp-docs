# __m64
## Microsoft Specific  
 The **__m64** data type is for use with the MMX and 3DNow! intrinsics, and is defined in \<xmmintrin.h>.  
  
```cpp 
// data_types__m64.cpp  
#include <xmmintrin.h>  
int main()  
{  
   __m64 x;  
}  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 You should not access the **__m64** fields directly. You can, however, see these types in the debugger. A variable of type **__m64** maps to the MM[0-7] registers.  
  
 Variables of type **_m64** are automatically aligned on 8-byte boundaries.  
  
 The **__m64** data type is not supported on [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../assembler/inline/includes/vcprx64_md.md)] processors. Applications that use __m64 as part of MMX intrinsics must be rewritten to use equivalent SSE and SSE2 intrinsics.
