# Fundamental Types  (C++)
Fundamental types in C++ are divided into three categories: integral, floating point, and void. Integral types are capable of handling whole numbers. Floating point types are capable of specifying values that may have fractional parts.  
  
 The [void](../cpp/void-cpp.md) type describes an empty set of values. No variable of type **void** can be specified — it is used primarily to declare functions that return no values or to declare generic pointers to untyped or arbitrarily typed data. Any expression can be explicitly converted or cast to type **void**. However, such expressions are restricted to the following uses:  
  
-   An expression statement. (See [Expressions](../cpp/expressions-cpp.md), for more information.)  
  
-   The left operand of the comma operator. (See [Comma Operator](../cpp/comma-operator.md) for more information.)  
  
-   The second or third operand of the conditional operator (`? :`). (See [Expressions with the Conditional Operator](../cpp/conditional-operator-q.md) for more information.)  
  
 The following table explains the restrictions on type sizes. These restrictions are independent of the Microsoft implementation.  
  
### Fundamental Types of the C++ Language  
  
|Category|Type|Contents|  
|--------------|----------|--------------|  
|Integral|**char**|Type **char** is an integral type that usually contains members of the basic execution character set — By default, this is ASCII in Microsoft C++.<br /><br /> The C++ compiler treats variables of type **char**, **signed char**, and **unsigned char** as having different types. Variables of type **char** are promoted to **int** as if they are type **signed char** by default, unless the /J compilation option is used. In this case they are treated as type **unsigned char** and are promoted to **int** without sign extension.|  
||**bool**|Type **bool** is an integral type that can have one of the two values **true** or **false**. Its size is unspecified.|  
||**short**|Type **short int** (or simply **short**) is an integral type that is larger than or equal to the size of type **char**, and shorter than or equal to the size of type **int**.<br /><br /> Objects of type **short** can be declared as **signed short** or **unsigned short**. **Signed short** is a synonym for **short**.|  
||**int**|Type **int** is an integral type that is larger than or equal to the size of type **short int**, and shorter than or equal to the size of type **long**.<br /><br /> Objects of type **int** can be declared as **signed int** or **unsigned int**. **Signed int** is a synonym for **int**.|  
||**__int8**, **__int16**, **__int32**, **__int64**|Sized integer `__int n`, where `n` is the size, in bits, of the integer variable. **__int8**, **__int16**, **__int32** and **__int64** are Microsoft-specific keywords. Not all types are available on all architectures. (**__int128** is not supported.)|  
||**long**|Type **long** (or **long int**) is an integral type that is larger than or equal to the size of type **int**.<br /><br /> Objects of type **long** can be declared as **signed long** or **unsigned long**. **Signed long** is a synonym for **long**.|  
||**long long**|Larger than an unsigned **long**.<br /><br /> Objects of type **long long** can be declared as **signed long long** or **unsigned long long**. **signed long long** is a synonym for **long long**.|  
||**wchar_t**, **__wchar_t**|A variable of type **wchar_t** designates a wide-character or multibyte character type. By default, **wchar_t** is a native type, but you can use [/Zc:wchar_t-](../build/reference/zc-wchar-t-wchar-t-is-native-type.md) to make **wchar_t** a typedef for **unsigned short**. The **__wchar_t** type is a Microsoft-specific synonym for the native **wchar_t** type.<br /><br /> Use the L prefix before a character or string literal to designate the wide-character type.|  
|Floating point|**float**|Type **float** is the smallest floating point type.|  
||**double**|Type **double** is a floating point type that is larger than or equal to type **float**, but shorter than or equal to the size of type **long double**.<br /><br /> Microsoft specific: The representation of **long double** and **double** is identical. However, **long double** and **double** are separate types.|  
||**long double**|Type **long double** is a floating point type that is larger than or equal to type **double**.|  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 The following table lists the amount of storage required for fundamental types in Microsoft C++.  
  
### Sizes of Fundamental Types  
  
|Type|Size|  
|----------|----------|  
|**bool**, **char**, **unsigned char**, **signed char**, **__int8**|1 byte|  
|**__int16**, **short**, **unsigned short**, **wchar_t**, **__wchar_t**|2 bytes|  
|**float**, **__int32**, **int**, **unsigned int**, **long**, **unsigned long**|4 bytes|  
|**double**, **__int64**, **long double**, **long long**|8 bytes|
