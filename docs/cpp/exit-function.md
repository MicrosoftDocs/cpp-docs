# exit Function
The `exit` function, declared in the standard include file \<stdlib.h>, terminates a C++ program.  
  
 The value supplied as an argument to `exit` is returned to the operating system as the program's return code or exit code. By convention, a return code of zero means that the program completed successfully.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can use the constants EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS, defined in \<stdlib.h>, to indicate success or failure of your program.  
  
 Issuing a **return** statement from the `main` function is equivalent to calling the `exit` function with the return value as its argument.  
  
 For more information, see [exit](../c-runtime-library/reference/exit-exit-exit.md) in the *Run-Time Library Reference*.
