# Program Termination
In C++, there are several ways to exit a program:  
  
-   Call the [exit](../cpp/exit-function.md) function.  
  
-   Call the [abort](../cpp/abort-function.md) function.  
  
-   Execute a [return](../cpp/return-statement-in-program-termination-cpp.md) statement from `main`.
