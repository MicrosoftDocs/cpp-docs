# Identifiers (C++)
An identifier is a sequence of characters used to denote one of the following:  
  
-   Object or variable name  
  
-   Class, structure, or union name  
  
-   Enumerated type name  
  
-   Member of a class, structure, union, or enumeration  
  
-   Function or class-member function  
  
-   typedef name  
  
-   Label name  
  
-   Macro name  
  
-   Macro parameter  
  
 The following characters are allowed as any character of an identifier:  
  
```  
_ a b c d e f g h i j k l m  
n o p q r s t u v w x y z  
A B C D E F G H I J K L M  
N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  
```  
  
 Certain ranges of universal character names are also allowed in an identifier.  A universal character name in an identifier cannot designate a control character or a character in the basic source character set. For more information, see [Character Sets](../cpp/character-sets.md). These Unicode code point number ranges are allowed as universal character names for any character in an identifier:  
  
-   00A8, 00AA, 00AD, 00AF, 00B2-00B5, 00B7-00BA, 00BC-00BE, 00C0-00D6, 00D8-00F6, 00F8-00FF, 0100-02FF, 0370-167F, 1681-180D, 180F-1DBF, 1E00-1FFF, 200B-200D, 202A-202E, 203F-2040, 2054, 2060-206F, 2070-20CF, 2100-218F, 2460-24FF, 2776-2793, 2C00-2DFF, 2E80-2FFF, 3004-3007, 3021-302F, 3031-303F, 3040-D7FF, F900-FD3D, FD40-FDCF, FDF0-FE1F, FE30-FE44, FE47-FFFD, 10000-1FFFD, 20000-2FFFD, 30000-3FFFD, 40000-4FFFD, 50000-5FFFD, 60000-6FFFD, 70000-7FFFD, 80000-8FFFD, 90000-9FFFD, A0000-AFFFD, B0000-BFFFD, C0000-CFFFD, D0000-DFFFD, E0000-EFFFD  
  
 The following characters are allowed as any character in an identifier except the first:  
  
```  
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
```  
  
 These  Unicode code point number ranges are also allowed as universal character names for any character in an identifier except the first:  
  
-   0300-036F, 1DC0-1DFF, 20D0-20FF, FE20-FE2F  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Only the first 2048 characters of Microsoft C++ identifiers are significant. Names for user-defined types are "decorated" by the compiler to preserve type information. The resultant name, including the type information, cannot be longer than 2048 characters. (See [Decorated Names](../build/reference/decorated-names.md) for more information.) Factors that can influence the length of a decorated identifier are:  
  
-   Whether the identifier denotes an object of user-defined type or a type derived from a user-defined type.  
  
-   Whether the identifier denotes a function or a type derived from a function.  
  
-   The number of arguments to a function.  
  
 The dollar sign `$` is a valid identifier character in Visual C++. Visual C++ also allows you to use the actual characters represented by the allowed ranges of universal character names in identifiers. To use these characters, you must save the file by using a file encoding codepage that includes them.  This example shows how both extended characters and universal character names can be used interchangeably in your code.  
  
```cpp  
// extended_identifier.cpp  
// In Visual Studio, use File, Advanced Save Options to set  
// the file encoding to Unicode codepage 1200  
struct テスト         // Japanese 'test'  
{  
    void トスト() {}  // Japanese 'toast'  
};  
  
int main() {  
    テスト \u30D1\u30F3;  // Japanese パン 'bread' in UCN form  
    パン.トスト();        // compiler recognizes UCN or literal form  
}  
```  
  
 The range of characters allowed in an identifier is less restrictive when compiling C++/CLI code. Identifiers in code compiled by using /clr should follow  [Standard ECMA-335: Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm).  
  
 **END Microsoft Specific**  
  
 The first character of an identifier must be an alphabetic character, either uppercase or lowercase, or an underscore ( **_** ). Because C++ identifiers are case sensitive, `fileName` is different from `FileName`.  
  
 Identifiers cannot be exactly the same spelling and case as keywords. Identifiers that contain keywords are legal. For example, `Pint` is a legal identifier, even though it contains **int**, which is a keyword.  
  
 Use of two sequential underscore characters ( **__** ) at the beginning of an identifier, or a single leading underscore followed by a capital letter, is reserved for C++ implementations in all scopes. You should avoid using one leading underscore followed by a lowercase letter for names with file scope because of possible conflicts with current or future reserved identifiers.
