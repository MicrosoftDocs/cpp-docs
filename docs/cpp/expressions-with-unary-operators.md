# Expressions with Unary Operators
Unary operators act on only one operand in an expression. The unary operators are as follows:  
  
-   [Indirection operator (*)](../cpp/indirection-operator-star.md)  
  
-   [Address-of operator (&)](../cpp/address-of-operator-amp.md)  
  
-   [Unary plus operator (+)](../cpp/unary-plus-and-negation-operators-plus-and.md)  
  
-   [Unary negation operator (-)](../cpp/unary-plus-and-negation-operators-plus-and.md)  
  
-   [Logical negation operator (!)](../cpp/logical-negation-operator-exclpt.md)  
  
-   [One's complement operator (~)](../cpp/one-s-complement-operator-tilde.md)  
  
-   [Prefix increment operator (++)](../cpp/prefix-increment-and-decrement-operators-increment-and-decrement.md)  
  
-   [Prefix decrement operator (--)](../cpp/prefix-increment-and-decrement-operators-increment-and-decrement.md)  
  
-   [Cast operator ()](../cpp/cast-operator-parens.md)  
  
-   [sizeof operator](../cpp/sizeof-operator.md)  
  
-   [__uuidof operator](../cpp/uuidof-operator.md)  
  
-   [__alignof operator](../cpp/alignof-operator.md)  
  
-   [new operator](../cpp/new-operator-cpp.md)  
  
-   [delete operator](../cpp/delete-operator-cpp.md)  
  
 These operators have right-to-left associativity. Unary expressions generally involve syntax that precedes a postfix or primary expression.  
  
 The following are the possible forms of unary expressions.  
  
-   *postfix-expression*  
  
-   `++` *unary-expression*  
  
-   `--` *unary-expression*  
  
-   *unary-operator* *cast-expression*  
  
-   **sizeof** *unary-expression*  
  
-   `sizeof(` *type-name* `)`  
  
-   `decltype(` *expression* `)`  
  
-   *allocation-expression*  
  
-   *deallocation-expression*  
  
 Any *postfix-expression* is considered a *unary-expression*, and because any primary expression is considered a *postfix-expression*, any primary expressions is considered a *unary-expression* also. For more information, see [Postfix Expressions](../cpp/postfix-expressions.md) and [Primary Expressions](../cpp/primary-expressions.md).  
  
 A *unary-operator* consists of one or more of the following symbols: `* & + - ! ~`  
  
 The *cast-expression* is a unary expression with an optional cast to change the type. For more information see [Cast Operator: ()](../cpp/cast-operator-parens.md).  
  
 An *expression* can be any expression. For more information, see [Expressions](../cpp/expressions-cpp.md).  
  
 The *allocation-expression* refers to the **new** operator. The *deallocation-expression* refers to the **delete** operator. For more information, see the links earlier in this topic.
