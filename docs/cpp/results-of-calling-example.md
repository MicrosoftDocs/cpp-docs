# Results of Calling Example

**Microsoft Specific**

## `__cdecl`

The C decorated function name is `_MyFunc`.

The **`__cdecl`** calling convention

## `__stdcall` and `thiscall`

The C decorated name (**`__stdcall`**) is `_MyFunc@20`. The C++ decorated name is implementation-specific.

The __stdcall and thiscall calling conventions

## `__fastcall`

The C decorated name (**`__fastcall`**) is `@MyFunc@20`. The C++ decorated name is implementation-specific.
