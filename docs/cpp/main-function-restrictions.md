# main Function Restrictions

Several restrictions apply to the **main** function that do not apply to any other C++ functions. The **main** function:

- Cannot be overloaded (see [Function Overloading](function-overloading.md)).

- Cannot be declared as **inline**.

- Cannot be declared as **static**.

- Cannot have its address taken.

- Cannot be called.
