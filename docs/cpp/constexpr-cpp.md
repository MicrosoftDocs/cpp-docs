# constexpr (C++)

The keyword **constexpr** was introduced in C++11 and improved in C++14. It means *constant expression*. Like **const**, it can be applied to variables so that a compiler error will be raised if any code attempts to modify the value. Unlike **const**, **constexpr** can also be applied to functions and class constructors. **constexpr** indicates that the value, or return value, is constant and, if possible, will be computed at compile time.

A **constexpr** integral value can be used wherever a const integer is required, such as in template arguments and array declarations. And when a value can be computed at compile time instead of run time, it can help your program run faster and use less memory.

To limit the complexity of computing compile time constants, and their potential impacts of compilation time, the C++14 standard requires that the types involved in constant expressions be restricted to [literal types](trivial-standard-layout-and-pod-types.md#literal_types).

## Syntax

```
constexpr  literal-type  identifier = constant-expression;
constexpr  literal-type  identifier { constant-expression };
constexpr literal-type identifier(params );
constexpr ctor (params);
```

## Parameters

 *params*  
One or more parameters which must be a literal type and must itself be a constant expression.

## Return Value

 A constexpr variable or function must return a [literal type](trivial-standard-layout-and-pod-types.md#literal_types).

## constexpr variables

 The primary difference between const and constexpr variables is that the initialization of a const variable can be deferred until run time whereas a constexpr variable must be initialized at compile time.  All constexpr variables are const.

- A variable can be declared with **constexpr**, if it has a literal type and is initialized. If the initialization is performed by a constructor, the constructor must be declared as **constexpr**.

- A reference may be declared as constexpr if the object that it references has been initialized by a constant expression and any implicit conversions that are invoked during initialization are also constant expressions.

- All declarations of a **constexpr** variable or function must have the **constexpr** specifier.

```cpp
constexpr float x = 42.0;
constexpr float y{108};
constexpr float z = exp(5, 3);
constexpr int i; // Error! Not initialized
int j = 0;
constexpr int k = j + 1; //Error! j not a constant expression
```

## <a name="constexpr_functions"></a> constexpr functions

A **constexpr** function is one whose return value can be computed at compile when consuming code requires it.  When its arguments are **constexpr** values, and consuming code requires the return value at compile time, for example to initialize a **constexpr** variable or provide a non-type template argument, it produces a compile-time constant. When called with non-**constexpr** arguments, or when its value is not required at compile-time, it produces a value at run time like a regular function.  (This dual behavior saves you from having to write **constexpr** and non-**constexpr** versions of the same function.)

A **constexpr** function or constructor is implicitly **inline**.

The following rules apply to constexpr functions:

- A **constexpr** function must accept and return only [literal types](trivial-standard-layout-and-pod-types.md#literal_types).

- A **constexpr** function can be recursive.

- It cannot be [virtual](../cpp/virtual-cpp.md). A a constructor cannot be defined as constexpr if the enclosing class has any virtual base classes.

- The body can be defined as `= default` or `= delete`.

- The body can contain no **goto** statements or try blocks.

- An explicit specialization of a non-constexpr template can be declared as **constexpr**:

- An explicit specialization of a **constexpr** template does not have to also be **constexpr**:

The following rules apply to **constexpr** functions in Visual Studio 2017 and later:

- It may contain **if** and **switch** statements, and all looping statements including **for**, range-based for, **while**, and **do-while**.
 
- It may contain local variable declarations, but the variable must be initialized, must be a literal type, and cannot be static or thread-local. The locally-declared variable is not required to be const and may mutate.

- A constexpr non-static member function is not required to be implicitly const.


```cpp
constexpr float exp(float x, int n)
{
    return n == 0 ? 1 :
        n % 2 == 0 ? exp(x * x, n / 2) :
        exp(x * x, (n - 1) / 2) * x;
};
```

> [!TIP]
> Note: In the Visual Studio debugger, when debugging a non-optimised Debug build, you can tell whether a **constexpr** function is being evaluated at compile time by putting a breakpoint inside it. If the breakpoint is hit, the function was called at run-time.  If not, then the function was called at compile time.

## extern constexpr

The [/Zc:externConstexpr](../build/reference/zc-externconstexpr.md) compiler option causes the compiler to apply [external linkage]() to variables declared by using **extern constexpr**. In earlier versions of Visual Studio, and by default or if **/Zc:externConstexpr-** is specified, Visual Studio applies internal linkage to **constexpr** variables even if the **extern** keyword is used. The **/Zc:externConstexpr** option is available starting in Visual Studio 2017 Update 15.6. and is off by default. The /permissive- option does not enable /Zc:externConstexpr.

## Example

 The following example shows **constexpr** variables, functions and a user-defined type. Note that in the last statement in main(), the **constexpr** member function GetValue() is a run-time call because the value is not required to be known at compile time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Pass by value
constexpr float exp(float x, int n)
{
    return n == 0 ? 1 :
        n % 2 == 0 ? exp(x * x, n / 2) :
        exp(x * x, (n - 1) / 2) * x;
};

// Pass by reference
constexpr float exp2(const float& x, const int& n)
{
    return n == 0 ? 1 :
        n % 2 == 0 ? exp2(x * x, n / 2) :
        exp2(x * x, (n - 1) / 2) * x;
};

// Compile time computation of array length
template<typename T, int N>
constexpr int length(const T(&ary)[N])
{
    return N;
}

// Recursive constexpr function
constexpr int fac(int n)
{
    return n == 1 ? 1 : n*fac(n - 1);
}

// User-defined type
class Foo
{
public:
    constexpr explicit Foo(int i) : _i(i) {}
    constexpr int GetValue()
    {
        return _i;
    }
private:
    int _i;
};

int main()
{
    //foo is const:
    constexpr Foo foo(5);
    // foo = Foo(6); //Error!

    //Compile time:
    constexpr float x = exp(5, 3);
    constexpr float y { exp(2, 5) };
    constexpr int val = foo.GetValue();
    constexpr int f5 = fac(5);
    const int nums[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    const int nums2[length(nums) * 2] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };

    //Run time:
    cout << "The value of foo is " << foo.GetValue() << endl;

}
```
