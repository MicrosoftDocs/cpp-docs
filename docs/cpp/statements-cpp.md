# Statements (C++)

C++ statements are the program elements that control how and in what order objects are manipulated. This section includes:

- [Overview](../cpp/overview-of-cpp-statements.md)

- [Labeled Statements](../cpp/labeled-statements.md)

- Categories of Statements

  - [Expression statements](../cpp/expression-statement.md). These statements evaluate an expression for its side effects or for its return value.

  - [Null statements](../cpp/null-statement.md). These statements can be provided where a statement is required by the C++ syntax but where no action is to be taken.

  - [Compound statements](../cpp/compound-statements-blocks.md). These statements are groups of statements enclosed in curly braces ({ }). They can be used wherever a single statement may be used.

  - [Selection statements](../cpp/selection-statements-cpp.md). These statements perform a test; they then execute one section of code if the test evaluates to true (nonzero). They may execute another section of code if the test evaluates to false.

  - [Iteration statements](../cpp/iteration-statements-cpp.md). These statements provide for repeated execution of a block of code until a specified termination criterion is met.

  - [Jump statements](../cpp/jump-statements-cpp.md). These statements either transfer control immediately to another location in the function or return control from the function.

  - [Declaration statements](declarations-and-definitions-cpp.md). Declarations introduce a name into a program.

For information on exception handling statements see [Exception Handling](../cpp/exception-handling-in-visual-cpp.md).
