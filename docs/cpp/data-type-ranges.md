# Data Type Ranges

The Microsoft C++ 32-bit and 64-bit compilers recognize the types in the table later in this article.

```cpp
- int (unsigned int)
- __int8 (unsigned __int8)
- __int16 (unsigned __int16)
- __int32 (unsigned __int32)
- __int64 (unsigned __int64)
- short (unsigned short)
- long (unsigned long)
- long long (unsigned long long)
```

If its name begins with two underscores (`__`), the data type is nonstandard.

The ranges specified in the following table are inclusive-inclusive.

|Type Name|Bytes|Other Names|Range of Values|
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
|**`int`**|4|**`signed`**|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|
|**`unsigned int`**|4|**`unsigned`**|0 to 4,294,967,295|
|**`__int8`**|1|**`char`**|-128 to 127|
|**`unsigned __int8`**|1|**`unsigned char`**|0 to 255|
|**`__int16`**|2|**`short`**, **`short int`**, **`signed short int`**|-32,768 to 32,767|
|**`unsigned __int16`**|2|**`unsigned short`**, **`unsigned short int`**|0 to 65,535|
|**`__int32`**|4|**`signed`**, **`signed int`**, **`int`**|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|
|**`unsigned __int32`**|4|**`unsigned`**, **`unsigned int`**|0 to 4,294,967,295|
|**`__int64`**|8|**`long long`**, **`signed long long`**|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|
|**`unsigned __int64`**|8|**`unsigned long long`**|0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615|
|**`bool`**|1|none|**`false`** or **`true`**|
|**`char`**|1|none|-128 to 127 by default<br /><br /> 0 to 255 when compiled by using [`/J`](../build/reference/j-default-char-type-is-unsigned.md)|
|**`signed char`**|1|none|-128 to 127|
|**`unsigned char`**|1|none|0 to 255|
|**`short`**|2|**`short int`**, **`signed short int`**|-32,768 to 32,767|
|**`unsigned short`**|2|**`unsigned short int`**|0 to 65,535|
|**`long`**|4|**`long int`**, **`signed long int`**|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|
|**`unsigned long`**|4|**`unsigned long int`**|0 to 4,294,967,295|
|**`long long`**|8|none (but equivalent to **`__int64`**)|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|
|**`unsigned long long`**|8|none (but equivalent to **`unsigned __int64`**)|0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615|
|**`enum`**|varies|none| |
|**`float`**|4|none|3.4E +/- 38 (seven digits)|
|**`double`**|8|none|1.7E +/- 308 (fifteen digits)|
|**`long double`**|same as **`double`**|none|Same as **`double`**|
|**`wchar_t`**|2|**`__wchar_t`**|0 to 65,535|

A variable of **`__wchar_t`** designates either a wide-character type or multibyte-character type. Use the `L` prefix before a character or string constant to designate the wide-character-type constant.

**`signed`** and **`unsigned`** are modifiers that you can use with any integral type except **`bool`**. Note that **`char`**, **`signed char`**, and **`unsigned char`** are three distinct types for the purposes of mechanisms like overloading and templates.

The **`int`** and **`unsigned int`** types have a size of 4 bytes. However, portable code shouldn't depend on the size of **`int`** because the language standard allows this to be implementation-specific.

C/C++ in Visual Studio also supports sized integer types. For more information, see [`__int8, __int16, __int32, __int64`](../cpp/int8-int16-int32-int64.md) and [Integer Limits](../cpp/integer-limits.md).

For more information about the restrictions of the sizes of each type, see [Built-in types](../cpp/fundamental-types-cpp.md).

The range of enumerated types varies depending on the language context and specified compiler flags. For more information, see [C Enumeration Declarations](../c-language/c-enumeration-declarations.md) and [Enumerations](../cpp/enumerations-cpp.md).
