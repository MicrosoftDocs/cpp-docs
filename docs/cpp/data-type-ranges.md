# Data Type Ranges
Visual C++ 32-bit and 64-bit compilers recognize the types in the table later in this article.  
  
-   `int` (`unsigned int`)  
  
-   `__int8` (`unsigned __int8`)  
  
-   `__int16` (`unsigned __int16`)  
  
-   `__int32` (`unsigned __int32`)  
  
-   `__int64` (`unsigned __int64`)  
  
-   `short` (`unsigned short`)  
  
-   `long` (`unsigned long`)  
  
-   `long` `long` (`unsigned long long`)  
  
 If its name begins with two underscores (`__`), a data type is non-standard.  
  
 The ranges that are specified in the following table are inclusive-inclusive.  
  
|Type Name|Bytes|Other Names|Range of Values|  
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|  
|**int**|4|**signed**|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|  
|**unsigned int**|4|**unsigned**|0 to 4,294,967,295|  
|**__int8**|1|**char**|-128 to 127|  
|**unsigned __int8**|1|**unsigned char**|0 to 255|  
|**__int16**|2|**short**, **short int**, **signed short int**|-32,768 to 32,767|  
|**unsigned __int16**|2|**unsigned short**, **unsigned short int**|0 to 65,535|  
|**__int32**|4|**signed**, **signed int**, **int**|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|  
|**unsigned __int32**|4|**unsigned**, **unsigned int**|0 to 4,294,967,295|  
|**__int64**|8|**long long**, **signed long long**|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|  
|**unsigned __int64**|8|**unsigned long long**|0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615|  
|**bool**|1|none|**false** or **true**|  
|**char**|1|none|-128 to 127 by default<br /><br /> 0 to 255 when compiled by using [/J](../build/reference/j-default-char-type-is-unsigned.md)|  
|**signed char**|1|none|-128 to 127|  
|**unsigned char**|1|none|0 to 255|  
|**short**|2|**short int**, **signed short int**|-32,768 to 32,767|  
|**unsigned short**|2|**unsigned short int**|0 to 65,535|  
|**long**|4|**long int**, **signed long int**|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|  
|**unsigned long**|4|**unsigned long int**|0 to 4,294,967,295|  
|**long long**|8|none (but equivalent to **__int64**)|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|  
|**unsigned long long**|8|none (but equivalent to **unsigned __int64**)|0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615|  
|**enum**|varies|none| |  
|**float**|4|none|3.4E +/- 38 (7 digits)|  
|**double**|8|none|1.7E +/- 308 (15 digits)|  
|**long double**|same as **double**|none|Same as **double**|  
|**wchar_t**|2|**__wchar_t**|0 to 65,535|  
  
 Depending on how it's used, a variable of **__wchar_t** designates either a wide-character type or multibyte-character type. Use the `L` prefix before a character or string constant to designate the wide-character-type constant.  
  
 **signed** and **unsigned** are modifiers that you can use with any integral type except **bool**. Note that **char**, **signed char**, and **unsigned char** are three distinct types for the purposes of mechanisms like overloading and templates.  
  
 The **int** and **unsigned int** types have a size of four bytes. However, portable code should not depend on the size of **int** because the language standard allows this to be implementation-specific.  
  
 C/C++ in Visual Studio also supports sized integer types. For more information, see [__int8, \__int16, \__int32, \__int64](../cpp/int8-int16-int32-int64.md) and [Integer Limits](../cpp/integer-limits.md).  
  
 For more information about the restrictions of the sizes of each type, see [Fundamental Types](../cpp/fundamental-types-cpp.md).  
  
 The range of enumerated types varies depending on the language context and specified compiler flags. For more information, see [C Enumeration Declarations](../c-language/c-enumeration-declarations.md) and [Enumerations](../cpp/enumerations-cpp.md).
