# Punctuators (C++)
Punctuators in C++ have syntactic and semantic meaning to the compiler but do not, of themselves, specify an operation that yields a value. Some punctuators, either alone or in combination, can also be C++ operators or be significant to the preprocessor.  

 Any of the following characters are considered punctuators:  

```  
! % ^ & * ( ) - + = { } | ~  
[ ] \ ; ' : " < > ? , . / #  
```  

 The punctuators **[ ]**, **( )**, and **{ }** must appear in pairs after [translation phase](../preprocessor/phases-of-translation.md) 4.
