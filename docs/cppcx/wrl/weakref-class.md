# `WeakRef` class

Represents a *weak reference* that can be used by only the Windows Runtime, not classic COM. A weak reference represents an object that might or might not be accessible.

## Syntax

```cpp
class WeakRef : public ComPtr<IWeakReference>;
```

## Members

### Public constructors

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[`WeakRef::WeakRef` constructor](#weakref)|Initializes a new instance of the `WeakRef` class.|
|[`WeakRef::~WeakRef` destructor](#tilde-weakref)|Deinitializes the current instance of the `WeakRef` class.|

### Public methods

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[`WeakRef::As`](#as)|Sets the specified `ComPtr` pointer parameter to represent the specified interface.|
|[`WeakRef::AsIID`](#asiid)|Sets the specified `ComPtr` pointer parameter to represent the specified interface ID.|
|[`WeakRef::CopyTo`](#copyto)|Assigns a pointer to an interface, if available, to the specified pointer variable.|

### Public operators

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[`WeakRef::operator&`](#operator-ampersand-operator)|Returns a `ComPtrRef` object that represents the current `WeakRef` object.|

## Remarks

A `WeakRef` object maintains a *strong reference*, which is associated with an object, and can be valid or invalid. Call the `As()` or `AsIID()` method to obtain a strong reference. When the strong reference is valid, it can access the associated object. When the strong reference is invalid (**`nullptr`**), the associated object is inaccessible.

A `WeakRef` object is typically used to represent an object whose existence is controlled by an external thread or application. For example, construct a `WeakRef` object from a reference to a file object. While the file is open, the strong reference is valid. But if the file is closed, the strong reference becomes invalid.

There's a behavior change in the [`As`](#as), [`AsIID`](#asiid), and [`CopyTo`](#copyto) methods in the Windows SDK. Previously, after calling any of these methods, you could check the `WeakRef` for **`nullptr`** to determine if a strong reference was successfully obtained, as in the following code:

```cpp
WeakRef wr;
strongComptrRef.AsWeak(&wr);

// Now suppose that the object strongComPtrRef points to no longer exists
// and the following code tries to get a strong ref from the weak ref:
ComPtr<ISomeInterface> strongRef;
HRESULT hr = wr.As(&strongRef);

// This check won't work with the Windows 10 SDK version of the library.
// Check the input pointer instead.
if(wr == nullptr)
{
    wprintf(L"Couldn't get strong ref!");
}
```

The above code doesn't work when using the Windows 10 SDK (or later). Instead, check the pointer that was passed in for **`nullptr`**.

```cpp
if (strongRef == nullptr)
{
    wprintf(L"Couldn't get strong ref!");
}
```

## Inheritance hierarchy

[`ComPtr`](comptr-class.md)\
&emsp;â””&nbsp;[`WeakRef`](weakref-class.md)

## Requirements

**Header:** *`client.h`*

**Namespace:** `Microsoft::WRL`

## <a name="weakref"></a> `WeakRef::WeakRef` constructor

Initializes a new instance of the `WeakRef` class.

```cpp
WeakRef();
WeakRef(
   decltype(__nullptr)
);

WeakRef(
   _In_opt_ IWeakReference* ptr
);

WeakRef(
   const ComPtr<IWeakReference>& ptr
);

WeakRef(
   const WeakRef& ptr
);

WeakRef(
   _Inout_ WeakRef&& ptr
);
```

### Parameters

*`ptr`*\
A pointer, reference, or rvalue-reference to an existing object that initializes the current `WeakRef` object.

### Remarks

The first constructor initializes an empty `WeakRef` object. The second constructor initializes a `WeakRef` object from a pointer to the `IWeakReference` interface. The third constructor initializes a `WeakRef` object from a reference to a `ComPtr<IWeakReference>` object. The fourth and fifth constructors initialize a `WeakRef` object from another `WeakRef` object.

## <a name="tilde-weakref"></a> `WeakRef::~WeakRef` destructor

Deinitializes the current instance of the `WeakRef` class.

```cpp
~WeakRef();
```

## <a name="as"></a> `WeakRef::As`

Sets the specified `ComPtr` pointer parameter to represent the specified interface.

```cpp
template<typename U>
HRESULT As(
   _Out_ ComPtr<U>* ptr
);

template<typename U>
HRESULT As(
   _Out_ Details::ComPtrRef<ComPtr<U>> ptr
);
```

### Parameters

*`U`*\
An interface ID.

*`ptr`*\
When this operation completes, an object that represents parameter *U*.

### Return value

- `S_OK` if this operation succeeds; otherwise, an HRESULT that indicates the reason the operation failed, and *`ptr`* is set to **`nullptr`**.

- `S_OK` if this operation succeeds, but the current `WeakRef` object has already been released. Parameter *`ptr`* is set to **`nullptr`**.

- `S_OK` if this operation succeeds, but the current `WeakRef` object isn't derived from parameter *`U`*. Parameter *`ptr`* is set to **`nullptr`**.

### Remarks

An error is emitted if parameter *`U`* is `IWeakReference`, or isn't derived from `IInspectable`.

The first template is the form that you should use in your code. The second template is an internal, helper specialization; it supports C++ language features such as the [`auto`](../../cpp/auto-cpp.md) type deduction keyword.

Starting in the Windows 10 SDK, this method doesn't set the `WeakRef` instance to **`nullptr`** if the weak reference couldn't be obtained, so you should avoid error-checking code that checks the `WeakRef` for **`nullptr`**. Instead, check *ptr* for **`nullptr`**.

## <a name="asiid"></a> `WeakRef::AsIID`

Sets the specified `ComPtr` pointer parameter to represent the specified interface ID.

```cpp
HRESULT AsIID(
   REFIID riid,
   _Out_ ComPtr<IInspectable>* ptr
);
```

### Parameters

*`riid`*\
An interface ID.

*`ptr`*\
When this operation completes, an object that represents parameter *`riid`*.

### Return value

- `S_OK` if this operation succeeds; otherwise, an HRESULT that indicates the reason the operation failed, and *`ptr`* is set to **`nullptr`**.

- `S_OK` if this operation succeeds, but the current `WeakRef` object has already been released. Parameter *`ptr`* is set to **`nullptr`**.

- `S_OK` if this operation succeeds, but the current `WeakRef` object isn't derived from parameter *`riid`*. Parameter *`ptr`* is set to **`nullptr`**. For more information, see Remarks.

### Remarks

An error is emitted if parameter *`riid`* isn't derived from `IInspectable`. This error supersedes the return value.

The first template is the form that you should use in your code. The second template (not shown here, but declared in the header file) is an internal, helper specialization that supports C++ language features such as the [`auto`](../../cpp/auto-cpp.md) type deduction keyword.

Starting in the Windows 10 SDK, this method doesn't set the `WeakRef` instance to **`nullptr`** if the weak reference couldn't be obtained, so you should avoid error-checking code that checks the `WeakRef` for **`nullptr`**. Instead, check *`ptr`* for **`nullptr`**.

## <a name="copyto"></a> `WeakRef::CopyTo`

Assigns a pointer to an interface, if available, to the specified pointer variable.

```cpp
HRESULT CopyTo(
   REFIID riid,
   _Deref_out_ IInspectable** ptr
);

template<typename U>
HRESULT CopyTo(
   _Deref_out_ U** ptr
);

HRESULT CopyTo(
   _Deref_out_ IWeakReference** ptr
);
```

### Parameters

*`U`*\
Pointer an `IInspectable` interface. An error is emitted if *`U`* isn't derived from `IInspectable`.

*`riid`*\
An interface ID. An error is emitted if *`riid`* isn't derived from `IWeakReference`.

*`ptr`*\
A doubly indirect pointer to `IInspectable` or `IWeakReference`.

### Return value

`S_OK` if successful; otherwise, an HRESULT that describes the failure. For more information, see **Remarks**.

### Remarks

A return value of `S_OK` means that this operation succeeded, but doesn't indicate whether the weak reference was resolved to a strong reference. If `S_OK` is returned, test that parameter *`ptr`* is a strong reference; that is, parameter *`ptr`* isn't equal to **`nullptr`**.

Starting in the Windows 10 SDK, this method doesn't set the `WeakRef` instance to **`nullptr`** if the weak reference couldn't be obtained, so you should avoid error checking code that checks the `WeakRef` for **`nullptr`**. Instead, check *`ptr`* for **`nullptr`**.

## <a name="operator-ampersand-operator"></a> `WeakRef::operator&`

Returns a `ComPtrRef` object that represents the current `WeakRef` object.

```cpp
Details::ComPtrRef<WeakRef> operator&() throw()
```

### Return value

A `ComPtrRef` object that represents the current `WeakRef` object.

### Remarks

`WeakRef::operator&` is an internal helper operator that's not meant to be used in your code.
