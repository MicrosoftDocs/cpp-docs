# Template ref classes (C++/CX)

C++ templates are not published to metadata and therefore cannot have public or protected accessibility in your program. You can, of course, use standard C++ templates internally in your program. In addition, you can define a private ref class as a template and you can declare an explicitly specialized template ref class as a private member in a public ref class.

## Authoring ref class templates

The following example shows how to declare a private ref class as a template, and also how to declare a standard C++ template and how declare them both as members in a public ref class. Note that the standard C++ template can be specialized by a Windows Runtime type, in this case a Platform::String^.
