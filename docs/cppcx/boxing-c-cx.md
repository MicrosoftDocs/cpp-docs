# Boxing (C++/CX)

*Boxing* is wrapping a value type variable such as [Windows::Foundation::DateTime](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.foundation.datetime.aspx)—or a fundamental scalar type such as `int`—in a ref class when the variable is passed to a method that takes [Platform::Object^](../cppcx/platform-object-class.md) as its input type.

## Passing a value type to an Object^ parameter

Although you don't have to explicitly box a variable to pass it to a method parameter of type [Platform::Object^](../cppcx/platform-object-class.md), you do have to explicitly cast back to the original type when you retrieve values that have been previously boxed.

[!code-cpp[cx_boxing#01](../cppcx/codesnippet/CPP/cx_boxing/class1.cpp#01)]

### Using Platform::IBox\<T> to support nullable value types

C# and Visual Basic support the concept of nullable value types. In C++/CX, you can use the `Platform::IBox<T>` type to expose public methods that support nullable value type parameters. The following example shows a C++/CX public method that returns null when a C# caller passes null for one of the arguments.

[!code-cpp[cx_boxing#02](../cppcx/codesnippet/CPP/cx_boxing/class1.h#02)]

In a C# XAML client, you can consume it like this:

```

// C# client code
    BoxingDemo.Class1 obj = new BoxingDemo.Class1();
    int? a = null;
    int? b = 5;
    var result = obj.Multiply(a,b); //result = null

```
