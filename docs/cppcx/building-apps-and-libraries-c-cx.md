# Building apps and libraries (C++/CX)
The topics in this section provide a few details about using the build system to produce a Universal Windows Platform app or Windows Runtime component.  
  
## In this section  
  
-   [Compiler and Linker options](../cppcx/compiler-and-linker-options-c-cx.md)  
  
-   [Static libraries](../cppcx/static-libraries-c-cx.md)  
  
-   [DLLs](../cppcx/dlls-c-cx.md)  
  
 Note: Visual C++ does not support profile guided optimizations for Universal Windows Platform. If you attempt to build a project with these options set in the IDE, a build error will result. Console applications are also not supported.
