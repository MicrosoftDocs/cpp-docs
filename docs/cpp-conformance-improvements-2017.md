# C++ conformance improvements in Visual Studio 2017 versions 15.0, [15.3](#improvements_153), [15.5](#improvements_155), [15.6](#improvements_156), [15.7](#improvements_157), [15.8](#update_158)

With support for generalized constexpr and NSDMI for aggregates, the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is now complete for features added in the C++14 Standard. Note that the compiler still lacks a few features from the C++11 and C++98 Standards. See [Visual C++ Language Conformance](visual-cpp-language-conformance.md) for a table that shows the current state of the compiler.

## C++11

### Expression SFINAE support in more libraries

The compiler continues to improve its support for expression SFINAE, which is required for template argument deduction and substitution where decltype and constexpr expressions may appear as template parameters. For more information, see [Expression SFINAE improvements in Visual Studio 2017 RC](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/06/07/expression-sfinae-improvements-in-vs-2015-update-3).

## C++ 14

### NSDMI for Aggregates

An aggregate is an array or a class with no user-provided constructor, no private or protected non-static data members, no base classes, and no virtual functions. Beginning in C++14 aggregates may contain member initializers. For more information, see [Member initializers and aggregates](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3605.html).

### Extended constexpr

Expressions declared as constexpr are now allowed to contain certain kinds of declarations, if and switch statements, loop statements, and mutation of objects whose lifetime began within the constexpr expression evaluation. Also, there is no longer a requirement that a constexpr non-static member function be implicitly const. For more information, see [Relaxing constraints on constexpr functions](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3652.html).

## C++17

### Terse static_assert

the message parameter for static_assert is optional. For more information, see [Extending static_assert, v2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3928.pdf).

### [[fallthrough]] attribute

In **/std:c++17** mode, the [[fallthrough]] attribute can be used in the context of switch statements as a hint to the compiler that the fall-through behavior is intended. This prevents the compiler from issuing warnings in such cases. For more information, see [Wording for [[fallthrough]] attribute](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0188r0.pdf).

### Generalized range-based for loops

Range-based for loops no longer require that begin() and end() return objects of the same type. This enables end() to return a sentinel as used by ranges in [range-v3](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) and the completed-but-not-quite-published Ranges Technical Specification. For more information, see [Generalizing the Range-Based For Loop](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0184r0.html).

## <a name="improvements_153"></a> Improvements in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3

### constexpr lambdas

Lambda expressions may now be used in constant expressions. For more information, see [constexpr lambda expressions in C++](cpp/lambda-expressions-constexpr.md).

### if constexpr in function templates

A function template may contain `if constexpr` statements to enable compile-time branching. For more information, see [if constexpr statements](cpp/if-else-statement-cpp.md#if_constexpr).

### Selection statements with initializers

An `if` statement may include an initializer that introduces a variable at block scope within the statement itself. For more information, see [if statements with initializer](cpp/if-else-statement-cpp.md#if_with_init).

### [[maybe_unused]] and [[nodiscard]] attributes

New attributes to silence warnings when an entity is not used, or to create a warning if the return value of a function call is discarded. For more information, see [Attributes in C++](cpp/attributes.md).

### Using attribute namespaces without repetition

New syntax to enable only a single namespace identifier in an attribute list. For more information, see [Attributes in C++](cpp/attributes.md).

### Structured bindings

It is now possible in a single declaration to store a value with individual names for its components, when the value is an array, a std::tuple or std::pair, or has all public non-static data members. For more information, see [Structured Bindings](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0144r0.pdf) and [Returning multiple values from a function](cpp/functions-cpp.md#multi_val).

### Construction rules for enum class values

There is now an implicit/non-narrowing conversion from a scoped enumeration's underlying type to the enumeration itself, when its definition introduces no enumerator and the source uses a list-initialization syntax. For more information, see [Construction Rules for enum class Values](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0138r2.pdf) and [Enumerations](cpp/enumerations-cpp.md#no_enumerators).

### Capturing \*this by value

The `*this` object in a lambda expression may now be captured by value. This enables scenarios in which the lambda is invoked in parallel and asynchronous operations, especially on newer machine architectures. For more information, see [Lambda Capture of \*this by Value as [=,\*this]](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0018r3.html).

### Removing operator++ for bool

`operator++` is no longer supported on `bool` types. For more information, see [Remove Deprecated operator++(bool)](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0002r1.html).

### Removing deprecated "register" keyword

The `register` keyword, previously deprecated (and ignored by the compiler), is now removed from the language. For more information, see [Remove Deprecated Use of the register Keyword](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0001r1.html).

For the complete list of conformance improvements up through Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, see [Visual C++ What's New 2003 through 2015](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt723604.aspx).

## <a name="improvements_155"></a>  Improvements in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5

Features marked with [14] are available unconditionally even in **/std:c++14** mode.

### New compiler switch for extern constexpr

In earlier versions of Visual Studio, the compiler always gave a `constexpr` variable internal linkage even when the variable was marked `extern`. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, a new compiler switch, [/Zc:externConstexpr](build/reference/zc-externconstexpr.md), enables correct standards-conforming behavior. For more information, see [extern constexpr linkage](#extern_linkage).

### Removing Dynamic Exception Specifications

[P0003R5](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0003r5.html) Dynamic exception specifications were deprecated in C++11. the feature is removed from C++17, but the (still) deprecated `throw()` specification is retained strictly as an alias for `noexcept(true)`. For more information, see [Dynamic exception specification removal and noexcept](#noexcept_removal).

### not_fn()

[P0005R4](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0005r4.html) `not_fn` is a replacement of `not1` and `not2`.

### Rewording enable_shared_from_this

[P0033R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0033r1.html) `enable_shared_from_this` was added in C++11. The C++17 Standard updates the specification to better handle certain corner cases. [14]

### Splicing Maps And Sets

[P0083R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0083r3.pdf) This feature enables extraction of nodes from associative containers (e.g., map, set, unordered\_map, unordered\_set) which can then be modified and inserted back into the same container or a different container that uses the same node type. (A common use case is to extract a node from a `std::map`, change the key, and reinsert.)

### Deprecating Vestigial Library Parts

[P0174R2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0174r2.html) Several features of the C++ Standard library have been superseded by newer features over the years, or else have been found to be not very useful or to be problematic. These features are officially deprecated in C++17.

### Removing Allocator Support In std::function

[P0302R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0302r1.html) Prior to C++17 the class template `std::function` had several constructors that took an allocator argument. However, the use of allocators in this context was problematic, and the semantics were unclear. Therefore these contructors were removed.

### Fixes for not_fn()

[P0358R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0358r1.html) New wording for `std::not_fn` provides support of propagation of value category in case of wrapper invocation.

### shared_ptr\<T[]>, shared_ptr\<T[N]>

[P0414R2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0414r2.html) Merging `shared_ptr` changes from Library Fundamentals to C++17. [14]

### Fixing shared_ptr for Arrays

[P0497R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0497r0.html) Fixes to shared_ptr support for arrays. [14]

### Clarifying insert_return_type

[P0508R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0508r0.html) The associative containers with unique keys, and the unordered containers with unique keys have a member function `insert` that returns a nested type `insert_return_type`. That return type is now defined as a specialization of a type that is parameterized on the Iterator and NodeType of the container.

### Inline Variables For The STL

[P0607R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0607r0.html)

### Annex D features deprecated

Annex D of the C++ standard contains all the features that have been deprecated, including `shared_ptr::unique()`, `<codecvt>`, and `namespace std::tr1`. When the **/std:c++17** compiler switch is set, almost all the Standard Library features in Annex D are marked as deprecated. For more information, see [Standard Library features in Annex D are marked as deprecated](#annex_d).

The `std::tr2::sys` namespace in `<experimental/filesystem>` now emits a deprecation warning under **/std:c++14** by default, and is now removed under **/std:c++17** by default.

Improved conformance in iostreams by avoiding a non-Standard extension (in-class explicit specializations).

The Standard Library now uses variable templates internally.

The Standard Library has been updated in response to C++17 compiler changes, including the addition of noexcept in the type system and the removal of dynamic-exception-specifications.

## <a name="improvements_156"></a>  Improvements in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6

### C++17 Library Fundamentals V1

[P0220R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0220r1.html) incorporates Library Fundamentals Technical Specification for C++17 into the standard. Covers updates to \<experimental/tuple>, \<experimental/optional>, \<experimental/functional>, \<experimental/any>, \<experimental/string_view> , \<experimental/memory>, \<experimental/memory_resource>,and \<experimental/algorithm>.

### C++17 Improving Class Template Argument Deduction For The STL

[P0739R0](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0739r0.html) Move `adopt_lock_t` to front of parameter list for `scoped_lock` to enable consistent use of `scoped_lock`. Allow `std::variant` constructor to participate in overload resolution in more cases, in order to enable copy assignment.

## <a name="improvements_157"></a> Improvements in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7

### C++17 Rewording inheriting constructors

[P0136R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0136r1.html) specifies that a **using** declaration that names a constructor now makes the corresponding base class constructors visible to initializations of the derived class rather than declaring additional derived class constructors. This is a change from C++14. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 and later, in **/std:c++17** mode, code that is valid in C++14 and uses inheriting constructors may not be valid or may have different semantics.

The following example shows C++14 behavior:

```cpp
struct A {
    template<typename T>
    A(T, typename T::type = 0);
    A(int);
};

struct B : A {
    using A::A;
    B(int n) = delete; // Error C2280
};

B b(42L); // Calls B<long>(long), which calls A(int)
          //  due to substitution failure in A<long>(long).
```

The following example shows **/std:c++17** behavior in Visual Studio 15.7:

```cpp
struct A {
    template<typename T>
    A(T, typename T::type = 0);
    A(int);
};

struct B : A {
    using A::A;
    B(int n)
    {
        //do something
    }
};

B b(42L); // now calls B(int)
```

For more information, see [Constructors](cpp/constructors-cpp.md#inheriting_constructors).

### C++17 Extended aggregate initialization

[P0017R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0017r1.html)

If the constructor of a base class is non-public, but accessible to a derived class, then under **/std:c++17** mode in Visual Studio version 15.7 you can no longer use empty braces to initialize an object of the derived type.

The following example shows C++14 conformant behavior:

```cpp
struct Derived;

struct Base {
    friend struct Derived;
private:
    Base() {}
};

struct Derived : Base {};

Derived d1; // OK. No aggregate init involved.
Derived d2 {}; // OK in C++14: Calls Derived::Derived()
               // which can call Base ctor.
```

In C++17, `Derived` is now considered an aggregate type; therefore, the initialization of `Base` via the private default constructor happens directly as part of the extended aggregate initialization rule. Previously, the `Base` private constructor was called via the `Derived` constructor and it succeeded because of the friend declaration.

The following example shows C++17 behavior in Visual Studio version 15.7 in **/std:c++17** mode:

```cpp
struct Derived;

struct Base {
    friend struct Derived;
private:
    Base() {}
};

struct Derived : Base {
    Derived() {} // add user-defined constructor
                 // to call with {} initialization
};

Derived d1; // OK. No aggregate init involved.

Derived d2 {}; // error C2248: 'Base::Base': cannot access
               // private member declared in class 'Base'
```

### C++17 Declaring non-type template parameters with auto

[P0127R2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0127r2.html)

In **/std:c++17** mode, the compiler can now deduce the type of a non-type template argument that is declared with **auto**:

```cpp
template <auto x> constexpr auto constant = x;

auto v1 = constant<5>;      // v1 == 5, decltype(v1) is int
auto v2 = constant<true>;   // v2 == true, decltype(v2) is bool
auto v3 = constant<'a'>;    // v3 == 'a', decltype(v3) is char
```

One impact of this new feature is that valid C++14 code may not be valid or may have different semantics. For example, some overloads which were previously invalid are now valid. The following example shows C++14 code that compiles because the call to `foo(p)` is bound to `foo(void*);`. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7, in **/std:c++17** mode, the `foo` function template is the best match.

```cpp
template <int N> struct A;
template <typename T, T N> int foo(A<N>*) = delete;

void foo(void *);

void bar(A<0> *p)
{
    foo(p); // OK in C++14
}
```

The following example shows C++17 code in Visual Studio 15.7 in **/std:c++17** mode:

```cpp
template <int N> struct A;
template <typename T, T N> int foo(A<N>*);

void foo(void *);

void bar(A<0> *p)
{
    foo(p); // C2280: 'int foo<int,0>(A<0>*)': attempting to reference a deleted function
}
```

### C++17 Elementary string conversions (partial)

[P0067R5](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0067r5.html) Low-level, locale-independent functions for conversions between integers and strings and between floating-point numbers and strings. (As of Visual Studio 15.7 Preview 2, supported for integers only.)

### C++20 Avoiding unnecessary decay (partial)

[P0777R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0777r1.pdf) Adds differentiation between the concept of "decay" and that of simply removing const or reference qualifiers.  New type trait `remove_reference_t` replaces `decay_t` in some contexts. Support for `remove_cvref_t` is not yet implemented as of Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 Preview 2.

### C++17 Parallel algorithms

[P0024R2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0024r2.html) The Parallelism TS is incorporated into the standard, with minor modifications.

### C++17 hypot(x, y, z)

[P0030R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0030r1.pdf) Adds three new overloads to `std::hypot`, for types **float**, **double**, and **long double**, each of which has three input parameters.

### C++17 \<filesystem>

[P0218R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0218r1.html) Adopts the File System TS into the standard with a few wording modifications.

### C++17 Mathematical special functions

[P0226R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0220r1.html) Adopts previous technical specifications for Mathematical Special Functions into the standard \<cmath> header.

### C++17 Deduction guides for the STL

[P0433R2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0433r2.html) Updates to STL to take advantage of C++17 adoption of [P0091R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0091r3.html), which adds support for class template argument deduction.

### C++17 Repairing elementary string conversions

[P0682R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0682r1.html) Move the new elementary string conversion functions from P0067R5 into a new header \<charconv> and make other improvements, including changing error handling to use `std::errc` instead of `std::error_code`.

### C++17 constexpr for char_traits (partial)

[P0426R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0426r1.html) Changes to `std::traits_type` member functions `length`, `compare`, and `find` in order to make `std::string_view` usable in constant expressions. (In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6, supported for Clang/LLVM only. In version 15.7 Preview 2, support is nearly complete for ClXX as well.)

## Bug fixes in Visual Studio versions 15.0, [15.3](#update_153), [15.5](#update_155), [15.7](#update_157), and [15.8](#update_158)

### Copy-list-initialization

Visual Studio 2017 correctly raises compiler errors related to object creation using initializer lists that were not caught in Visual Studio 2015 and could lead to crashes or undefined runtime behavior. As per N4594 13.3.1.7p1, in copy-list-initialization, the compiler is required to consider an explicit constructor for overload resolution, but must raise an error if that overload is actually chosen.

The following two examples compile in Visual Studio 2015 but not in Visual Studio 2017.

```cpp
struct A
{
    explicit A(int) {}
    A(double) {}
};

int main()
{
    A a1 = { 1 }; // error C3445: copy-list-initialization of 'A' cannot use an explicit constructor
    const A& a2 = { 1 }; // error C2440: 'initializing': cannot convert from 'int' to 'const A &'

}
```

To correct the error, use direct initialization:

```cpp
A a1{ 1 };
const A& a2{ 1 };
```

In Visual Studio 2015, the compiler erroneously treated copy-list-initialization in the same way as regular copy-initialization; it considered only converting constructors for overload resolution. In the following example, Visual Studio 2015 chooses MyInt(23) but Visual Studio 2017 correctly raises the error.

```cpp
// From http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_closed.html#1228
struct MyStore {
    explicit MyStore(int initialCapacity);
};

struct MyInt {
    MyInt(int i);
};

struct Printer {
    void operator()(MyStore const& s);
    void operator()(MyInt const& i);
};

void f() {
    Printer p;
    p({ 23 }); // C3066: there are multiple ways that an object of this type can be called with these arguments
}
```

This example is similar to the previous one but raises a different error. It succeeds in Visual Studio 2015 and fails in Visual Studio 2017 with C2668.

```cpp
struct A {
    explicit A(int) {}
};

struct B {
    B(int) {}
};

void f(const A&) {}
void f(const B&) {}

int main()
{
    f({ 1 }); // error C2668: 'f': ambiguous call to overloaded function
}
```

### Deprecated typedefs

Visual Studio 2017 now issues the correct warning for deprecated typedefs that are declared in a class or struct. The following example compiles without warnings in Visual Studio 2015 but produces C4996 in Visual Studio 2017.

```cpp
struct A
{
    // also for __declspec(deprecated)
    [[deprecated]] typedef int inttype;
};

int main()
{
    A::inttype a = 0; // C4996 'A::inttype': was declared deprecated
}
```

### constexpr

Visual Studio 2017 correctly raises an error when the left-hand operand of a conditionally evaluating operation is not valid in a constexpr context. The following code compiles in Visual Studio 2015 but not in Visual Studio 2017 (C3615 constexpr function 'f' cannot result in a constant expression):

```cpp
template<int N>
struct array
{
    int size() const { return N; }
};

constexpr bool f(const array<1> &arr)
{
    return arr.size() == 10 || arr.size() == 11; // C3615
}
```

To correct the error, either declare the `array::size()` function as `constexpr` or remove the `constexpr` qualifier from `f`.

### Class types passed to variadic functions

In Visual Studio 2017, classes or structs that are passed to a variadic function such as printf must be trivially copyable. When passing such objects, the compiler simply makes a bitwise copy and does not call the constructor or destructor.

```cpp
#include <atomic>
#include <memory>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    std::atomic<int> i(0);
    printf("%i\n", i); // error C4839: non-standard use of class 'std::atomic<int>'
                        // as an argument to a variadic function.
                        // note: the constructor and destructor will not be called;
                        // a bitwise copy of the class will be passed as the argument
                        // error C2280: 'std::atomic<int>::atomic(const std::atomic<int> &)':
                        // attempting to reference a deleted function

    struct S {
        S(int i) : i(i) {}
        S(const S& other) : i(other.i) {}
        operator int() { return i; }
    private:
        int i;
    } s(0);
    printf("%i\n", s); // warning C4840 : non-portable use of class 'main::S'
                      // as an argument to a variadic function
}
```

To correct the error, you can call a member function that returns a trivially copyable type,

```cpp
    std::atomic<int> i(0);
    printf("%i\n", i.load());
```

or else perform a static cast to convert the object before passing it:

```cpp
    struct S {/* as before */} s(0);
    printf("%i\n", static_cast<int>(s))
```

For strings built and managed using CString, the provided `operator LPCTSTR()` should be used to cast a CString object to the C pointer expected by the format string.

```cpp
CString str1;
CString str2 = _T("hello!");
str1.Format(_T("%s"), static_cast<LPCTSTR>(str2));
```

### cv-qualifiers in class construction

In Visual Studio 2015, the compiler sometimes incorrectly ignores the cv-qualifier when generating a class object via a constructor call. This can potentially cause a crash or unexpected runtime behavior. The following example compiles in Visual Studio 2015 but raises a compiler error in Visual Studio 2017:

```cpp
struct S
{
    S(int);
    operator int();
};

int i = (const S)0; // error C2440
```

To correct the error, declare `operator int()` as `const`.

### Access checking on qualified names in templates

Previous versions of the compiler did not perform access checking on qualified names in some template contexts. This can interfere with expected SFINAE behavior where the substitution is expected to fail due to the inaccessibility of a name. This could have potentially caused a crash or unexpected behavior at runtime due to the compiler incorrectly calling the wrong overload of the operator. In Visual Studio 2017, a compiler error is raised. The specific error might vary but typically it is "C2672 no matching overloaded function found". The following code compiles in Visual Studio 2015 but raises an error in Visual Studio 2017:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

template <class T> class S {
    typedef typename T type;
};

template <class T, std::enable_if<std::is_integral<typename S<T>::type>::value, T> * = 0>
bool f(T x);

int main()
{
    f(10); // C2672: No matching overloaded function found.
}
```

### Missing template argument lists

In Visual Studio 2015 and earlier, the compiler did not diagnose missing template argument lists when the template appeared in a template parameter list (for example as part of a default template argument or a non-type template parameter). This can result in unpredictable behavior, including compiler crashes or unexpected runtime behavior. The following code compiles in Visual Studio 2015 but produces an error in Visual Studio 2017.

```cpp
template <class T> class ListNode;
template <class T> using ListNodeMember = ListNode<T> T::*;
template <class T, ListNodeMember M> class ListHead; // C2955: 'ListNodeMember': use of alias
                                                     // template requires template argument list

// correct:  template <class T, ListNodeMember<T> M> class ListHead;
```

### Expression-SFINAE

To support expression-SFINAE, the compiler now parses decltype arguments when the templates are declared rather than instantiated. Consequently, if a non-dependent specialization is found in the decltype argument, it is not deferred to instantiation-time and is processed immediately and any resulting errors are diagnosed at that time.

The following example shows such a compiler error that is raised at the point of declaration:

```cpp
#include <utility>
template <class T, class ReturnT, class... ArgsT>
class IsCallable
{
public:
    struct BadType {};

    template <class U>
    static decltype(std::declval<T>()(std::declval<ArgsT>()...)) Test(int); //C2064. Should be declval<U>

    template <class U>
    static BadType Test(...);

    static constexpr bool value = std::is_convertible<decltype(Test<T>(0)), ReturnT>::value;
};

constexpr bool test1 = IsCallable<int(), int>::value;
static_assert(test1, "PASS1");
constexpr bool test2 = !IsCallable<int*, int>::value;
static_assert(test2, "PASS2");
```

### Classes declared in anonymous namespaces

According to the C++ standard, a class declared inside an anonymous namespace has internal linkage, and therefore cannot be exported. In Visual Studio 2015 and earlier, this rule was not enforced. In Visual Studio 2017 the rule is partially enforced. The following example raises this error in Visual Studio 2017: "error C2201: const anonymous namespace::S1::vftable: must have external linkage in order to be exported/imported."

```cpp
struct __declspec(dllexport) S1 { virtual void f() {} }; //C2201
```

### Default initializers for value class members (C++/CLI)

In Visual Studio 2015 and earlier, the compiler permitted (but ignored) a default member initializer for a member of a value class. Default initialization of a value class always zero-initializes the members; a default constructor is not permitted. In Visual Studio 2017, default member initializers raise a compiler error, as shown in this example:

```cpp
value struct V
{
    int i = 0; // error C3446: 'V::i': a default member initializer
               // is not allowed for a member of a value class
};
```

### Default Indexers (C++/CLI)

In Visual Studio 2015 and earlier, the compiler in some cases misidentified a default property as a default indexer. It was possible to work around the issue by using the identifier `default` to access the property. The workaround itself became problematic after `default` was introduced as a keyword in C++11. Therefore, in Visual Studio 2017 the bugs that required the workaround were fixed, and the compiler now raises an error when `default` is used to access the default property for a class.

```cpp
//class1.cs

using System.Reflection;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    [DefaultMember("Value")]
    public class Class1
    {
        public int Value
        {
            // using attribute on the return type triggers the compiler bug
            [return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.I4)]
            get;
        }
    }
    [DefaultMember("Value")]
    public class Class2
    {
        public int Value
        {
            get;
        }
    }
}

// code.cpp
#using "class1.dll"

void f(ClassLibrary1::Class1 ^r1, ClassLibrary1::Class2 ^r2)
{
       r1->Value; // error
       r1->default;
       r2->Value;
       r2->default; // error
}
```

In Visual Studio 2017, you can access both Value properties by their name:

```cpp
#using "class1.dll"

void f(ClassLibrary1::Class1 ^r1, ClassLibrary1::Class2 ^r2)
{
       r1->Value;
       r2->Value;
}
```

## <a name="update_153"></a> Bug fixes in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3

### Calls to deleted member templates

In previous versions of Visual Studio, the compiler in some cases would fail to emit an error for ill-formed calls to a deleted member template which would’ve potentially caused crashes at runtime. The following code now produces C2280, "'int S\<int>::f\<int>(void)': attempting to reference a deleted function":

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct S {
   template<typename U> static int f() = delete;
};

void g()
{
   decltype(S<int>::f<int>()) i; // this should fail
}
```

To fix the error, declare i as `int`.

### Pre-condition checks for type traits

Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 improves pre-condition checks for type-traits to more strictly follow the standard. One such check is for assignable. The following code produces C2139 in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3:

```cpp
struct S;
enum E;

static_assert(!__is_assignable(S, S), "fail"); // C2139 in 15.3
static_assert(__is_convertible_to(E, E), "fail"); // C2139 in 15.3
```

### New compiler warning and runtime checks on native-to-managed marshaling

Calling from managed functions to native functions requires marshalling. The CLR performs the marshaling but it doesn't understand C++ semantics. If you pass a native object by value, CLR either calls the object's copy-constructor or uses BitBlt, which may cause undefined behavior at runtime.

Now the compiler emits a warning if it can know at compile time that a native object with deleted copy ctor is passed between native and managed boundary by value. For those cases in which the compiler doesn't know at compile time, it injects a runtime check so that the program calls `std::terminate` immediately when an ill-formed marshalling occurs. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, the following code produces warning C4606 "'A': passing argument by value across native and managed boundary requires valid copy constructor. Otherwise the runtime behavior is undefined".

```cpp
class A
{
public:
   A() : p_(new int) {}
   ~A() { delete p_; }

   A(A const &) = delete;
   A(A &&rhs) {
   p_ = rhs.p_;
}

private:
   int *p_;
};

#pragma unmanaged

void f(A a)
{
}

#pragma managed

int main()
{
    f(A()); // This call from managed to native requires marshalling. The CLR doesn't understand C++ and uses BitBlt, which results in a double-free later.
}
```

To fix the error, remove the `#pragma managed` directive to mark the caller as native and avoid marshalling.

### Experimental API warning for WinRT

WinRT APIs that are released for experimentation and feedback are decorated with `Windows.Foundation.Metadata.ExperimentalAttribute`. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, the compiler produces warning C4698 when it encounters the attribute. A few APIs in previous versions of the Windows SDK have already been decorated with the attribute, and calls to these APIs now trigger this compiler warning. Newer Windows SDKs have the attribute removed from all shipped types, but if you are using an older SDK, you'll need to suppress these warnings for all calls to shipped types.

The following code produces warning C4698: "'Windows::Storage::IApplicationDataStatics2::GetForUserAsync' is for evaluation purposes only and is subject to change or removal in future updates":

```cpp
Windows::Storage::IApplicationDataStatics2::GetForUserAsync(); //C4698
```

To disable the warning, add a #pragma:

```cpp
#pragma warning(push)
#pragma warning(disable:4698)

Windows::Storage::IApplicationDataStatics2::GetForUserAsync();

#pragma warning(pop)
```

### Out-of-line definition of a template member function

Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 produces an error when it encounters an out-of-line definition of a template member function that was not declared in the class. The following code now produces error C2039: 'f': is not a member of 'S':

```cpp
struct S {};

template <typename T>
void S::f(T t) {} //C2039: 'f': is not a member of 'S'
```

To fix the error, add a declaration to the class:

```cpp
struct S {
    template <typename T>
    void f(T t);
};
template <typename T>
void S::f(T t) {}
```

### Attempting to take the address of "this" pointer

In C++ `this` is an prvalue of type pointer to X. You cannot take the address of `this` or bind it to an lvalue reference. In previous versions of Visual Studio, the compiler would allow you to circumvent this restriction by performing a cast. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, the compiler produces error C2664.

### Conversion to an inaccessible base class

Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 produces an error when you attempt to convert a type to a base class which is inaccessible. The compiler now raises "error C2243: 'type cast': conversion from 'D *' to 'B *' exists, but is inaccessible". The following code is ill-formed and can potentially cause a crash at runtime. The compiler now produces C2243 when it encounters code like this:

```cpp
#include <memory>

class B { };
class D : B { }; // C2243. should be public B { };

void f()
{
   std::unique_ptr<B>(new D());
}
```

### Default arguments are not allowed on out of line definitions of member functions

Default arguments are not allowed on out-of-line definitions of member functions in template classes The compiler will issue a warning under **/permissive**, and a hard error under **/permissive-**.

In previous versions of Visual Studio, the following ill-formed code could potentially cause a runtime crash. Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 produces warning C5034: 'A\<T>::f': an out-of-line definition of a member of a class template cannot have default arguments:

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct A {
    T f(T t, bool b = false);
};

template <typename T>
T A<T>::f(T t, bool b = false) // C5034
{
    // ...
}
```

To fix the error, remove the `= false` default argument.

### Use of offsetof with compound member designator

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, using `offsetof(T, m)` where *m* is a "compound member designator" results in a warning when you compile with the **/Wall** option. The following code is ill-formed and could potentially cause a crash at runtime. Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 produces "warning C4841: non-standard extension used: compound member designator in offsetof":

```cpp
struct A {
   int arr[10];
};

// warning C4841: non-standard extension used: compound member designator in offsetof
constexpr auto off = offsetof(A, arr[2]);
```

To fix the code, either disable the warning with a pragma or change the code to not use `offsetof`:

```cpp
#pragma warning(push)
#pragma warning(disable: 4841)
constexpr auto off = offsetof(A, arr[2]);
#pragma warning(pop)
```

### Using offsetof with static data member or member function

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, using `offsetof(T, m)` where *m* refers to a static data member or a member function results in an error. The following code produces "error C4597: undefined behavior: offsetof applied to member function 'foo'" and "error C4597: undefined behavior: offsetof applied to static data member 'bar'":

```cpp
#include <cstddef>

struct A {
   int foo() { return 10; }
   static constexpr int bar = 0;
};

constexpr auto off = offsetof(A, foo);
constexpr auto off2 = offsetof(A, bar);
```

This code is ill-formed and could potentially cause a crash at runtime. To fix the error, change the code to no longer invoke undefined behavior. This is non-portable code that is disallowed by the C++ standard.

### <a name="declspec"></a> New warning on declspec attributes

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, the compiler no longer ignores attributes if `__declspec(...)` is applied before `extern "C"` linkage specification. Previously, the compiler would ignore the attribute, which could have runtime implications. When the **/Wall** and **/WX** options are set, the following code produces "warning C4768: __declspec attributes before linkage specification are ignored":

```cpp
__declspec(noinline) extern "C" HRESULT __stdcall //C4768
```

To fix the warning, put extern "C" first:

```cpp
extern "C" __declspec(noinline) HRESULT __stdcall
```

This warning is off by default in 15.3, but on by default in 15.5, and only impacts code compiled with  **/Wall** **/WX**.

### decltype and calls to deleted destructors

In previous versions of Visual Studio, the compiler did not detect when a call to a deleted destructor occurred in the context of the expression associated with 'decltype'. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, the following code produces  "error C2280: 'A\<T>::~A(void)': attempting to reference a deleted function":

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct A
{
   ~A() = delete;
};

template<typename T>
auto f() -> A<T>;

template<typename T>
auto g(T) -> decltype((f<T>()));

void h()
{
   g(42);
}
```

### Uninitialized const variables

Visual Studio 2017 RTW release had a regression in which the C++ compiler would not issue a diagnostic if a 'const' variable was not initialized. This regression has been fixed in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3. The following code now produces "warning C4132: 'Value': const object should be initialized":

```cpp
const int Value; //C4132
```

To fix the error, assign a value to `Value`.

### Empty declarations

Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 now warns on empty declarations for all types, not just built-in types. The following code now produces a level 2 C4091 warning for all four declarations:

```cpp
struct A {};
template <typename> struct B {};
enum C { c1, c2, c3 };

int;    // warning C4091 : '' : ignored on left of 'int' when no variable is declared
A;      // warning C4091 : '' : ignored on left of 'main::A' when no variable is declared
B<int>; // warning C4091 : '' : ignored on left of 'B<int>' when no variable is declared
C;      // warning C4091 : '' : ignored on left of 'C' when no variable is declared
```

To remove the warnings, simply comment-out or remove the empty declarations. In cases where the un-named object is intended to have a side effect (such as RAII) it should be given a name.

The warning is excluded under **/Wv:18** and is on by default under warning level W2.

### std::is_convertible for array types

Previous versions of the compiler gave incorrect results for [std::is_convertible](standard-library/is-convertible-class.md) for array types. This required library writers to special-case the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler when using the `std::is_convertible<...>` type trait. In the following example, the static asserts pass in earlier versions of Visual Studio but fail in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

using Array = char[1];

static_assert(std::is_convertible<Array, Array>::value);
static_assert(std::is_convertible<const Array, const Array>::value, "");
static_assert(std::is_convertible<Array&, Array>::value, "");
static_assert(std::is_convertible<Array, Array&>::value, "");
```

`std::is_convertible<From, To>` is calculated by checking to see if an imaginary function definition is well formed:

```cpp
   To test() { return std::declval<From>(); }
```

### Private destructors and std::is_constructible

Previous versions of the compiler ignored whether a destructor was private when deciding the result of [std::is_constructible](standard-library/is-constructible-class.md). It now considers them. In the following example, the static asserts pass in earlier versions of Visual Studio but fail in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

class PrivateDtor {
   PrivateDtor(int) { }
private:
   ~PrivateDtor() { }
};

// This assertion used to succeed. It now correctly fails.
static_assert(std::is_constructible<PrivateDtor, int>::value);
```

Private destructors cause a type to be non-constructible. `std::is_constructible<T, Args...>` is calculated as if the following declaration were written:

```cpp
   T obj(std::declval<Args>()...)
```

This call implies a destructor call.

### C2668: Ambiguous overload resolution

Previous versions of the compiler sometimes failed to detect ambiguity when it found multiple candidates via both using declarations and argument dependent lookup. This can lead to wrong overload being chosen and unexpected runtime behavior. In the following example, Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 correctly raises C2668 'f': ambiguous call to overloaded function:

```cpp
namespace N {
   template<class T>
   void f(T&, T&);

   template<class T>
   void f();
}

template<class T>
void f(T&, T&);

struct S {};
void f()
{
   using N::f;

   S s1, s2;
   f(s1, s2); // C2668
}
```

To fix the code, remove the using `N::f` statement if you intended to call `::f()`.

### C2660: local function declarations and argument dependent lookup

Local function declarations hide the function declaration in the enclosing scope and disable argument dependent lookup. However, previous versions of the compiler performed argument dependent lookup in this case, potentially leading to the wrong overload being chosen and unexpected runtime behavior. Typically, the error is due to an incorrect signature of the local function declaration. In the following example, Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 correctly raises C2660 'f': function does not take 2 arguments:

```cpp
struct S {};
void f(S, int);

void g()
{
   void f(S); // C2660 'f': function does not take 2 arguments:
   // or void f(S, int);
   S s;
   f(s, 0);
}
```

To fix the problem, either change the `f(S)` signature or remove it.

### C5038: order of initialization in initializer lists

Class members are initialized in the order they are declared, not the order they appear in initializer lists. Previous versions of the compiler did not warn when the order of the initializer list differed from the order of declaration. This could lead to undefined runtime behavior if the intialization of one member depended on another member in the list already being initialized. In the following example, Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 (with **/Wall**) raises "warning C5038: data member 'A::y' will be initialized after data member 'A::x'":

```cpp
struct A
{
    A(int a) : y(a), x(y) {} // Initialized in reverse, y reused
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

To fix the problem, arrange the intializer list to have the same order as the declarations. A similar warning is raised when one or both initializers refer to base class members.

Note that the warning is off-by-default and only affects code compiled with **/Wall**.

## <a name="update_155"></a> Bug fixes and other behavior changes in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5

### Partial Ordering Change

The compiler now correctly rejects the following code and gives the correct error message:

```cpp
template<typename... T>
int f(T* ...)
{
    return 1;
}

template<typename T>
int f(const T&)
{
    return 2;
}

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    f(&i);    // C2668
}
```

```Output
t161.cpp
t161.cpp(16): error C2668: 'f': ambiguous call to overloaded function
t161.cpp(8): note: could be 'int f<int*>(const T &)'
        with
        [
            T=int*
        ]
t161.cpp(2): note: or       'int f<int>(int*)'
t161.cpp(16): note: while trying to match the argument list '(int*)'
```

The problem in the example above is that there are two differences in the types (const vs. non-const and pack vs. non-pack). To eliminate the compiler error, remove one of the differences. This enables the compiler to unambiguously order the functions.

```cpp
template<typename... T>
int f(T* ...)
{
    return 1;
}

template<typename T>
int f(T&)
{
    return 2;
}

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    f(&i);
}
```

### Exception handlers

Handlers of reference to array or function type are never a match for any exception object. The compiler now correctly honors this rule and raises a level 4 warning. It also no longer matches a handler of `char*` or `wchar_t*` to a string literal when **/Zc:strictStrings** is used.

```cpp
int main()
{
    try {
        throw "";
    }
    catch (int (&)[1]) {} // C4843 (This should always be dead code.)
    catch (void (&)()) {} // C4843 (This should always be dead code.)
    catch (char*) {} // This should not be a match under /Zc:strictStrings
}
```

```Output
warning C4843: 'int (&)[1]': An exception handler of reference to array or function type is unreachable, use 'int*' instead
warning C4843: 'void (__cdecl &)(void)': An exception handler of reference to array or function type is unreachable, use 'void (__cdecl*)(void)' instead
```

The following code avoids the error:

```cpp
catch (int (*)[1]) {}
```

### <a name="tr1"></a>std::tr1 namespace is deprecated

The non-Standard `std::tr1` namespace is now marked as deprecated in both C++14 and C++17 modes. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, the following code raises C4996:

```cpp
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    std::tr1::function<int (int, int)> f = std::plus<int>(); //C4996
    cout << f(3, 5) << std::endl;
    f = std::multiplies<int>();
    cout << f(3, 5) << std::endl;
}
```

```Output
warning C4996: 'std::tr1': warning STL4002: The non-Standard std::tr1 namespace and TR1-only machinery are deprecated and will be REMOVED. You can define _SILENCE_TR1_NAMESPACE_DEPRECATION_WARNING to acknowledge that you have received this warning.
```

To fix the error, remove the reference to the `tr1` namespace:

```cpp
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    std::function<int (int, int)> f = std::plus<int>();
    cout << f(3, 5) << std::endl;
    f = std::multiplies<int>();
    cout << f(3, 5) << std::endl;
}
```

### <a name="annex_d"></a>Standard Library features in Annex D are marked as deprecated

When the **/std:c++17** mode compiler switch is set, almost all Standard Library features in Annex D are marked as deprecated.

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, the following code raises C4996:

```cpp
#include <iterator>

class MyIter : public std::iterator<std::random_access_iterator_tag, int> {
public:
    // ... other members ...
};

#include <type_traits>

static_assert(std::is_same<MyIter::pointer, int*>::value, "BOOM");
```

```Output
warning C4996: 'std::iterator<std::random_access_iterator_tag,int,ptrdiff_t,_Ty*,_Ty &>::pointer': warning STL4015: The std::iterator class template (used as a base class to provide typedefs) is deprecated in C++17. (The <iterator> header is NOT deprecated.) The C++ Standard has never required user-defined iterators to derive from std::iterator. To fix this warning, stop deriving from std::iterator and start providing publicly accessible typedefs named iterator_category, value_type, difference_type, pointer, and reference. Note that value_type is required to be non-const, even for constant iterators. You can define _SILENCE_CXX17_ITERATOR_BASE_CLASS_DEPRECATION_WARNING or _SILENCE_ALL_CXX17_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS to acknowledge that you have received this warning.
```

To fix the error, follow the instructions in the warning text, as demonstrated in the following code:

```cpp
#include <iterator>

class MyIter {
public:
    typedef std::random_access_iterator_tag iterator_category;
    typedef int value_type;
    typedef ptrdiff_t difference_type;
    typedef int* pointer;
    typedef int& reference;

    // ... other members ...
};

#include <type_traits>

static_assert(std::is_same<MyIter::pointer, int*>::value, "BOOM");
```

### Unreferenced local variables

In Visual Studio 15.5, warning C4189 is emitted in more cases, as shown in the following code:

```cpp
void f() {
    char s[2] = {0}; // C4189. Either use the variable or remove it.
}
```

```Output
warning C4189: 's': local variable is initialized but not referenced
```

To fix the error, remove the unused variable.

### Single line comments

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, warnings C4001 and C4179 are no longer emitted by the C compiler. Previously, they were only emitted under the **/Za** compiler switch.  The warnings are no longer needed because single line comments have been part of the C standard since C99.

```cpp
/* C only */
#pragma warning(disable:4001) //C4619
#pragma warning(disable:4179)
// single line comment
//* single line comment */
```

```Output
warning C4619: #pragma warning: there is no warning number '4001'
```

If the code does not need to be backwards compatible, you can avoid the warning by removing the C4001/C4179 suppression. If the code does need to be backward compatible, then suppress C4619 only.

```C

/* C only */

#pragma warning(disable:4619)
#pragma warning(disable:4001)
#pragma warning(disable:4179)

// single line comment
/* single line comment */
```

### __declspec attributes with extern "C" linkage

In earlier versions of Visual Studio, the compiler ignored `__declspec(...)` attributes when `__declspec(...)` was applied before the `extern "C"` linkage specification. This behavior caused code to be generated that user didn't intend, with possible runtime implications. The warning was added in Visual Studio version 15.3, but was off by default. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, the warning is enabled by default.

```cpp
__declspec(noinline) extern "C" HRESULT __stdcall //C4768
```

```Output
warning C4768: __declspec attributes before linkage specification are ignored
```

To fix the error, place the linkage specification before the __declspec attribute:

```cpp
extern "C" __declspec(noinline) HRESULT __stdcall
```

This new warning C4768 is given on some Windows SDK headers that were shipped with Visual Studio 2017 15.3 or older (for example: version 10.0.15063.0, also known as RS2 SDK). However, later versions of Windows SDK headers (specifically, ShlObj.h and ShlObj_core.h) have been fixed so that they do not produce this warning. When you see this warning coming from Windows SDK headers, you can take these actions:

1. Switch to the latest Windows SDK that came with Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5 release.

1. Turn off the warning around the #include of the Windows SDK header statement:

```cpp
   #pragma warning (push)
   #pragma warning(disable:4768)
   #include <shlobj.h>
   #pragma warning (pop)
   ```

### <a name="extern_linkage"></a>Extern constexpr linkage

In earlier versions of Visual Studio, the compiler always gave a `constexpr` variable internal linkage even when the variable was marked `extern`. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, a new compiler switch (**/Zc:externConstexpr**) enables correct standards-conforming behavior. Eventually this will become the default.

```cpp
extern constexpr int x = 10;
```

```Output
error LNK2005: "int const x" already defined
```

If a header file contains a variable declared `extern constexpr`, it needs to be marked `__declspec(selectany)` in order to correctly have its duplicate declarations combined:

```cpp
extern constexpr __declspec(selectany) int x = 10;
```

### typeid can't be used on incomplete class type

In earlier versions of Visual Studio, the compiler incorrectly allowed the following code, resulting in potentially incorrect type information. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, the compiler correctly raises an error:

```cpp
#include <typeinfo>

struct S;

void f() { typeid(S); } //C2027 in 15.5
```

```Output
error C2027: use of undefined type 'S'
```

### std::is_convertible target type

`std::is_convertible` requires the target type to be a valid return type. In earlier versions of Visual Studio, the compiler incorrectly allowed abstract types, which might lead to incorrect overload resolution and unintended runtime behavior.  The following code now correctly raises C2338:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

struct B { virtual ~B() = 0; };
struct D : public B { virtual ~D(); };

static_assert(std::is_convertible<D, B>::value, "fail"); // C2338 in 15.5
```

To avoid the error, when using `is_convertible` you should compare pointer types because a non-pointer-type comparison might fail if one type is abstract:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

struct B { virtual ~B() = 0; };
struct D : public B { virtual ~D(); };

static_assert(std::is_convertible<D *, B *>::value, "fail");
```

### <a name="noexcept_removal"></a> Dynamic exception specification removal and noexcept

In C++17, `throw()` is an alias for `noexcept`, `throw(<type list>)` and `throw(...)` are removed, and certain types may include `noexcept`. This can cause source compatibility issues with code that conforms to C++14 or earlier. The **/Zc:noexceptTypes-** switch can be used to revert to the C++14 version of `noexcept` while using C++17 mode in general. This enables you to update your source code to conform to C++17 without having to rewrite all your `throw()` code at the same time.

The compiler also now diagnoses more mismatched exception specifications in declarations in C++17 mode or with **/permissive-** with the new warning C5043.

The following code generates C5043 and C5040 in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5 when the **/std:c++17** switch is applied:

```cpp
void f() throw(); // equivalent to void f() noexcept;
void f() {} // warning C5043
void g() throw(); // warning C5040

struct A {
    virtual void f() throw();
};

struct B : A {
    virtual void f() { } // error C2694
};
```

To remove the errors while still using **/std:c++17**, either add the **/Zc:noexceptTypes-** switch to the command line, or else update your code to use `noexcept`, as shown in the following example:

```cpp
void f() noexcept;
void f() noexcept { }
void g() noexcept(false);

struct A {
    virtual void f() noexcept;
};

struct B : A {
    virtual void f() noexcept { }
};
```

### Inline variables

Static constexpr data members are now implicitly inline, which means that their declaration within a class is now their definition. Using an out-of-line definition for a static constexpr data member is redundant, and now deprecated. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5 when the **/std:c++17** switch is applied, the following code now produces warning C5041 *'size': out-of-line definition for constexpr static data member is not needed and is deprecated in C++17*:

```cpp
struct X {
    static constexpr int size = 3;
};
const int X::size; // C5041
```

### extern "C" __declspec(...) warning C4768 now on by default

The warning was added in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 but was off by default. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5 it is on by default. See [New warning on declspec attributes](#declspec) for more information.

### Defaulted functions and __declspec(nothrow)

The compiler previously allowed defaulted functions to be declared with `__declspec(nothrow)` when the corresponding base/member functions permitted exceptions. This behavior is contrary to the C++ Standard and can cause undefined behavior at runtime. The standard requires such functions to be defined as deleted if there is an exception specification mismatch.  Under **/std:c++17**, the following code raises C2280 *attempting to reference a deleted function. Function was implicitly deleted because the explicit exception specification is incompatible with that of the implicit declaration.*:

```cpp
struct A {
    A& operator=(const A& other) { // No exception specification; this function may throw.
        ...
    }
};

struct B : public A {
    __declspec(nothrow) B& operator=(const B& other) = default;
};

int main()
{
    B b1, b2;
    b2 = b1; // error C2280
}
```

To correct this code, either remove __declspec(nothrow) from the defaulted function, or remove `= default` and provide a definition for the function along with any required exception handling:

```cpp
struct A {
    A& operator=(const A& other) {
        // ...
    }
};

struct B : public A {
    B& operator=(const B& other) = default;
};

int main()
{
    B b1, b2;
    b2 = b1;
}
```

### noexcept and partial specializations

With noexcept in the type system, partial specializations for matching particular "callable" types may fail to compile or choose the primary template due to a missing partial specialization for pointers-to-noexcept-functions.

In such cases, you may need to add additional partial specializations to handle the noexcept function pointers and noexcept pointers to member functions. These overloads are only legal in **/std:c++17** mode. If backwards-compatibility with C++14 must be maintained, and you are writing code that others consume, then you should guard these new overloads inside `#ifdef` directives. If you are working in a self-contained module, then instead of using `#ifdef` guards you can just compile with the **/Zc:noexceptTypes-** switch.

The following code compiles under **/std:c++14** but fails under **/std:c++17** with "error C2027:use of undefined type 'A\<T>'":

```cpp
template <typename T> struct A;

template <>
struct A<void(*)()>
{
    static const bool value = true;
};

template <typename T>
bool g(T t)
{
    return A<T>::value;
}

void f() noexcept {}

int main()
{
    return g(&f) ? 0 : 1; // C2027
}
```

The following code succeeds under **/std:c++17** because the compiler chooses the new partial specialization `A<void (*)() noexcept>`:

```cpp
template <typename T> struct A;

template <>
struct A<void(*)()>
{
    static const bool value = true;
};

template <>
struct A<void(*)() noexcept>
{
    static const bool value = true;
};

template <typename T>
bool g(T t)
{
    return A<T>::value;
}

void f() noexcept {}

int main()
{
    return g(&f) ? 0 : 1; // OK
}
```

## <a name="update_157"></a> Bug fixes and other behavior changes in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7

### C++17 Default argument in the primary class template

This behavior change is a precondition for [Template argument deduction for class templates - P0091R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0091r3.html), which is planned to be fully supported in a later preview of Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7.

Previously, the compiler ignored the default argument in the primary class template.

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct S {
    void f(int = 0);
};

template<typename T>
void S<T>::f(int = 0) {} // Re-definition necessary
```

In **/std:c++17** mode in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7, the default argument is not ignored:

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct S {
    void f(int = 0);
};

template<typename T>
void S<T>::f(int) {} // Default argument is used
```

### Dependent name resolution

This behavior change is a precondition for [Template argument deduction for class templates - P0091R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0091r3.html), which is planned to be fully supported in a later preview of Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7.

In the following example, the compiler in Visual Studio 15.6 and earlier resolves `D::type` to `B<T>::type` in the primary class template.

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct B {
    using type = T;
};

template<typename T>
struct D : B<T*> {
    using type = B<T*>::type;
};
```

Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7, in **/std:c++17** mode, requires the `typename` keyword in the `using` statement in D. Without `typename` the compiler raises warning C4346: *'B<T\*>::type': dependent name is not a type* and error C2061: *syntax error: identifier 'type'*:

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct B {
    using type = T;
};

template<typename T>
struct D : B<T*> {
    using type = typename B<T*>::type;
};
```

### C++17 [[nodiscard]] attribute - warning level increase

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 in **/std:c++17** mode, the warning level of C4834 ("discarding return value of function with 'nodiscard' attribute") is increased from W3 to W1. You can disable the warning with a cast to `void`, or by passing **/wd:4834** to the compiler

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] int f() { return 0; }

int main() {
    f(); // warning: discarding return value
         // of function with 'nodiscard'
}
```

### Variadic template constructor base class initialization list

In previous editions of Visual Studio, a variadic template constructor base class initialization list that was missing template arguments was erroneously allowed without error. In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7, a compiler error is raised.

The following code example in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 raises *error C2614: D\<int>: illegal member initialization: 'B' is not a base or member*

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct B {};

template<typename T>
struct D : B<T>
{

    template<typename ...C>
    D() : B() {} // C2614. Missing template arguments to B.
};

D<int> d;
```

To fix the error, change the B() expression to B\<T>().

### constexpr aggregate initialization

Previous versions of the C++ compiler incorrectly handled constexpr aggregate initialization; it accepted invalid code in which the aggregate-init-list had too many elements, and produced bad codegen for it. The following code is an example of such code:

```cpp
#include <array>
struct X {
    unsigned short a;
    unsigned char b;
};

int main() {
    constexpr std::array<X, 2> xs = {
        { 1, 2 },
        { 3, 4 }
    };
    return 0;
}

```

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 update 3 and later, the previous example now raises *C2078 too many initializers*. The following example shows how to fix the code. When initializing a `std::array` with nested brace-init-lists, give the inner array a braced-list of its own:

```cpp
#include <array>
struct X {
    unsigned short a;
    unsigned char b;
};

int main() {
    constexpr std::array<X, 2> xs = {{ // note double braces
        { 1, 2 },
        { 3, 4 }
    }}; // note double braces
    return 0;
}

```

## <a name="update_158"></a> Bug fixes and behavior changes in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8

The compiler changes in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 all fall under the category of bug fixes and behavior changes, and are listed below:

### typename on unqualified identifiers

In [/permissive-](build/reference/permissive-standards-conformance.md) mode,  spurious `typename` keywords on unqualified identifiers in alias template definitions are no longer accepted by the compiler. The following code now produces C7511 *'T': 'typename' keyword must be followed by a qualified name*:

```cpp
template <typename T>
using  X = typename T;
```

To fix the error, simply change the second line to `using  X = T;`.

### __declspec() on right side of alias template definitions

[__declspec](cpp/declspec.md) is no longer permitted on the right-hand-side of an alias template definition. This was previously accepted by the compiler but was completely ignored, and would never result in a deprecation warning when the alias was used.

The standard C++ attribute [\[\[deprecated\]\]](cpp/attributes.md) may be used instead, and will be respected as of Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6. The following code now produces C2760 *syntax error: unexpected token '__declspec', expected 'type specifier'*:

```cpp
template <typename T>
using X = __declspec(deprecated("msg")) T;
```

To fix the error, change to code to the following (with the attribute placed before the '=' of the alias definition):

```cpp
template <typename T>
using  X [[deprecated("msg")]] = T;
```

### Two-phase name lookup diagnostics

Two-phase name lookup requires that non-dependent names used in template bodies must be visible to the template at definition time. Previously, the Microsoft C++ compiler would leave an unfound name un-looked-up until instantiation times. Now, it requires that non-dependent names are bound in the template body.

One way this can manifest is with lookup into dependent base classes. Previously, the compiler allowed the use of names that are defined in dependent base classes because they would be looked up during instantiation time when all the types are resolved. Now that code it is treated as an error. In these cases you can force the variable to be looked up at instantiation time by qualifying it with the base class type or otherwise making it dependent, for example by adding a `this->` pointer.

In **/permissive-** mode, the following code now raises C3861: *'base_value': identifier not found*:

```cpp
template <class T>
struct Base {
    int base_value = 42;
};

template <class T>
struct S : Base<T> {
    int f() {
        return base_value;
    }
};

```

To fix the error, change the `return` statement to `return this->base_value;`.

**Note:** In the Boost python library, there has been for a long time an MSVC-specific workaround for a template forward declaration in [unwind_type.hpp](https://github.com/boostorg/python/blame/develop/include/boost/python/detail/unwind_type.hpp). Under [/permissive-](build/reference/permissive-standards-conformance.md) mode starting with Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8 (_MSC_VER=1915), the MSVC compiler does argument-dependent name lookup (ADL) correctly and is consistent with other compilers, making this workaround guard unnecessary. In order to avoid this error *C3861: 'unwind_type': identifier not found*, see [PR 229](https://github.com/boostorg/python/pull/229) in the Boostorg repo to update the header file. We have already patched the [vcpkg](vcpkg.md) Boost package, so if you get or upgrade your Boost sources from vcpkg then you do not need to apply the patch separately.

### forward declarations and definitions in namespace std

The C++ standard doesn't allow a user to add forward declarations or definitions into namespace `std`. Adding declarations or definitions to namespace `std` or to a namespace within namespace std now results in undefined behavior.

At some time in the future, Microsoft will move the location where some STL types are defined. When this happens, it will break existing code that adds forward declarations to namespace `std`. A new warning, C4643, helps identify such source issues. The warning is enabled in **/default** mode and is off by default. It will impact programs that are compiled with **/Wall** or **/WX**.

The following code now raises C4643: *Forward declaring 'vector' in namespace std is not permitted by the C++ Standard*.

```cpp
namespace std {
    template<typename T> class vector;
}
```

To fix the error, use an **include** directive rather than a forward declaration:

```cpp
#include <vector>
```

### Constructors that delegate to themselves

The C++ Standard suggests that a compiler should emit a diagnostic when a delegating constructor delegates to itself. The Microsoft C++ compiler in [/std:c++17](build/reference/std-specify-language-standard-version.md) and [/std:c++latest](build/reference/std-specify-language-standard-version.md) modes now raises C7535: *'X::X': delegating constructor calls itself*.

Without this error, the following program will compile but will generate an infinite loop:

```cpp
class X {
public:
    X(int, int);
    X(int v) : X(v){}
};
```

To avoid the infinite loop, delegate to a different constructor:

```cpp
class X {
public:

    X(int, int);
    X(int v) : X(v, 0) {}
};
```

### offsetof with constant expressions

[offsetof](c-runtime-library/reference/offsetof-macro.md) has traditionally been implemented using a macro that requires a [reinterpret_cast](cpp/reinterpret-cast-operator.md). This is illegal in contexts that require a constant expression, but the Microsoft C++ compiler has traditionally allowed it. The offsetof macro that is shipped as part of the STL correctly uses a compiler intrinsic (**__builtin_offsetof**), but many people have used the macro trick to define their own **offsetof**.

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8, the compiler constrains the areas that these reinterpret_casts can appear in the default mode in order to help code conform to standard C++ behavior. Under [/permissive-](build/reference/permissive-standards-conformance.md), the constraints are even stricter. Using the result of an offsetof in places that require constant expressions may result in code that issues warning C4644 *usage of the macro-based offsetof pattern in constant expressions is non-standard; use offsetof defined in the C++ standard library instead* or C2975 *invalid template argument, expected compile-time constant expression*.

The following code raises C4644 in **/default** and **/std:c++17** modes, and C2975 in **/permissive-** mode:

```cpp
struct Data {
    int x;
};

// Common pattern of user-defined offsetof
#define MY_OFFSET(T, m) (unsigned long long)(&(((T*)nullptr)->m))

int main()

{
    switch (0) {
    case MY_OFFSET(Data, x): return 0;
    default: return 1;
    }
}
```

To fix the error, use **offsetof** as defined via \<cstddef>:

```cpp
#include <cstddef>

struct Data {
    int x;
};

int main()
{
    switch (0) {
    case offsetof(Data, x): return 0;
    default: return 1;
    }
}
```

### cv-qualifiers on base classes subject to pack expansion

Previous versions of the Microsoft C++ compiler did not detect that a base-class had cv-qualifiers if it was also subject to pack expansion.

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8, in **/permissive-** mode the following code raises C3770 *'const S': is not a valid base class*:

```cpp
template<typename... T>
class X : public T... { };

class S { };

int main()
{
    X<const S> x;
}
```

### template keyword and nested-name-specifiers

In **/permissive-** mode, the compiler now requires the `template` keyword to precede a template-name when it comes after a nested-name-specifier which is dependent.

The following code in **/permissive-** mode now raises C7510: *'foo': use of dependent template name must be prefixed with 'template'. note: see reference to class template instantiation 'X<T>' being compiled*:

```cpp
template<typename T> struct Base
{
    template<class U> void foo() {}
};

template<typename T>
struct X : Base<T>
{
    void foo()
    {
        Base<T>::foo<int>();
    }
};
```

To fix the error, add the `template` keyword to the `Base<T>::foo<int>();` statement, as shown in the following example:

```cpp
template<typename T> struct Base
{
    template<class U> void foo() {}
};

template<typename T>
struct X : Base<T>
{
    void foo()
    {
        // Add template keyword here:
        Base<T>::template foo<int>();
    }
};
```
