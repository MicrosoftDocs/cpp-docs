# Warning C26829

> Empty optional '*variable*' is unwrapped

## Remarks

Unwrapping empty `std::optional` values is undefined behavior. Such operation is considered a security vulnerability as it can result in a crash, reading uninitialized memory, or other unexpected behavior. This check will attempt to find cases where a `std::optional` is known to be empty and unwrapped. You can also enable [C26830](../code-quality/c26830.md), [C26859](../code-quality/c26859.md), and [C26860](../code-quality/c26860.md) for a stricter analysis.

## Example

```cpp
void f(std::optional<int> maybeEmpty)
{
    std::optional<int> empty;
    std::optional<int> nonEmpty{5};
    *nonEmpty = 42; // No warning
    *empty = 42; // warning: C26829
    if (!maybeEmpty)
        *maybeEmpty = 42; // warning: C26829
}
```

To solve this problem, make sure the code never unwraps an empty optional. Alternatively, use the `value` method and make sure you handle the `std::bad_optional_access` exception.
