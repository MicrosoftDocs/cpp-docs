# Warning C26405

> Do not assign to an `owner<T>` which may be in valid state (r.3)

## Remarks

If an owner pointer already points to a valid memory buffer, it must not be assigned to another value without releasing its current resource first. Such assignment may lead to a resource leak even if the resource address is copied into some raw pointer (because raw pointers shouldn't release resources). For more information, see the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#r3-a-raw-pointer-a-t-is-non-owning).

Code analysis name: `DONT_ASSIGN_TO_VALID`

## Example 1

Overwriting an owner in a loop:

```cpp
gsl::owner<Shape*> shape = nullptr;
while (shape = NextShape()) // C26405
    Process(shape) ? delete shape : 0;
```
