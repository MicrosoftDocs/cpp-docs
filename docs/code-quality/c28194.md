# C28194

> warning C28194: The function was declared as aliasing the value in variable and exited without doing so

This warning indicates that the function prototype for the function being analyzed has a `__drv_isAliased` annotation, which indicates that it will *alias* the specified argument (that is, assign the value in a way that it will survive returning from the function). However, the function does not alias the argument along the path that is indicated by the annotation. Most functions that alias a variable save its value to a global data structure.
