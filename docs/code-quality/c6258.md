# C6258

> warning C6258: using TerminateThread does not allow proper thread clean up.

This warning indicates that a call to TerminateThread has been detected.

TerminateThread is a dangerous function that should only be used in the most extreme cases. For more information about problems associated with TerminateThread call, see [TerminateThread function](/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-terminatethread).

## To properly terminate threads

1. Create an event object using the `CreateEvent` function.

2. Create the threads.

3. Each thread monitors the event state by calling the `WaitForSingleObject` function.

4. Each thread ends its own execution when the event is set to the signaled state (`WaitForSingleObject` returns `WAIT_OBJECT_0`).
