# C26814

> Warning C26814: Use constexpr for constants whose value is known at compile time. (Con.5)
The const variable '%variable%' can be computed at compile time. Consider using constexpr (con.5)

## Example

```cpp
const int foo = 1234;  // C26814 reported here.
constexpr int getMagicNumber()
{
    return 42;
}

void bar()
{
    const int myval = 3; // C26814 reported here
    const int magicNumber = getMagicNumber(); // C26814 reported here.
}
```
