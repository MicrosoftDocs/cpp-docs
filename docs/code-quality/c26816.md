# Warning C26816

> The pointer points to memory allocated on the stack (ES.65)

## Remarks

The pointer points to a variable that is allocated on the stack. When the variable goes out of scope it's cleaned up, which causes the pointer to be invalid.

Code analysis name: `LIFETIME_LOCAL_USE_AFTER_FREE_STACK`

## Example

```cpp
// In this example, std::string is being used internally because the implementer felt it was easier to
// perform the non-trivial initialization of the value but the function returns a C-style string.
const char *danglingRawPtrFromLocal() {
  std::string s;
  
  // interesting string initialization here
  
  return s.c_str(); // Oops, The pointer points to memory allocated on the stack
}
```

The fix is to extend the life of the value that is used.  In this example, we address the warning by returning the std::string.
It could also be addressed by copying the data to the heap or adding an "out" variable to the function parameter list.

```cpp
const char* danglingRawPtrFromLocal() {
  std::string s = "Hello World";
  const char* x = s.c_str();
  // It's now fixed and bypassed this warning(The pointer points to memory allocated on the stack aka C26816)
  
  return x;
}
```
