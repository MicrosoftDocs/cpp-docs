# C6314

> warning C6314: Incorrect order of operations: bitwise-or has higher precedence than the conditional-expression operator. Add parentheses to clarify intent

This message indicates that an expression that contains a bitwise-or operator (`|`) was detected in the tested expression of a conditional operation (`?:`).

The conditional operator has lower precedence than bitwise operators. If the tested expression should contain the bitwise-or operator, then parentheses should be added around the conditional-expression.

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
int SystemState();

int f(int SignalValue)
{
  return SystemState() | (SignalValue != 0) ? 1 : 0;
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
int SystemState();

int f(int SignalValue)
{
  return SystemState() | ((SignalValue != 0) ? 1 : 0);
}
```
