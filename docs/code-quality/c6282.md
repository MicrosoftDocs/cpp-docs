# Warning C6282

> Incorrect operator: assignment of constant in Boolean context. Consider using '==' instead

## Remarks

This warning indicates that an assignment of a constant to a variable was detected in a test context. Assignment of a constant to a variable in a test context is almost always incorrect. Replace the `=` with `==`, or remove the assignment from the test context to resolve this warning.

Code analysis name: `ASSIGNMENTREPLACESTEST`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void f( int i )
{
   while (i = 5)
   {
   // code
   }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void f( int i )
{
   while (i == 5)
   {
   // code
   }
}
```
