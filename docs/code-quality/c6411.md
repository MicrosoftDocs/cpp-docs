# C6411

> warning C6411: Potentially reading invalid data from the buffer.

This warning indicates that the value of the index that is used to read from the buffer can exceed the readable size of the buffer. Because the code analysis tool reports this warning when it cannot reduce a complex expression that represents the buffer size, or the index used to access the buffer, this warning might be reported in error.

## Example

The following code generates this warning.

```cpp
char *a = new char[strlen(InputParam)];
delete[] a;
a[10];
```

The following code corrects this error.

```cpp
int i = strlen(InputParam);
char *a = new char[i];
if (i > 10) a[10];
delete[] a;
```
