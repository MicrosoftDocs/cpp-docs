# Warning C6411

> Potentially reading invalid data from '*buffer*'.

## Remarks

This warning indicates that the value of the index that is used to read from the buffer can exceed the readable size of the buffer. The code analysis tool may report this warning in error. The error may occur when it can't reduce a complex expression that represents the buffer size, or the index used to access the buffer.

Code analysis name: `POTENTIAL_READ_OVERRUN`

## Example

The following code generates this warning.

```cpp
char *a = new char[strlen(InputParam)];
delete[] a;
a[10];
```

The following code corrects this error.

```cpp
int i = strlen(InputParam);
char *a = new char[i];
if (i > 10) a[10];
delete[] a;
```
