# C26116

> warning C26116: Failing to acquire or to hold lock \<lock> in \<func>.

Enforcement of syntactically scoped lock *acquire* and lock *release* pairs in C/C++ programs is not performed by the language. A function may introduce a locking side effect by making an observable modification to the concurrency state. For example, a lock wrapper function increments the number of lock acquisitions, or lock count, for a given lock.You can annotate a function that has a side effect from a lock acquire or lock release by using `_Acquires_lock_` or `_Requires_lock_held`, respectively. Without such annotations, a function is expected not to change any lock count after it returns. If acquires and releases are not balanced, they are considered to be *orphaned*. Warning C26116 is issued when a function has been annotated with `_Acquires_lock_`, but it does not acquire a lock, or when a function is annotated with `_Requires_lock_held` and releases the lock.

## Example

The following example generates warning C26116 because the function `DoesNotLock` was annotated with `_Acquires_lock_` but does not acquire it. The function `DoesNotHoldLock` generates the warning because it is annotated with `_Requires_lock_held` and does not hold it.

```cpp
typedef struct _DATA
{
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;
} DATA;

_Acquires_lock_(p->cs) void DoesLock(DATA* p)
{
    EnterCriticalSection(&p->cs); // OK
}

_Acquires_lock_(p->cs) void DoesNotLock(DATA* p)
{
    // Warning C26116
}

_Requires_lock_held_(p->cs) void DoesNotHoldLock(DATA* p)
{
    LeaveCriticalSection(&p->cs); // Warning C26116
}
```
