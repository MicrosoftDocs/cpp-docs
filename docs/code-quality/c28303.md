# C28303

> warning C28303: For C++ reference-parameter <parameter_name>, an ambiguous `_Deref_` operator was found on \<annotation>.

This warning similar to warning C28302 and is reported when an extra level of `_Deref_` is used on a parameter.

SAL2 does not require the use of an extra level of `_Deref_` when dealing with reference parameters. This particular annotation is ambiguous as to which level of dereference is intended to be annotated. It may be necessary to use `_At_` to reference the specific object to be annotated.

## Example

The following code generates this warning because the use of `__deref_out_ecount(n)` is ambiguous:

```cpp
void ref(__deref_out_ecount(n) int **&buff, int &n)
```

The above annotation could be interpreted either as:

- a reference to an array (of n) pointers to integers (SAL1 interpretation)

- a reference to a pointer to an array (of n) integers (SAL2 interpretation)

  Either of the following can correct this warning:

```cpp
void ref(_Out_writes_(n) int **&buff, int &n)
// or
_At_(*buff), _Out_writes(n)) void ref(int **&buff, int &n)
```
