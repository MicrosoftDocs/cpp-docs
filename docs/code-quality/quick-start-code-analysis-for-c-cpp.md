# Quickstart: Code analysis for C/C++

You can improve the quality of your application by running code analysis regularly on C or C++ code. Code analysis can help you find common problems and violations of good programming practice. And, it finds defects that are difficult to discover through testing. Its warnings differ from compiler errors and warnings: It searches for specific code patterns that are known to cause problems. That is, code that's valid, but could still create issues, either for you or for other people who use your code.

## Configure rule sets for a project

1. In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the project name and then choose **Properties**.

1. Optionally, in the **Configuration** and **Platform** lists, choose the build configuration and target platform.

1. To run code analysis every time the project is built using the selected configuration, select the **Enable Code Analysis on Build** check box. You can also run code analysis manually by opening the **Analyze** menu and then choosing **Run Code Analysis on** *ProjectName* or **Run Code Analysis on File**.

1. Choose the [rule set](using-rule-sets-to-specify-the-cpp-rules-to-run.md) that you want to use or create a [custom rule set](using-rule-sets-to-specify-the-cpp-rules-to-run.md#to-create-a-rule-set-in-a-text-editor). If using LLVM/clang-cl, see [Using Clang-Tidy in Visual Studio](clang-tidy.md) to configure Clang-Tidy analysis options.

To include every rule:

| Rule Set | Description |
|--|--|
| **Microsoft All Rules** | This rule set contains all rules. Running this rule set may result in a large number of warnings being reported. Use this rule set to get a comprehensive picture of all issues in your code. It can help you decide which of the more focused rule sets are most appropriate to run for your projects. |

## Run code analysis

On the **Code Analysis** page of the Project Properties dialog, you can configure code analysis to run each time you build your project. You can also run code analysis manually.

To run code analysis on a solution:

- In the **Build** menu, choose **Run Code Analysis on Solution**.

To run code analysis on a project:

1. In the Solution Explorer, select the name of the project.

1. In the **Build** menu, choose **Run Code Analysis on** *Project Name*.

To run code analysis on a file:

1. In the Solution Explorer, select the name of the file.

1. In the **Build** menu, choose **Run Code Analysis on File** or press **Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F7**.

   The project or solution is compiled and code analysis runs. Results appear in the Error List window.

## Analyze and resolve code analysis warnings

The Error List window lists the code analysis warnings found. The results are displayed in a table. If more information is available about a particular warning, the first column contains an expansion control. Choose it to expand the display for additional information about the issue. When possible, code analysis displays the line numbers and analysis logic that led to the warning.

For detailed information about the warning, including possible solutions to the issue, choose the warning ID in the Code column to display its corresponding online help article.

Double-click a warning to move the cursor to the line of code that caused the warning in the code editor. Or, press Enter on the selected warning.

After you understand the problem, you can resolve it in your code. Then, rerun code analysis to make sure that the warning no longer appears in the Error List.

## Create work items for code analysis warnings

You can use the work item tracking feature to log bugs from within Visual Studio. To use this feature, you must connect to an instance of Azure DevOps Server (formerly, Team Foundation Server).

### To create a work item for one or more C/C++ code warnings

1. In the Error List, expand and select the warnings

1. On the shortcut menu for the warnings, choose **Create Work Item**, and then choose the work item type.

1. Visual Studio creates a single work item for the selected warnings and displays the work item in a document window of the IDE.

1. Add any additional information, and then choose **Save Work Item**.

## Search and filter code analysis results

You can search long lists of warning messages and you can filter warnings in multi-project solutions.

- **To filter warnings by title or warning ID**: Enter the keyword in the Search Error List box.

- **To filter warnings by severity**: By default, code analysis messages are assigned a severity of **Warning**. You can assign the severity of one or more messages as **Error** in a custom rule set. On the **Severity** column of the **Error List**, choose the drop-down arrow and then the filter icon. Choose **Warning** or **Error** to display only the messages that are assigned the respective severity. Choose **Select All** to display all messages.
