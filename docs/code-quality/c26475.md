# Warning C26475

> Do not use function style C-casts.

**C++ Core Guidelines**:
[ES.49](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-casts-named): If you must use a cast, use a named cast

Function-style casts (for example, `int(1.1)`) are another form of C-style casts (like `(int)1.1`), which have questionable safety. Specifically, the compiler doesn't try to check if any data loss can occur either in C-casts or in function casts. In both cases, it's better either to avoid casting or to use a braced initializer if possible. If neither works, static casts may be suitable, but it's still better to use utilities from the Guidelines Support Library:

- `gsl::narrow` ensures lossless conversion and throws `gsl::narrowing_error` if it's not possible.
- `gsl::narrow_cast` clearly states that conversion can lose data and it's acceptable.

## Remarks

- This rule fires only for constants of primitive types. The compiler can clearly detect data loss in these cases and emits an error if a braced initializer is used. The cases that would require run-time execution are flagged by [C26493 NO_CSTYLE_CAST](./c26493.md).

- Default initializers aren't flagged (for example `int()`).

## Example

Dangerous conversion example:

```cpp
constexpr auto planck_constant = float( 6.62607004082e-34 ); // C26475
```

Compiler error for dangerous conversion, detecting potential data loss:

```cpp
constexpr auto planck_constant = float{ 6.62607004082e-34 }; // Error C2397
```

To correct the dangerous conversion, use an appropriately sized primitive type:

```cpp
constexpr auto planck_constant = double{ 6.62607004082e-34 };
```
