# Warning C6302

> Format string mismatch.

## Remarks

This warning indicates that a format string specifies a wide character string, but is being passed a narrow character string instead. One cause of the warning is because the meaning of `%s` and `%S` flip when used with `printf` or `wprintf`. This defect can lead to crashes, in addition to potentially incorrect output.

Code analysis name: `CHAR_WCHAR_ARGUMENT_TO_FORMAT_FUNCTION`

## Example

The following code generates this warning. `buff` is a narrow character string, but `wprintf_s` is the wide string variant of `printf_s` and so expects `%s` to be wide:

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff[5] = "hi";
    wprintf_s(L"%s", buff);
}
```

The following example code remediates this issue by using `%hs` to specify a single-byte character string.  Alternatively it could have switched to `%S`, which is a narrow string when used with `wprintf` like functions. See [Format specification syntax: `printf` and `wprintf` functions](../c-runtime-library/format-specification-syntax-printf-and-wprintf-functions.md#type-field-characters) for more options.

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff[5] = "hi";
    wprintf_s(L"%hs", buff);
}
```
