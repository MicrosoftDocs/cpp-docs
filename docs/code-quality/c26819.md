# Warning C26819

> Unannotated fallthrough between switch labels (es.78).

## Remarks

This check covers implicit fallthrough in switch statements. Implicit fallthrough is when control flow transfers from one switch case directly into a following switch case without the use of the `[[fallthrough]];` statement. This warning is raised when an implicit fallthrough is detected in a switch case containing at least one statement.

For more information, see [ES.78: Don't rely on implicit fallthrough in `switch` statements](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-break) in the C++ Core Guidelines.

## Example

In this sample, implicit fallthrough occurs from a nonempty `switch` `case` into a following `case`.

```cpp
void fn1();
void fn2();

void foo(int a)
{
    switch (a)
    {
        case 0:    // implicit fallthrough from case 0 to case 1 is OK because case 0 is empty
        case 1:
            fn1(); // implicit fallthrough from case 1 into case 2
        case 2:    // Warning C26819.
            fn2();
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}
```

To fix this issue, insert a `[[fallthrough]];` statement where the fallthrough occurs.

```cpp
void fn1();
void fn2();

void foo(int a)
{
    switch (a)
    {
        case 0:
        case 1:
            fn1();
            [[fallthrough]]; // fallthrough is explicit
        case 2:
            fn2();
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}
```

Another way to fix the issue is to remove the implicit fallthrough.

```cpp
void fn1();
void fn2();

void foo(int a)
{
    switch (a)
    {
        case 0:
        case 1:
            fn1();
            break; // case 1 no longer falls through into case 2
        case 2:
            fn2();
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}
```
