# Warning C26100

> Race condition. Variable '*var*' should be protected by lock '*lock*'.

## Remarks

The `_Guarded_by_` annotation in the code specifies the lock to use to guard a shared variable. Warning C26100 is generated when the guard contract is violated.

Code analysis name: `RACE_CONDITION`

## Examples

The following example generates warning C26100 because there's a violation of the `_Guarded_by_` contract.

```cpp
CRITICAL_SECTION gCS;

_Guarded_by_(gCS) int gData;

typedef struct _DATA {
   _Guarded_by_(cs) int data;
   CRITICAL_SECTION cs;
} DATA;

void Safe(DATA* p) {
   EnterCriticalSection(&p->cs);
   p->data = 1; // OK
   LeaveCriticalSection(&p->cs);
   EnterCriticalSection(&gCS);
   gData = 1; // OK
   LeaveCriticalSection(&gCS);
}

void Unsafe(DATA* p) {
   EnterCriticalSection(&p->cs);
   gData = 1; // Warning C26100 (wrong lock)
   LeaveCriticalSection(&p->cs);
}
```

The contract violation occurs because an incorrect lock is used in the function `Unsafe`. In this case, `gCS` is the correct lock to use.

Occasionally a shared variable only has to be guarded for write access but not for read access. In that case, use the `_Write_guarded_by_` annotation, as shown in the following example.

```cpp
CRITICAL_SECTION gCS;

_Guarded_by_(gCS) int gData;

typedef struct _DATA2 {
   _Write_guarded_by_(cs) int data;
   CRITICAL_SECTION cs;
} DATA2;

int Safe2(DATA2* p) {
   // OK: read does not have to be guarded
   int result = p->data;
   return result;
}

void Unsafe2(DATA2* p) {
   EnterCriticalSection(&gCS);
   // Warning C26100 (write has to be guarded by p->cs)
   p->data = 1;
   LeaveCriticalSection(&gCS);
}
```

This example also generates warning C26100 because it uses an incorrect lock in the function `Unsafe2`.
