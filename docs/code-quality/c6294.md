# C6294

> warning C6294: Ill-defined for-loop: initial condition does not satisfy test. Loop body not executed

This warning indicates that a for-loop cannot be executed  because the terminating condition is true. This warning suggests that the programmer's intent is not correctly captured.

## Example

The following sample code generates this warning because MAX_VALUE is 0:

```cpp
#define MAX_VALUE 0
void f()
{
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < MAX_VALUE; i++)
  {
    // code
  }
}
```

The following sample code corrects this warning by changing the value of MAX_VALUE to 25

```cpp
#define MAX_VALUE 25
void f()
{
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < MAX_VALUE; i++)
  {
    // code
  }
}
```
