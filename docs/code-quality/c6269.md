# Warning C6269

> Possible incorrect order of operations: dereference ignored

This warning indicates that the result of a pointer dereference is being ignored, which raises the question of why the pointer is being dereferenced in the first place.

## Remarks

The compiler will correctly optimize away the gratuitous dereference. In some cases, however, this defect may reflect a precedence or logic error.

One common cause for this defect is an expression statement of the form:

```cpp
*p++;
```

If the intent of this statement is simply to increment the pointer `p`, then dereference is unnecessary; however, if the intent is to increment the location that `p` is pointing to, then the program won't behave as intended because `p++` construct is interpreted as `(p++)` instead of `(*p)++`.

Code analysis name: `POINTER_DEREF_DISCARDED`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void f( int *p )
{
  // code ...
  if( p != NULL )
    *p++;
  // code ...
}
```

To correct this warning, use parentheses as shown in the following code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void f( int *p )
{
  // code ...
  if( p != NULL )
    (*p)++;
  // code ...
}
```
