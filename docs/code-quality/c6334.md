# C6334

> warning C6334: sizeof operator applied to an expression with an operator may yield unexpected results

This warning indicates a misuse of the **`sizeof`** operator. The **`sizeof`** operator, when applied to an expression, yields the size of the type of the resulting expression.

For example, in the following code:

```cpp
char     a[10];
size_t   x;

x = sizeof (a - 1);
```

 `x` will be assigned the value 4, not 9, because the resulting expression is no longer a pointer to the array `a`, but simply a pointer.

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void f( )
{
  size_t x;
  char a[10];

  x= sizeof (a - 4);
  // code...
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void f( )
{
  size_t x;
  char a[10];

  x= sizeof (a) - 4;
  // code...
}
```
