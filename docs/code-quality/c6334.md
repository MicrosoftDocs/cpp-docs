# Warning C6334

> `sizeof` operator applied to an expression with an operator may yield unexpected results

## Remarks

The `sizeof` operator, when applied to an expression, yields the size of the type of the resulting expression.

Code analysis name: `SIZEOFEXPR`

## Example

The following code generates this warning. Since `a - 4` is an expression, `sizeof` will return the size of the resulting pointer, not the size of the structure found at that pointer:

```cpp
void f( )
{
    size_t x;
    char a[100];
    x = sizeof(a - 4);
    assert(x == 96);  //assert fails since x == sizeof(char*)
}
```

To correct this warning, ensure that you're working with the return value of `sizeof`, not the argument to it:

```cpp
void f( )
{
    size_t x;
    char a[100];
    x = sizeof(a) - 4;
    assert(x == 96);  //assert succeeds
}
```
