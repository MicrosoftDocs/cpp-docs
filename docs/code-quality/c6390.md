# Warning C6390

> According to the C++ standard, the value of 'this' is never null; some compilers will optimize this check out

## Remarks

While MSVC doesn't do such optimizations, some compilers optimize null checks for `this` out. Code that relies on null-valued `this` can trigger unexpected behavior when compiled with other compilers. This warning helps detect these portability problems.

Code analysis name: `NO_NULLCHECK_FOR_THIS`

## Example

```cpp
struct X
{
    void m()
    {
        if(!this) // Warning: According to the C++ standard, the value of 'this' is never null; some compilers will optimize this check out
          return;
    }
};
```

To solve this problem, rewrite the code to never call non-static member functions on null pointers.
