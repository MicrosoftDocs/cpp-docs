# Warning C6225

> Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: assigning 1 or `TRUE` to `HRESULT`. Consider using `S_FALSE` instead

## Remarks

This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is being assigned or initialized with a value of an explicit 1. Boolean types indicate success by a non-zero value; success (`S_OK`) in `HRESULT` is indicated by a value of 0.

This warning is frequently caused by accidental confusion of Boolean and `HRESULT` types. To indicate success, the symbolic constant `S_OK` should be used.

Code analysis name: `ASSIGNING_ONE_TO_HRESULT`

## Example

In the following code, assignment of `HRESULT` generates warning C6225:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

VOID f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  if (SUCCEEDED(CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc)))
  {
    hr = S_OK;
  }
  else
  {
    hr = 1;
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
VOID f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  if (SUCCEEDED(CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc)))
  {
    hr = S_OK;
  }
  else
  {
    hr = S_FALSE;
  }
}
```

For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.

To indicate failure, `E_FAIL`, or another constant, should be used.

To make use of modern C++ memory allocation methodology, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Library (STL). These include [`shared_ptr`](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [`unique_ptr`](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and containers such as [`vector`](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).
