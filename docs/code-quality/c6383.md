# Warning C6383

> Buffer overrun due to conversion of an element count into a byte count: an element count is expected for parameter `*parameter_name*` in call to `*function_name*`

This warning indicates that a non-constant byte count is being passed when an element count is instead required.

## Remarks

Typically, this warning occurs when a variable is multiplied by the `sizeof` a type. This issue will likely result in more bytes being copied to the buffer than it can hold.

Code analysis name: `ELEMENTS_TO_BYTES`

## Example

The following code generates this warning. `wcsncpy` will allow `n * sizeof(wchar_t)` characters to be copied, but the buffer can only hold `n` characters. It should be noted that `wcsncpy` is an unsafe function, and shouldn't be used per [C28719](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/28719-banned-api-usage-use-updated-function-replacement). The unsafe variant is used here only for the purposes of demonstrating this warning:

```cpp
void f(wchar_t* t, wchar_t* s, int n)
{
    wcsncpy (t, s, n*sizeof(wchar_t));
}
```

The following code corrects this warning by sending element count instead of the byte count:

```cpp
void f( wchar_t* t, wchar_t* s, int n )
{
    wcsncpy (t, s, n);
}
```
