# Warning C26451

> Arithmetic overflow: Using operator '*operator*' on a *size-a* byte value and then casting the result to a *size-b* byte value. Cast the value to the wider type before calling operator '*operator*' to avoid overflow (io.2)

This warning indicates incorrect behavior that results from integral promotion rules and types larger than the ones in which arithmetic is typically performed.

## Remarks

Code analysis detects when an integral value gets shifted left, multiplied, added, or subtracted, and the result gets cast to a wider integral type. If the operation overflows the narrower integral type, then data is lost. You can prevent this loss by casting the value to a wider type before the arithmetic operation.

Code analysis name: `RESULT_OF_ARITHMETIC_OPERATION_CAST_TO_LARGER_SIZE`

## Examples

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void leftshift(int i) noexcept
{
  unsigned long long x;
  x = i << 31;  // C26451 reported here

  // code
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void leftshift(int i) noexcept
{
  unsigned long long x;
  x = static_cast<unsigned long long>(i) << 31; // OK

  // code
}
```
