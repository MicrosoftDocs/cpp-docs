# Warning C6993

> Code analysis ignores OpenMP constructs; analyzing single-threaded code

## Remarks

This warning indicates that the static analysis tools don't support Open MP pragmas. The static analysis tools could generate incorrect results because they assume the code is single-threaded, not multi-threaded.

Your code doesn't necessarily need to be 'fixed' to resolve this diagnostic because this warning indicates what the toolset supports and not an issue with your code.
