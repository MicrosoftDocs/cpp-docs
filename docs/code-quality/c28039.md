# Warning C28039

> The type of actual parameter '*operand*' should exactly match the type '*typename*'

This warning is reported when an `enum` formal wasn't passed a member of the `enum`, but may also be used for other types.

Because C permits `enum` types to be used interchangeably, and interchangeably with constants, it's easy to pass the wrong `enum` value to a function without an error.

For `enum` types, if the type of an `enum` parameter is annotated with `_Enum_is_bitflag_`, arithmetic is permitted on the parameter. Otherwise the parameter must be of exactly the correct type. If a constant is strictly required, warning C28137 may also apply.

This rule can be used for other parameter types as well; see the function documentation for why the types must match exactly.
