# Warning C6280

> '*variable-name*' is allocated with '*function-name-1*', but deleted with '*function-name-2*'

This warning indicates that the calling function has inconsistently allocated memory by using a function from one family and freed it by using a function from another.

## Remarks

The analyzer checks for this condition only when the `_Analysis_mode_(_Analysis_local_leak_checks_)` SAL annotation is specified. By default, this annotation is specified for Windows kernel mode (driver) code. For more information about SAL annotations, see [Using SAL Annotations to Reduce C/C++ Code Defects](../code-quality/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-cpp-code-defects.md).

For example, this warning would be produced if memory is allocated by using `malloc` but freed by using `GlobalFree` or `delete`. In the specific cases of mismatches between array `new[]` and scalar `delete`, more precise warnings are reported instead of this one.

Code analysis name: `MEMORY_ALLOCATION_MISMATCH`

## Example

The following sample code generates this warning. `pInt` is allocated using `calloc` but is freed using the mismatched function `delete`:

```cpp
// C6280a_warning.cpp
// cl.exe /analyze /c /EHsc /nologo /W4
#include <sal.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

_Analysis_mode_(_Analysis_local_leak_checks_)

void f(int arraySize)
{
    int *pInt = (int *)calloc(arraySize, sizeof (int));
    // code ...
    delete pInt;
}
```

The following code avoids this warning by using the deallocation function `free`, the match to `calloc`:

```cpp
// C6280a_no_warning.cpp
// cl.exe /analyze /c /EHsc /nologo /W4
#include <sal.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

_Analysis_mode_(_Analysis_local_leak_checks_)

void f(int arraySize)
{
    int *pInt = (int *)calloc(arraySize, sizeof (int));
    // code ...
    free(pInt);
}
```

Different API definitions can use different heaps. For example, `GlobalAlloc` uses the system heap, and `free` uses the process heap. This issue is likely to cause memory corruptions and crashes.

These inconsistencies apply to the `new`/`delete` and `malloc`/`free` memory allocation mechanisms. To avoid these kinds of potential inconsistencies altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Library (STL). These include [`shared_ptr`](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [`unique_ptr`](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and containers such as [`vector`](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).

The following code avoids this problem entirely by using `unique_ptr`:

```cpp
// C6280b_no_warning.cpp
// cl.exe /analyze /c /EHsc /nologo /W4
#include <sal.h>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>

using namespace std;

_Analysis_mode_(_Analysis_local_leak_checks_)

void f(int arraySize)
{
    // use unique_ptr instead of calloc/malloc/new
    unique_ptr<int[]> pInt(new int[arraySize]);

    // code ...

    // No need for free because unique_ptr
    // cleans up when out of scope.
}
```
