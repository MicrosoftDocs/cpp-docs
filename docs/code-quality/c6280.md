# C6280

> warning C6280: \<variable> is allocated with \<function>, but deleted with \<function>

This warning indicates that the calling function has inconsistently allocated memory by using a function from one memory allocation family and freed it by using a function from another memory allocation family. The analyzer checks for this condition only when the `_Analysis_mode_(_Analysis_local_leak_checks_)` SAL annotation is specified. By default, this annotation is specified for Windows kernel mode (driver) code. For more information about SAL annotations, see [Using SAL Annotations to Reduce C/C++ Code Defects](../code-quality/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-cpp-code-defects.md).

For example, this warning would be produced if memory is allocated by using `malloc` but freed by using `GlobalFree` or **`delete`**. In the specific cases of mismatches between array `new[]` and scalar **`delete`**, more precise warnings are reported instead of this one.

## Example

The following sample code generates this warning.

```cpp
// cl.exe /analyze /c /EHsc /nologo /W4
#include <sal.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

_Analysis_mode_(_Analysis_local_leak_checks_)

void f(int arraySize)
{
    int *pInt = (int *)calloc(arraySize, sizeof (int));
    // code ...
    delete pInt;
}
```

To correct this warning, use this code:

```cpp
// cl.exe /analyze /c /EHsc /nologo /W4
#include <sal.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

_Analysis_mode_(_Analysis_local_leak_checks_)

void f(int arraySize)
{
    int *pInt = (int *)calloc(arraySize, sizeof (int));
    // code ...
    free(pInt);
}
```

Different API definitions can use different heaps. For example, `GlobalAlloc` uses the system heap, and `free` uses the process heap. This is likely to cause memory corruptions and crashes.

These inconsistencies apply to the **`new`**/**`delete`** and `malloc`/`free` memory allocation mechanisms. To avoid these kinds of potential inconsistencies altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). These include [shared_ptr](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [unique_ptr](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and [vector](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart Pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).

```cpp
// cl.exe /analyze /c /EHsc /nologo /W4
#include <sal.h>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>

using namespace std;

_Analysis_mode_(_Analysis_local_leak_checks_)

void f(int arraySize)
{
    // use unique_ptr instead of calloc/malloc/new
    unique_ptr<int[]> pInt(new int[arraySize]);

    // code ...

    // No need for free because unique_ptr
    // cleans up when out of scope.
}
```
