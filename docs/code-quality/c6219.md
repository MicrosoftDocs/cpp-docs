# C6219

> warning C6219: Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: comparing HRESULT to 1 or TRUE. Consider using [SUCCEEDED](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-succeeded) or [FAILED](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed) macro instead

This warning indicates an `HRESULT` is being compared with an explicit, non-`HRESULT` value of one (1). This comparison is likely to lead to incorrect results, because the typical success value of `HRESULT` (`S_OK`) is 0. If you compare this value to a Boolean type it's implicitly converted to false.

## Example

The following code generates this warning because the `CoGetMalloc` returns an `HRESULT`, which then is compared to `TRUE`:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;
  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);

  if (hr == TRUE)
  {
    // success code ...
  }
  else
  {
    // failure code
  }
}
```

Most of the time, this warning is caused by code that compares an `HRESULT` to a Boolean. It's better to use the `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` macros to test the value of an `HRESULT`. To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;
  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);

  if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
  {
    // success code ...
  }
  else
  {
    // failure code
  }
}
```

For this warning, the `SCODE` type is treated as an `HRESULT`.

The use of `malloc` and `free` (and related dynamic memory APIs) has many pitfalls as a cause of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of leaks and exception problems, use the pointer and container classes provided by the C++ Standard Library. These include [shared_ptr](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [unique_ptr](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and [vector](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart Pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).
