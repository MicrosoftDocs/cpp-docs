# Warning C6398

> The address-of a field cannot be `null` in well-defined code

## Remarks

The address-of operator returns the address of its operand. This value should never be compared to `nullptr`:
* The address-of a field can only be `nullptr` if the base pointer was `nullptr` and the field is at the zero offset (`&p->field == nullptr` implies `p == nullptr`). In this case, the expression should be simplified.
* In any other cases, the value of the unary `&` operator can't be `nullptr` unless there's undefined behavior in the code (`&v == nullptr` always evaluates to false).

## Example

The following example generates C6398:

```cpp
struct A { int* x; };

bool hasNullField(A *a)
{  
    return &a->x == nullptr; // C6398 reported here.
}
```

To fix this issue, double check if the use of unary `&` was intentional:

```cpp
struct A { int* x; };

bool hasNullField(A *a)
{  
    return a->x == nullptr; // no C6398 reported here.
}
```
