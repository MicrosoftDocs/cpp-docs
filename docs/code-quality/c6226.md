# Warning C6226

> Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: assigning -1 to HRESULT. Consider using E_FAIL instead.

This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is assigned or initialized to an explicit value of -1.

## Remarks

This warning is frequently caused by accidental confusion of integer and `HRESULT` types. To indicate success, use the symbolic constant `S_OK` instead. To indicate failure, use the symbolic constants that start with E_*constant*, such as `E_FAIL`.

For more information, see the [`SUCCEEDED`](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-succeeded) and [`FAILED`](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed) macros.

Code analysis name: `ASSIGNING_MINUS_ONE_TO_HRESULT`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

VOID f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  if (FAILED(CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc)))
  {
    hr = -1;
    // code ...
  }
  else
  {
    // code ...
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

VOID f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  if (FAILED(CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc)))
  {
    hr = E_FAIL;
    // code ...
  }
  else
  {
    // code ...
  }
}
```

For this warning, the `SCODE` type is treated as an `HRESULT`.

The use of `malloc` and `free` (and related dynamic memory APIs) has many pitfalls as a cause of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of leaks and exception problems, use the pointer and container classes provided by the C++ Standard Library. These include [shared_ptr](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [unique_ptr](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and [vector](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart Pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).
