# Code analysis for C/C++ warnings

This section lists C/C++ Code Analysis warnings except those that are raised by the [C++ Core Guidelines Checkers](code-analysis-for-cpp-corecheck.md). For information about Code Analysis, see [`/analyze` (Code Analysis)](../build/reference/analyze-code-analysis.md) and [Quick Start: Code Analysis for C/C++](../code-quality/quick-start-code-analysis-for-c-cpp.md).
