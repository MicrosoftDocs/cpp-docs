# Warning C26130

> Missing annotation \_Requires\_lock\_held\_('*lock*') or \_No\_competing\_thread\_ at function '*func*'. Otherwise it could be a race condition. Variable '*var*' should be protected by lock '*lock*'.

## Remarks

Warning C26130 is issued when the analyzer detects a potential race condition but infers that the function is likely to be run in a single threaded mode. For example, when the function is in the initialization stage, based on certain heuristics.

## Examples

In the following example, warning C26130 is generated because a `_Guarded_by_` member is being modified without a lock.

```cpp
typedef struct _DATA
{
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;
    _Guarded_by_(cs) int data;
} DATA;

void Init(DATA* p)
{
    p->data = 0; // Warning C26130
}
```

If the previous code is guaranteed to operate in single-threaded mode, annotate the function by using `_No_competing_thread_`, as shown in the following example.

```cpp
typedef struct _DATA
{
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;
    _Guarded_by_(cs) int data;
} DATA;

_No_competing_thread_ void Init(DATA* p)
{
    p->data = 0; // Warning C26130 will be resolved
}
```

Alternatively, you can annotate a code fragment by using `_No_competing_thread_begin_` and `_No_competing_thread_end_`, as follows.

```cpp
typedef struct _DATA
{
    CRITICAL_SECTION cs;
    _Guarded_by_(cs) int data;
} DATA;

void Init(DATA* p)
{
    _No_competing_thread_begin_
    p->data = 0; // Warning C26130 will be resolved
    _No_competing_thread_end_
}
```
