# C28022

> warning C28022: The function class(es) \<classlist1> on this function do not match the function class(es) \<classlist2> on the typedef used to define it.

This warning is reported when there is an error in the annotations. Both the typedef and the function itself have `_Function_class_` annotations, but they do not match. If both are used they must match.
