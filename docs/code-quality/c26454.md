# Warning C26454

> Arithmetic overflow: '*operator*' operation produces a negative unsigned result at compile time

## Remarks

This warning indicates that the subtraction operation produces a negative result that was evaluated in an unsigned context, which can result in unintended overflows.

Code analysis name: `RESULT_OF_ARITHMETIC_OPERATION_NEGATIVE_UNSIGNED`

## Example

```cpp
unsigned int negativeunsigned()
{
    const unsigned int x = 1u - 2u; // C26454 reported here
    return x;
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
unsigned int negativeunsigned()
{
    const unsigned int x = 4294967295; // OK
    return x;
}
```
