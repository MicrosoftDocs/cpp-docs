# Warning C33001

> VARIANT '*var*' was cleared when it was uninitialized (expression '*expr*')

## Remarks

This warning is triggered when an uninitialized `VARIANT` is passed to an API, such as `VariantClear`, that clears the object. Initialize the `VARIANT` before passing it to these functions so it can be properly cleared.

This warning applies to these functions:

* `VariantClear`
* `PropVariantClear`
* `VariantCopy`
* `VariantCopyInd`
* `VariantChangeType`
* `VariantChangeTypeEx`
* `DestroyPropVariant`

Code analysis name: `VARIANTCLEAR_UNINITIALIZED`

## Example

The following code causes warning C33001:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

HRESULT foo(bool some_condition)
{
    VARIANT var;

    if (some_condition)
    {
        //...
        VariantInit(&var);
        //...
    }

    VariantClear(&var);  // C33001
}
```

In this example, the warning is corrected by calling `VariantClear` only after `var` has been initialized:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

HRESULT foo(bool some_condition)
{
    VARIANT var;

    if (some_condition)
    {
        //...
        VariantInit(&var);
        //...
        VariantClear(&var);  // OK
    }
}
```
