# C26455 DEFAULT_CTOR_NOEXCEPT

The C++ Core Guidelines suggest that default constructors shouldn't do anything that can throw. If the default constructor is allowed to throw, operations such as move and swap will also throw which is undesirable because move and swap should always succeed. Parameterized constructors may throw.

## Remarks

Consider the default constructors of the STL types, like `std::vector`. In these implementations, the default constructors initialize internal state without making allocations. In the `std::vector` case, the size is set to 0 and the internal pointer is set to `nullptr`. The same pattern should be followed for all default constructors.
