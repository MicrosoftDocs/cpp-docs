# Warning C26455

> Default constructor should not throw. Declare it '`noexcept`' (f.6)

The C++ Core Guidelines suggest that default constructors shouldn't do anything that can throw. When the default constructor can throw, all code that relies on a properly instantiated object may also throw.

## Remarks

Consider the default constructors of the STL types, like `std::vector`. In these implementations, the default constructors initialize internal state without making allocations. In the `std::vector` case, the size is set to 0 and the internal pointer is set to `nullptr`. The same pattern should be followed for all default constructors.

Code analysis name: `DEFAULT_CTOR_NOEXCEPT`
