# Warning C26132

> Variable '*variable name*' should be protected by '*lock 1*', but '*lock 2*' is held instead. Possible annotation mismatch.

The analyzer issues Warning C26132 when it detects that a lock, which is annotated to protect a value, isn't held while accessing the value. However, a related lock is held. The code may be thread-safe, so you might need to update the annotations.

This diagnostic usually doesn't indicate a bug in the code, but rather a mismatch between the annotations and the actual locking behavior. If so, the diagnostic should be resolved as there may be other static analysis issues that aren't being reported due to the inconsistent annotations.

## Examples

In the following example, C26132 is emitted when `data` is used.

 The annotation specifies that `customLock01` should protect the variable `data`, but `CustomLockAcquire` is responsible for acquiring the related lock `customLock01->cs`.

```cpp
#include <sal.h>
struct CustomLock 
{
    int cs; // "Critical Section" lock
};

_Acquires_exclusive_lock_(criticalSection->cs) // notice the `->` indirection
void CustomLockAcquire(CustomLock* criticalSection);

_Releases_lock_(criticalSection->cs) // notice the `->` indirection
void CustomLockRelease(CustomLock* criticalSection);

// global lock
CustomLock customLock01;

void Initialize(_Guarded_by_(customLock01) int* data)
{
    CustomLockAcquire(&customLock01);
    *data = 1; // C26132
    CustomLockRelease(&customLock01);
}
```

In this example, the `Initialize` function is thread-safe and behaves as designed, but that design isn't correctly reflected in the concurrency SAL annotations. Fix by adjusting the annotations on the custom locking functions to use `criticalSection` rather than `criticalSection->cs`. The warning could also be fixed by changing the `_Guarded_by_` annotation from `customLock01` to `customLock01.cs`.

```cpp
#include <sal.h>
struct CustomLock 
{
    int cs; // "Critical Section" lock
};

_Acquires_exclusive_lock_(criticalSection)
void CustomLockAcquire(CustomLock* criticalSection);

_Releases_lock_(criticalSection)
void CustomLockRelease(CustomLock* criticalSection);

// global lock
CustomLock customLock01;

void Initialize(_Guarded_by_(customLock01) int* data)
{
    CustomLockAcquire(&customLock01);
    *data = 1;
    CustomLockRelease(&customLock01);
}
```
