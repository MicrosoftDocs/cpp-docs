# Warning C6317

> Incorrect operator: logical-not (!) is not interchangeable with ones-complement (~)

## Remarks

This warning indicates that a logical-not (`!`) is being applied to a constant that is likely to be a bit-flag. The result of logical-not is Boolean; it's incorrect to apply the bitwise-and (`&`) operator to a Boolean value. Use the ones-complement (`~`) operator to flip flags.

Code analysis name: `NOTNOTCOMPLEMENT`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#define FLAGS   0x4004

void f(int i)
{
  if (i & !FLAGS) // warning
  {
    // code
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#define FLAGS   0x4004

void f(int i)
{
  if (i & ~FLAGS)
  {
    // code
  }
}
```
