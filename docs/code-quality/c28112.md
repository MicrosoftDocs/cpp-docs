# Warning C28112

> A variable (*parameter-name*) which is accessed via an Interlocked function must always be accessed via an Interlocked function. See line *line-number*: It is not always safe to access a variable which is accessed via the Interlocked\* family of functions in any other way.

A variable that is accessed by using the Interlocked executive support routines, such as InterlockedCompareExchangeAcquire, is later accessed by using a different function.

## Remarks

`InterlockedXxx` functions are intended to provide atomic operations, but are only atomic with respect to other `InterlockedXxx` functions. Although certain ordinary assignments, accesses, and comparisons to variables that are used by the Interlocked\* routines can be safely accessed by using a different function, the risk is great enough to justify examining each instance.

Code analysis name: INTERLOCKED_ACCESS

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
inter_var--;
//code
InterlockedIncrement(&inter_var);
```

The following code corrects this warning by strictly accessing `inter_var` through `InterlockedXxx` functions:

```cpp
InterlockedDecrement(&inter_var);
//code
InterlockedIncrement(&inter_var);
```
