# Warning C6221

> Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: comparing HRESULT to an integer. Consider using `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` macros instead

This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is being compared to an integer other than zero.

## Remarks

A success in an `HRESULT` (`S_OK`) is represented by a 0. Therefore, an implicit cast of an `HRESULT` to an integer generates an incorrect value and is likely to lead to the wrong result. The error is often caused by mistakenly expecting a function to return an integer when it actually returns an `HRESULT`.

Code analysis name: `COMPARING_HRESULT_TO_INT`

## Example

The following code generates warning C6221 by comparing an `HRESULT` against an integer value:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

HRESULT f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);
  if (hr == 4)
  {
    // failure code ...
    return S_FALSE;
  }
  else
  {
    // success code ...
    return S_OK;
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, the following code uses the `FAILED` macro:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

HRESULT f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);
  if (FAILED(hr))
  {
    // failure code ...
    return S_FALSE;
  }
  else
  {
    // success code ...
    return S_OK;
  }
}
```

For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.

For more information, see [`SUCCEEDED` Macro](/windows/win32/api/winerror/nf-winerror-succeeded) and [`FAILED` Macro](/windows/win32/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed).

The use of `malloc` and `free` (and related dynamic memory allocation APIs) has many pitfalls in terms of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of potential leaks altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Library (STL). These include [`shared_ptr`](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [`unique_ptr`](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and containers such as [`vector`](../standard-library/vector.md).
