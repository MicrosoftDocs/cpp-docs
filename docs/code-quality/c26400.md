# C26400 NO_RAW_POINTER_ASSIGNMENT

This check helps to enforce the *rule I.11: Never transfer ownership by a raw pointer (T\*)*, which is a subset of the rule *R.3: A raw pointer (a T\*) is non-owning.* Specifically, it warns on any call to operator `new` which saves its result in a variable of raw pointer type. It also warns on calls to functions that return `gsl::owner<T>` if their results are assigned to raw pointers. The idea here is that you should clearly state ownership of memory resources. For more information, see the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#r-resource-management).

The easiest way to fix this is to use `auto` declaration if the resource is assigned immediately at the variable declaration. If this is not possible, then we suggest that you use the type `gsl::owner<T>`. The `auto` declarations initialized with operator `new` are "owners" because we assume that the result of any allocation is implicitly an owner pointer. We transfer this assumption to the `auto` variable and treat it as `owner<T>`.

If this check flags a call to a function which returns `owner<T>`, this may be an indication of a legitimate bug in code. Basically, it points to a place where the code leaks an explicit notion of ownership (and maybe the resource itself).

## Remarks

This rule currently checks only local variables. If allocation is assigned to a formal parameter, global variable, class member, and so on, it is not flagged. Appropriate coverage of such scenarios is a part of future work.

## Example 1: Simple allocation

```cpp
char *buffer = nullptr;
if (useCache)
    buffer = GetCache();
else
    buffer = new char[bufferSize];  // C26400
```

## Example 2: Simple allocation (fixed with gsl::owner\<T>)

```cpp
gsl::owner<char*> buffer = nullptr;
if (useCache)
    buffer = GetCache();
else
    buffer = new char[bufferSize];  // OK

Example 3: Simple allocation (fixed with auto)
auto buffer = useCache ? GetCache() : new char[bufferSize]; // OK
```
