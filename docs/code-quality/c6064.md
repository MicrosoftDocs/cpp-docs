# Warning C6064

> Missing integer argument to '*function-name*' corresponding to conversion specifier '*number*'

This warning indicates that the code doesn't provide enough arguments to match a format string and one of the missing arguments is an integer.

## Remarks

This defect is likely to cause incorrect output and, in more dangerous cases, can lead to stack overflow.

Code analysis name: `MISSING_INTEGER_ARGUMENT_TO_FORMAT_FUNCTION`

## Example

The following code generates this warning because it uses an incorrect number of arguments in the call to `sprintf_s` and the missing argument is an integer. If the unsafe function `sprintf` was used instead of the safer variant `sprintf_s`, this code would likely cause a stack overflow instead of just an unexpected output:

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff[8];
    const char *string="Hello";
    sprintf_s(buff, sizeof(buff), "%s %d", string);  // Attempts to print "Hello "
    // followed by a number up to eleven characters long, depending on the garbage
    // found on the stack. Any number other than a single non-negative digit can't
    // fit in the 8 char buffer and leave room for the trailing null. If sprintf 
    // had been used instead, it would overflow.
}
```

To correct this warning, specify missing arguments or adjust the format string. In this example, we add the missing integer value.

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff[8];
    const char *string = "Hello";
    sprintf_s(buff, sizeof(buff), "%s %d", string, strlen(string));
}
```
