# Warning C6064

> Missing integer argument to '*function-name*' corresponding to conversion specifier '*number*'

This warning indicates that the code doesn't provide enough arguments to match a format string and one of the missing arguments is an integer.

## Remarks

Supplying too few arguments to a format function leads to undefined behavior because the function attempts to read values that aren't passed. Possible consequences include incorrect output, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities such as information leaks.

To ensure stability and safety, always match the number and types of arguments to the format specifiers in the string.

Code analysis name: `MISSING_INTEGER_ARGUMENT_TO_FORMAT_FUNCTION`

## Example

The following code generates this warning by passing the wrong number of arguments to `sprintf_s` and the missing argument is an integer. If the unsafe function `sprintf` was used instead of the safer variant `sprintf_s`, this code would likely cause a stack overflow instead of just unexpected output:

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff[8];
    const char *string="Hello";
    sprintf_s(buff, sizeof(buff), "%s %d", string);  // Attempts to print "Hello "
    // followed by a number up to eleven characters long, depending on the garbage
    // found on the stack. Any number other than a single non-negative digit can't
    // fit in the 8 char buffer and leave room for the trailing null. If sprintf 
    // had been used instead, it would overflow.
}
```

To correct this warning, specify the missing arguments or adjust the format string. In this example, we add the missing integer value.

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff[8];
    const char *string = "Hello";
    sprintf_s(buff, sizeof(buff), "%s %d", string, strlen(string));
}
```
