# Warning C6279

> '*variable-name*' is allocated with scalar new, deleted with array delete []

This warning appears only in C++ code and indicates that the calling function has inconsistently allocated memory with the scalar `new` operator, but freed it with the array `delete[]` operator. If memory is allocated with scalar `new`, it should typically be freed with scalar `delete`.

## Remarks

The exact ramifications of this defect are difficult to predict. It might cause random behavior or crashes due to usage of uninitialized memory as constructors aren't invoked. Or, it might cause memory allocations and crashes in situations where operators have been overridden. The analysis tool doesn't currently distinguish between these situations.

To avoid these kinds of allocation problems altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Library (STL). These include [`shared_ptr`](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [`unique_ptr`](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and containers such as [`vector`](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).

Code analysis name: `NEW_ARRAY_DELETE_MISMATCH`

## Example

The following code generates warning C6279. `A` is allocated using `new` but deleted using `delete[]`:

```cpp
class A
{
  // members
};

void f()
{
   A *pA = new A;
   //code ...
   delete[] pA;
}
```

The following code avoids this warning by using `delete` instead:

```cpp
class A
{
  // members
};

void f()
{
   A *pA = new A;
   //code ...
   delete pA;
}
```
