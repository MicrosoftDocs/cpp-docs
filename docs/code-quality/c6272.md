# C6272

> warning C6272: non-float passed as argument \<number> when float is required in call to \<function>

This warning indicates that the format string specifies that a float is required, for example, a `%f` or `%g` specification for `printf,` but a non-float such as an integer or string is being passed. This defect is likely to result in incorrect output; however, in certain circumstances it could result in a crash.

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void f()
{
   char buff[5];
   int i=5;

   sprintf(buff,"%s %f","a",i);
}
```

To correct this warning, use `%i` instead of `%f` specification as shown in the following code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void f()
{
   char buff[5];
   int i=5;

   sprintf(buff,"%s %i","a",i);
}
```

The following code uses the safe string manipulation function, `sprintf_s`, to correct this warning:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void f()
{
   char buff[5];
   int i=5;

   sprintf_s(buff,5,"%s %i","a",i); // safe version
}
```
