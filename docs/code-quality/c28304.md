# C28304

> warning C28304: For C++ reference-parameter <parameter_name>, an improperly placed `_Notref_` operator was found applied to \<token>.

The `_Notref_` operator should only be used in special circumstances involving C++ reference parameters and only in system-provided macros. It must be immediately followed by a `_Deref_` operator or a functional annotation.
