# C6386

> warning C6386: buffer overrun: accessing \<buffer name>, the writable size is \<size1> bytes, but \<size2> bytes may be written: Lines: x, y

This warning indicates that the writable extent of the specified buffer might be smaller than the index used to write to it. This can cause buffer overrun.

## Example

The following code generates both this warning and [C6201](../code-quality/c6201.md):

```cpp
#define MAX 25

void f ( )
{
  char ar[MAX];
  // code ...
  ar[MAX] = '\0';
}
```

To correct both warnings, use the following code:

```cpp
#define MAX 25

void f ( )
{
   char a[MAX];
   // code ...
   a[MAX - 1] = '\0';
}
```
