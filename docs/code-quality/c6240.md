# Warning C6240

> ('*expression*' && '*non-zero constant*') always evaluates to the result of '*expression*'. Did you intend to use the bitwise-and operator?

This warning indicates that a non-zero constant value, other than one, was detected on the right side of a logical-and operation that occurs in a test context. For example, the  expression `(n && 3)` reduces to `(!!n)`, which is the Boolean value of `n`.

## Remarks

This warning typically indicates an attempt to check a bit mask in which the bitwise-AND (`&`) operator should be used. It isn't generated if the non-zero constant evaluates to 1 because of its use for selectively choosing code paths.

Code analysis name: `LOGICALANDNONZERO`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#define INPUT_TYPE 2

void f(int n)
{
   if (n && INPUT_TYPE)
   {
      puts("boolean value of !!n is true");
   }
   else
   {
      puts("boolean value of !!n is false");
   }
}
```

To correct this warning, use bitwise-AND operator as shown in the following code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#define INPUT_TYPE 2

void f(int n)
{
   if ( (n & INPUT_TYPE) )
   {
      puts("bitmask true");
   }
   else
   {
      puts("bitmak false");
   }
}
```
