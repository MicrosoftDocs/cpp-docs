# Warning C6385

> Invalid data: accessing *buffer-name*, the readable size is *size1* bytes, but *size2* bytes may be read: Lines: *x*, *y*

## Remarks

The readable extent of the buffer might be smaller than the index used to read from it. Attempts to read data outside the valid range leads to buffer overrun.

Code analysis name: `READ_OVERRUN`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void f(unsigned int i)
{
   char a[20];
   char j;
   if (i <= 20)  // C6385
   {
      j = a[i];
   }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void f(unsigned int i)
{
   char a[20];
   char j;
   if (i < 20)  // Okay
   {
      j = a[i];
   }
}
```
