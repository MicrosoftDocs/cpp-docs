# Warning C26465

> Don't use `const_cast` to cast away `const`. `const_cast` is not required; constness or volatility is not being removed by this conversion.

## See also

[C++ Core Guidelines Type.3](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Pro-type-constcast)

## Example

```cpp
void function(int* const constPtrToInt)
{
  auto p = const_cast<int*>(constPtrToInt); // C26465, const is not being removed
}
```
