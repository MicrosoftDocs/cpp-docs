# Warning C6319

> Use of the comma-operator in a tested expression causes the left argument to be ignored when it has no side-effects

## Remarks

This warning indicates an ignored sub-expression in test context because of the comma-operator (**`,`**). The comma operator has left-to-right associativity. The result of the comma-operator is the last expression evaluated. If the left expression to comma-operator has no side effects, the compiler might omit code generation for the expression.

Code analysis name: `IGNOREDBYCOMMA`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void f()
{
  int i;
  int x[10];

  for ( i = 0; x[i] != 0, x[i] < 42; i++)  // warning
  {
    // code
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the logical AND operator as shown in the following code:

```cpp
void f()
{
  int i;
  int x[10];

  for ( i = 0; (x[i] != 0) && (x[i] < 42); i++)
  {
    // code
  }
}
```
