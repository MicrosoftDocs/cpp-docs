# Warning C6318

> Ill-defined `__try`/`__except`: use of the constant EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH or another constant that evaluates to zero in the exception-filter expression. The code in the exception handler block is not executed

## Remarks

This warning indicates that if an exception occurs in the protected block of this structured exception handler, the exception won't be handled because the constant `EXCECPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH` is used in the exception filter expression.

This code is equivalent to the protected block without the exception handler block because the handler block isn't executed.

Code analysis name: `EXCEPTIONCONTINUESEARCH`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <excpt.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void f (char *pch)
{
  __try
  {
    // assignment might fail
    *pch = 0;
  }
  __except (EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH) // warning C6318
  {
    puts("Exception Occurred");
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#include <excpt.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>

void f (char *pch)
{
  __try
  {
    // assignment might fail
    *pch = 0;
  }
  __except( (GetExceptionCode() == EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION) ?
                EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER : EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH )
  {
    puts("Access violation");
  }
}
```
