# C26402 DONT_HEAP_ALLOCATE_MOVABLE_RESULT

To avoid confusion about whether a pointer owns an object, a function that returns a movable object should allocate it on the stack and return it by value instead of returning a heap-allocated object. If pointer semantics are required, then return a smart pointer instead of a raw pointer. See [C++ Core Guidelines R.3](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rr-ptr): *Warn if a function returns an object that was allocated within the function but has a move constructor. Suggest considering returning it by value instead.*
