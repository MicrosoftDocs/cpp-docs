# C26433 OVERRIDE_EXPLICITLY

Function should be marked with `override`

## C++ Core Guidelines

[C.128: Virtual functions should specify exactly one of virtual, override, or final](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md)

It is not required by compiler to clearly state that a virtual function overrides its base. Not specifying ‘override’ can cause subtle issues during maintenance if the virtual specification ever changes in the class hierarchy. This also decreases readability and makes interface’s polymorphic behavior less obvious. If function is clearly marked as ‘override’, it enables compiler to check consistency of the interface and help to spot issues before they manifest themselves at run time.

## Notes

1. This rule is not applicable to destructors. Destructors have their own specifics regarding virtuality.
1. The rule doesn’t flag functions explicitly marked as ‘final’, which is itself a special kind of virtual specifier.
1. Warnings show up on function definitions, not declarations. This may be confusing since definitions do not have virtual specifiers, but the warning is still legit.

## Example:  Implicit overriding

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void Draw() = 0;
    // ...
};

class Ellipse : public Shape {
public:
    void Draw() { // C26433
        //...
    }
};
```
