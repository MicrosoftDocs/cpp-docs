# Warning C6412

> Potential buffer overrun while writing to buffer. The writable size is *write_size* bytes, but *write_index* bytes may be written.

## Remarks

This warning indicates that the value of the index that's used to write to the buffer can exceed the writeable size of the buffer.

The code analysis tool may report this warning in error. It reports this warning when it can't reduce a complex expression that represents the buffer size, or the index used to access the buffer.

Code analysis name: `POTENTIAL_WRITE_OVERRUN`

## Example

The following code generates this warning.

```cpp
char *a = new char[strlen(InputParam)];
a[10] = 1;
delete[] a;
```

The following code corrects this error.

```cpp
int i = strlen(InputParam);
char *a = new char[i];
if (i > 10) a[10] = 1;
delete[] a;
```
