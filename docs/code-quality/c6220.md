# Warning C6220

> Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: comparing HRESULT to -1. Consider using `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` macro instead

This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is being compared with an explicit, non-`HRESULT` value of -1, which isn't a well-formed `HRESULT`.

## Remarks

A failure in `HRESULT` (`E_FAIL`) isn't represented by a -1. Therefore, an implicit cast of an `HRESULT` to an integer will generate an incorrect value and is likely to lead to the wrong result.

Code analysis name: `COMPARING_HRESULT_TO_MINUS_ONE`

## Example

In most cases, warning C6220 is caused by code that mistakenly expects a function to return an integer, and to use -1 as a failure value, but instead the function returns an `HRESULT`. The following code sample generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

HRESULT f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);
  if (hr == -1)
  {
    // failure code ...
    return E_FAIL;
  }
  else
  {
    // success code ...
    return S_OK;
  }
}
```

It's best to use the `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` macro to test the value of an `HRESULT`. To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

HRESULT f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);
  if (FAILED(hr))
  {
    // failure code ...
    return E_FAIL;
  }
  else
  {
    // success code ...
    return S_OK;
  }
}
```

For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.

Explicit comparison is appropriate to check for specific `HRESULT` values, such as, `E_FAIL`. Otherwise, use the `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` macros.

For more information, see [`SUCCEEDED` Macro](/windows/win32/api/winerror/nf-winerror-succeeded) and [`FAILED` Macro](/windows/win32/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed).

The use of `malloc` and `free` (and related dynamic memory allocation APIs) has many pitfalls in terms of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of potential leaks altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Library (STL). These include [`shared_ptr`](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [`unique_ptr`](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and containers such as [`vector`](../standard-library/vector.md).
