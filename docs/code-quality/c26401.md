# C26401 DONT_DELETE_NON_OWNER

This check detects places where moving to `owner<T>` can be a good option for the first stage of refactoring. Like C26400, it enforces rules I.11 and R.3, but focuses on the "release" portion of the pointer lifetime. It warns on any call to operator **`delete`** if its target isn't an `owner<T>` or an implicitly assumed owner. For more information about **`auto`** declarations, see [C26400](c26400.md). This check includes expressions that refer to global variables, formal parameters, and so on.

Warnings C26400 and C26401 always occur with [C26409](c26409.md), but they're more appropriate for scenarios where immediate migration to smart pointers isn't feasible. In such cases, the `owner<T>` concept can be adopted first, and C26409 may be temporarily suppressed.

[C++ Core Guidelines I.11](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#i11-never-transfer-ownership-by-a-raw-pointer-t-or-reference-t)

## Examples

```cpp
struct myStruct {};

myStruct* createMyStruct();
void function()
{
    myStruct* pMyStruct = createMyStruct();
    // ...
    delete pMyStruct; // C26401. Do not delete a raw pointer that is not an owner<T>
}
```

See that C26401 is removed if ownership of the pointer is indicated by gsl::owner.

```cpp
#include <gsl/pointers>
struct myStruct {};

gsl::owner<myStruct*> createMyStruct();
void function()
{
    gsl::owner<myStruct*> pMyStruct = createMyStruct();
    // ...
    delete pMyStruct; // no warning.
}
```

There's a C++ idiom, `delete this`, that triggers this warning. The warning is intentional, because the C++ Core Guidelines discourage this pattern. You can suppress the warning by using the `gsl::suppress` attribute, as shown in this example:

```cpp
class MyReferenceCountingObject final
{
public:
    void AddRef();
    void Release() noexcept
    {
        ref_count_--;
        if (ref_count_ == 0)
        {
            [[gsl::suppress(i.11)]]
            delete this; 
        }
    }
private:
    unsigned int ref_count_{1};
};
```
