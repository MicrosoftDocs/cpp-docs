# Warning C26440

> Function can be declared 'noexcept'.

[**C++ Core Guidelines** F.6](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#f6-if-your-function-may-not-throw-declare-it-noexcept): If your function may not throw, declare it `noexcept`

If code isn't supposed to cause any exceptions, it should be marked by using the `noexcept` specifier. This annotation helps to simplify error handling on the client code side, and enables the compiler to do more optimizations.

## Remarks

- A function is considered non-throwing if:
  - it has no explicit `throw` statements;
  - function calls in its body, if any, invoke only functions that are unlikely to throw: `constexpr` or functions marked with any exception specification that entails non-throwing behavior (including some non-standard specifications).
- Non-standard and outdated specifiers like `throw()` or `__declspec(nothrow)` aren't equivalent to `noexcept`.
- Explicit specifiers `noexcept(false)` and `noexcept(true)` are respected appropriately.
- Functions marked as `constexpr` aren't supposed to cause exceptions and aren't analyzed.
- The rule also applies to lambda expressions.
- The logic doesn't consider recursive calls as potentially non-throwing. This logic may change in the future.

## Example

All functions except the destructor will warn because they're missing noexcept.

```cpp
struct S
{
    S() {} // C26455, Default constructor may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept'
    ~S() {}

    S(S&& s) {/*impl*/} // C26439, This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept' (f.6)
    S& operator=(S&& s) {/*impl*/} // C26439, This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept' (f.6)

    S(const S& s) {/*impl*/} // C26440, This function can be declared 'noexcept'
    S& operator=(const S& s) {/*impl*/} // C26440, This function can be declared 'noexcept'
};
```

With noexcept decorating the same structure, all warnings are removed.

```cpp
struct S
{
    S() noexcept {}
    ~S() {}

    S(S&& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
    S& operator=(S&& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}

    S(const S& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
    S& operator=(const S& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
};
```
