# Warning C6305

> Potential mismatch between sizeof and countof quantities

## Remarks

This warning indicates that a variable holding a **`sizeof`** result is being added to or subtracted from a pointer or `countof` expression. This operation will cause unexpected scaling in pointer arithmetic.

Code analysis name: `SIZEOF_COUNTOF_MISMATCH`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void f(int *p)
{
  int cb=sizeof(int);
  //code...
  p +=cb; // warning C6305
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void f(int *p)
{
  // code...
  p += 1;
}
```
