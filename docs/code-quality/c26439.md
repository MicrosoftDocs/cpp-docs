# Warning C26439

> This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept'.

[**C++ Core Guidelines** F.6](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#f6-if-your-function-may-not-throw-declare-it-noexcept): If your function may not throw, declare it noexcept

Some kinds of operations should never cause exceptions. Their implementations should be reliable and should handle possible errors conditions gracefully. They should never use exceptions to indicate failure. This rule flags cases where such operations aren't explicitly marked as `noexcept`, which means that they may throw exceptions and can't convey assumptions about their reliability.

## Remarks

- Special kinds of operations:
  - destructors;
  - default constructors;
  - move constructors and move assignment operators;
  - standard functions with move semantics: `std::move` and `std::swap`.

- Non-standard and outdated specifiers like `throw()` or `declspec(nothrow)` aren't equivalent to `noexcept`.

- Explicit specifiers `noexcept(false)` and `noexcept(true)` are respected appropriately.

- The warning may still appear for operations that are marked as `constexpr`. This check may change in future releases.

## Example

All functions except the destructor will warn because they're missing noexcept.

```cpp
struct S
{
    S() {} // C26455, Default constructor may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept'
    ~S() {}

    S(S&& s) {/*impl*/} // C26439, This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept' (f.6)
    S& operator=(S&& s) {/*impl*/} // C26439, This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept' (f.6)

    S(const S& s) {/*impl*/} // C26440, This function can be declared 'noexcept'
    S& operator=(const S& s) {/*impl*/} // C26440, This function can be declared 'noexcept'
};
```

With noexcept decorating the same structure, all warnings are removed.

```cpp
struct S
{
    S() noexcept {}
    ~S() {}

    S(S&& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
    S& operator=(S&& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}

    S(const S& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
    S& operator=(const S& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
};
```
