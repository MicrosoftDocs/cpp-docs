# Warning C26439

> This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept'.

[F.6: If your function must not throw, declare it `noexcept`](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rf-noexcept)

Some operations should never throw exceptions. Their implementations should be reliable and should handle possible errors conditions gracefully. They shouldn't use exceptions to indicate failure. This rule flags cases where such operations aren't explicitly marked as `noexcept`, which means that they may throw exceptions and consumers can't make assumptions about its reliability.

It's important for these functions to be reliable as they're often used as building blocks to implement functions with [exception safety guarantees](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/exceptions). A move constructor that throws will force Standard Template Library (STL) containers to fall back to copy operations, reducing runtime performance.

Code analysis name: `SPECIAL_NOEXCEPT`

## Remarks

- Special kinds of operations:
  - destructors;
  - move constructors and move assignment operators;
  - standard functions with move semantics: `std::move` and `std::swap`.

- Nonstandard and outdated specifiers like `throw()` or `declspec(nothrow)` aren't equivalent to `noexcept`.

- Explicit specifiers `noexcept(false)` and `noexcept(true)` are respected appropriately.

## Example

The tool warns on all functions except the destructor because they're missing `noexcept`.

```cpp
struct S
{
    ~S() {}

    S(S&& s) {/*impl*/} // C26439, This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept' (f.6)
    S& operator=(S&& s) {/*impl*/} // C26439, This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept' (f.6)

    S(const S& s) {/*impl*/} // C26440, This function can be declared 'noexcept'
    S& operator=(const S& s) {/*impl*/} // C26440, This function can be declared 'noexcept'
};
```

With `noexcept` decorating the same structure, all warnings are removed.

```cpp
struct S
{
    ~S() {}

    S(S&& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
    S& operator=(S&& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}

    S(const S& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
    S& operator=(const S& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
};
```
