# C26404  DONT_DELETE_INVALID

Once owner pointer releases or transfers its resource, it gets into an "invalid" state.
Deleting such a pointer may lead to immediate memory corruption due to double delete, or to an access violation when the deleted resource is accessed from another owner pointer.

## Example 1: Deleting an owner after transferring its value

```cpp
gsl::owner<State*> validState = nullptr;
gsl::owner<State*> state = ReadState();
validState = state;
if (!IsValid(state))
    delete state;   // C26404
```

## Example 2: Deleting an uninitialized owner

```cpp
gsl::owner<Message*> message;
if (popLast)
    message = ReleaseMessage();
delete message; // C26404
```
