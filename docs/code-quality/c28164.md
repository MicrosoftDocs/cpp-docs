# C28164

> warning C28164: The argument is being passed to a function that expects a pointer to an object (not a pointer to a pointer)

This warning is reported when a pointer to a pointer is used in a call to a function that is expecting a pointer to an object.

The function takes a `PVOID` in this position. Usually, this indicates that `&pXXX` was used when `pXXX` is required.

Some *polymorphic functions* (functions that can evaluate to, and be applied to, values of different types) are implemented in C by using a `PVOID` argument that takes any pointer type. However, this allows the programmer to code a pointer to a pointer without causing a compiler error, even when this type is not appropriate.

## Example

The following code example generates this warning:

```cpp
PFAST_MUTEX pFm;
//...
KeWaitForSingleObject(&pFm, UserRequest, UserMode, false, NULL);
```

The following code example avoids the warning:

```cpp
PFAST_MUTEX pFm;
//...
KeWaitForSingleObject(pFm, UserRequest, UserMode, false, NULL);
```
