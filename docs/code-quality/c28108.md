# C28108

> warning C28108: Variable holds an unexpected resource

The resource that the driver is using is in the expected C language type, but has a different semantic type.

## Example

The following code example generates this warning:

```cpp
KeAcquireInStackSpinLock(spinLock, lockHandle);
//...
KeReleaseSpinLock(spinLock, 0);
```

The following code example avoids this warning:

```cpp
KeAcquireInStackSpinLock(spinLock, lockHandle);
//...
KeReleaseInStackSpinLock(lockHandle);
```
