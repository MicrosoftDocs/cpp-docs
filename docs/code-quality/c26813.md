# C26813

> Warning C26813: Use 'bitwise and' to check if a flag is set

Most `enum`s with power of two member values are intended to be used with bit flags. As a result, we rarely want to equality compare these flags. We want to extract the bits we are interested in using bitwise operations instead.

## Example

```cpp
enum BitWise
{
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = 4
};

void useEqualsWithBitwiseEnum(BitWise a) 
{
    if (a == B) // Warning C26813: Use 'bitwise and' to check if a flag is set
        return;
}
```

To fix the warning, use bitwise operations:

```cpp
void useEqualsWithBitwiseEnum(BitWise a) 
{
    if (a & B) // Fixed.
        return;
}
```
