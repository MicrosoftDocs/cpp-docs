# Warning C26813

> Use 'bitwise and' to check if a flag is set

## Remarks

Most `enum` types with power of two member values are intended to be used as bit flags. As a result, you rarely want to compare these flags for equality. Instead, extract the bits you're interested in by using bitwise operations.

Code analysis name: `USE_BITWISE_AND_TO_CHEK_ENUM_FLAGS`

## Example

```cpp
enum BitWise
{
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = 4
};

void useEqualsWithBitwiseEnum(BitWise a) 
{
    if (a == B) // Warning C26813: Use 'bitwise and' to check if a flag is set
        return;
}
```

To fix the warning, use bitwise operations:

```cpp
void useEqualsWithBitwiseEnum(BitWise a) 
{
    if (a & B) // Fixed.
        return;
}
```
