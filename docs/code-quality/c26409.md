# C26409 NO_NEW_DELETE

Even if code is clean of calls to malloc() and free() we still suggest that you consider better options than explicit use of operators [new and delete](/cpp/cpp/new-and-delete-operators).

  **C++ Core Guidelines**:
[R.11: Avoid calling new and delete explicitly](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#r11-avoid-calling-new-and-delete-explicitly)

The ultimate fix is to start using smart pointers with appropriate factory functions, such as [std::make_unique](/cpp/standard-library/memory-functions#make_unique).

## Remarks

- The checker warns on calls to any kind of operator `new` or `delete`: scalar, vector, overloaded versions (global and class-specific), as well as on placement versions. The latter case may require some clarifications on the Core Guidelines in terms of suggested fixes and may be omitted in the future.
