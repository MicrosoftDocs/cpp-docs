# Warning C6260

> `sizeof` * `sizeof` is almost always wrong, did you intend to use a character count or a byte count?

This warning indicates that the results of two **`sizeof`** operations have been multiplied together.

## Remarks

The C/C++ **`sizeof`** operator returns the number of bytes of storage an object uses. It's typically incorrect to multiply it by another **`sizeof`** operation. Usually, you're interested in the number of bytes in an object or the number of elements in an array (for example, the number of wide-characters in an array).

There's some unintuitive behavior associated with **`sizeof`** operator. For example, in C, `sizeof ('\0') == 4`, because a character is of an integral type. In C++, the type of a character literal is **`char`**, so `sizeof ('\0') == 1`. However, in both C and C++, the following relation is true:

```cpp
sizeof ("\0") == 2
```

Code analysis name: `USEOFBYTEAREA`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void f( )
{
  int i;
  i = sizeof (L"String") * sizeof (WCHAR);
  // code ...
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void f( )
{
  // use divide to calculate how many WCHAR characters are in the string
  int i = sizeof (L"String") / sizeof (WCHAR);

  // get the number of bytes in the character array
  int j = sizeof (L"String");

  // code ...
}
```
