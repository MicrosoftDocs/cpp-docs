# Warning C28311

> The <annotation_name> annotation on '*function*' '*parameter*' is an obsolescent version of SAL.

The annotation is an old version and should be updated to the equivalent [SAL2](../code-quality/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-cpp-code-defects.md). This warning isn't emitted if a prior inconsistent annotation warning has been emitted, and is reported only once per declaration. Inspect the rest of the declaration for more obsolete SAL.
