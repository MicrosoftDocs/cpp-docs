# C6063

> warning C6063: missing string argument to \<function> corresponding to conversion specifier \<number>

This warning indicates that not enough arguments are being provided to match a format string; at least one of the missing arguments is a string. This defect can cause crashes and buffer overflows (if the called function is of the `sprintf` family), as well as potentially incorrect output.

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <string.h>
void f( )
{
  char buff[15];
  sprintf(buff, "%s %s", "Hello, World!");
}
```

To correct this warning, provide additional arguments as shown in the following code:

```cpp
#include <string.h>
void f( )
{
  char buff[15];
  sprintf(buff, "%s %s ", "Hello","World");
}
```

The following code corrects this warning using safe string manipulation function:

```cpp
#include <string.h>
void f( )
{
  char buff[15];
  sprintf_s( buff, sizeof(buff),"%s", "Hello, World!" );
}
```
