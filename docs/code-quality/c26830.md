# Warning C26830

> Potentially empty optional '*variable*' is unwrapped

## Remarks

Unwrapping empty `std::optional` values is undefined behavior. Such operation is considered a security vulnerability as it can result in a crash, reading uninitialized memory, or other unexpected behavior. This check will attempt to find cases where a `std::optional` isn't checked for emptiness before unwrap operations. You can enable [C26829](../code-quality/c26829.md) only for a more permissive analysis.

## Example

```cpp
std::optional<int> getOptional();

void f(std::optional<int> maybeEmpty)
{
    if (maybeEmpty)
        *maybeEmpty = 42; // No warning
    *maybeEmpty = 5; // warning: C26830
    std::optional<int> o = getOptional();
    *o = 42; // warning: C26830
}
```

To solve this problem, make sure the code never unwraps an empty optional. Alternatively, use the `value` method and make sure you handle the `std::bad_optional_access` exception.
