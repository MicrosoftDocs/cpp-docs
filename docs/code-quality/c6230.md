# C6230

> warning C6230: implicit cast between semantically different integer types: using HRESULT in a Boolean context

This warning indicates that a bare `HRESULT` is used in a context where a Boolean result is expected, such as an **`if`** statement. This test is likely to yield incorrect results. For example, the typical success value for `HRESULT` (`S_OK`) is false when it's tested as a Boolean.

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

VOID f( )
{
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;
  HRESULT hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);

  if (hr)
  {
    // code ...
  }
  else
  {
    // code ...
  }
}
```

In most situations, the [SUCCEEDED](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-succeeded) or [FAILED](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed) macro should be used to test the value of the `HRESULT`. To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

VOID f( )
{
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;
  HRESULT hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);

  if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
  {
    // code ...
  }
  else
  {
    // code ...
  }
}
```

For this warning, the `SCODE` type is treated as an `HRESULT`.

The use of `malloc` and `free` (and related dynamic memory APIs) has many pitfalls as a cause of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of leaks and exception problems, use the pointer and container classes provided by the C++ Standard Library. These include [shared_ptr](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [unique_ptr](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and [vector](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart Pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).
