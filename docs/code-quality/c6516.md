# C6516

> warning C6516: invalid annotation: no properties specified for \<name> attribute

> [!NOTE]
> This warning occurs only in code that is using a deprecated version of the source-code annotation language (SAL). We recommend that you port your code to use the latest version of SAL. For more information, see [Using SAL Annotations to Reduce C/C++ Code Defects](../code-quality/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-cpp-code-defects.md).

This warning indicates that either no property was specified in the attribute or the property that was specified is invalid; therefore, the attribute cannot be considered complete.

## Example

The following code generates this warning because Deref=1 only specifies the level of indirection, but this information alone does not help the analysis tool:

```cpp
// C
#include <CodeAnalysis\SourceAnnotations.h>
void f([SA_Pre(Deref=1)] char* pc);

// C++
#include <CodeAnalysis\SourceAnnotations.h>
using namespace vc_attributes;
void f([Pre(Deref=1)] char* pc);
```

To correct this warning, another property, such as Access, is required to indicate to the analysis tool what must be enforced on the de-referenced items. The following code corrects this warning:

```cpp
// C
#include <CodeAnalysis\SourceAnnotations.h>
void f([SA_Pre(Deref=1, Access=SA_Read)] char* pc);

// C++
#include <CodeAnalysis\SourceAnnotations.h>
using namespace vc_attributes;
void f([Pre(Deref=1, Access=Read)] char* pc);
```
