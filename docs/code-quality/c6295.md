# C6295

> warning C6295: Ill-defined for-loop: \<variable> values are of the range "min" to "max". Loop executed indefinitely

This warning indicates that a for-loop might not function as intended. The for-loop tests an unsigned value against zero (0) with >=. The result is always true, therefore the loop is infinite.

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void f( )
{
  for (unsigned int i = 100; i >= 0; i--)
  {
    // code ...
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void f( )
{
   for (unsigned int i = 100; i > 0; i--)
   {
      // code ...
   }
}
```
