# C6518

> warning C6518: Invalid annotation: 'SAL_writableTo' property may not be specified as a precondition on buffers that are not writable: '\_Param\_(1)'

This warning indicates that a conflict exists between a `SAL_writableTo` property value and a writable property. This ordinarily indicates that a writable property does not have write access to the parameter being annotated.

## Example

The following code generates this warning because the `_Out_` annotation compiles to include a `SAL_writableTo` property, which does not allow write access:

```cpp
#include <sal.h>
void f(_Out_ const char* pc)
{
    //code that can't write to *pc ...
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#include <sal.h>
void f(_Out_  char* pc)
{
    pc = "Hello World";
    //code ...
}
```
