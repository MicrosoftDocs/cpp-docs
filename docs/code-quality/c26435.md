# Warning C26435

> The virtual function '*symbol*' should specify exactly one of 'virtual', 'override', or 'final' (c.128)

## C++ Core Guidelines

[C.128: Virtual functions should specify exactly one of virtual, override, or final](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rh-override)

To improve readability, the kind of virtual behavior should be stated clearly and without unnecessary redundancy. Even though multiple virtual specifiers can be used simultaneously, it's better to specify one at a time to emphasize the most important aspect of virtual behavior. The following order of importance is apparent:

- plain virtual function;
- virtual function that explicitly overrides its base;
- virtual function that overrides its base and provides the final implementation in the current inheritance chain.

## Notes

- This rule skips destructors since they have special rules regarding virtuality.
- Warnings show up on function definitions, not declarations. It may be confusing, since definitions don't have virtual specifiers, but the warning is still appropriate.

Code analysis name: `SINGLE_VIRTUAL_SPECIFICATION`

## Example: Redundant specifier

```cpp
class Ellipse : public Shape {
public:
    void Draw() override {
        //...
    }
};

class Circle : public Ellipse {
public:
    void Draw() override final { // C26435, only 'final' is necessary.
        //...
    }
    virtual void DrawCircumference() final { // C26435, should be neither 'virtual' nor 'final'.
        //...
    }
};
```
