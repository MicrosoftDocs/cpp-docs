# C26435 SINGLE_VIRTUAL_SPECIFICATION

"Function should specify exactly one of 'virtual', 'override', or 'final'."

## C++ Core Guidelines

[C.128: Virtual functions should specify exactly one of virtual, override, or final](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md)

To improve readability, the kind of virtual behavior should be stated clearly and without unnecessary redundancy. Even though multiple virtual specifiers can be used simultaneously, it's better to specify one at a time to emphasize the most important aspect of virtual behavior. The following order of importance is apparent:

- plain virtual function;
- virtual function which explicitly overrides its base;
- virtual function which overrides its base and provides the final implementation in the current inheritance chain.

## Notes

- This rule skips destructors since they have special rules regarding virtuality.
- Warnings show up on function definitions, not declarations. It may be confusing, since definitions don't have virtual specifiers, but the warning is still appropriate.

## Example: Redundant specifier

```cpp
class Ellipse : public Shape {
public:
    void Draw() override {
        //...
    }
};

class Circle : public Ellipse {
public:
    void Draw() override final { // C26435, only 'final' is necessary.
        //...
    }
};
```
