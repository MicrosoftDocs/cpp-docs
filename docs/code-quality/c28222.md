# C28222

> warning C28222: \_Yes\_, \_No\_, or \_Maybe\_ expected for annotation

This warning indicates that a parameter to an annotation is expected to be one of the symbols `_Yes_`, `_No_`, or `_Maybe_`, and some other symbol was encountered. This usually indicates an incorrectly coded annotation macro.
