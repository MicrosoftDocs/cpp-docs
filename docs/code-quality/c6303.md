# C6303

> warning C6303: format string mismatch: wide character string passed as parameter \<number> when character string is required in call to \<function>

This warning indicates that the format string specifies that a character string is required. However, a wide character string is being passed. This defect is likely to cause a crash or corruption of some form.

## Example

The following sample code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

void f()
{
  wchar_t buff[5] = L"hi";

  printf("%s", buff);
}
```

To correct this warning, use `%ls` as shown in the following sample code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

void f()
{
  wchar_t buff[5] = L"hi";

  printf("%ls", buff);
}
```

The following sample code uses safe string manipulation function `printf_s` to correct this warning:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

void f()
{
  wchar_t buff[5] = L"hi";

  printf_s("%ls",buff);
}
```
