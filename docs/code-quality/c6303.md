# Warning C6303

> Format string mismatch.

## Remarks

This warning indicates that a format string specifies a narrow character string, but is being passed a wide character string instead. One cause of the warning is because the meaning of `%s` and `%S` flip when used with `printf` or `wprintf`. This defect can lead to crashes, in addition to potentially incorrect output.

Code analysis name: `WCHAR_CHAR_ARGUMENT_TO_FORMAT_FUNCTION`

## Example

The following example code generates this warning. `buff` is a wide character string, but the `printf_s` call expects a short string as denoted by `%s`:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

void f()
{
    wchar_t buff[5] = L"hi";
    printf_s("%s", buff);
}
```

The following example code remediates this issue by using `%ls` to specify a wide character string. Alternatively it could have switched to `%S`, which is a wide string when used with `printf` like functions.  See [Format specification syntax: `printf` and `wprintf` functions](../c-runtime-library/format-specification-syntax-printf-and-wprintf-functions.md#type-field-characters) for more options.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

void f()
{
    wchar_t buff[5] = L"hi";
    printf_s("%ls", buff);
}
```
