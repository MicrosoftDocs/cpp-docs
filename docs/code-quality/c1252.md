# Fatal error C1252

> Circular or missing dependency between plugins: '*plugin-name*' requires GUID '*globally-unique-identifier*'

## Remarks

The Code Analysis tool reports this error when there's an internal error in the plugin dependencies. It's not caused by an issue in the code being analyzed.

In some cases, it's possible to work around this issue by disabling the **Enable Code Analysis on Build** property. To disable this build property, open the Property pages dialog for your project. In the **Solution Explorer** window, right-click on the project (not the solution) and select **Properties** in the shortcut menu. Set the **Configuration** to **All Configurations** and the **Platform** to **All Platforms**. Open the **Configuration Properties** > **Code Analysis** > **General** property page. Modify the **Enable Code Analysis on Build** property to **No**. Choose **OK** to save your changes, and then save your project files. Rebuild your project to verify that the issue no longer occurs.

If the issue continues, you can report it to Microsoft. For more information on how to report an issue, see [How to report a problem with the Visual C++ toolset or documentation](../overview/how-to-report-a-problem-with-the-visual-cpp-toolset.md).
