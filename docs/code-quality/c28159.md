# Warning C28159

> Consider using *`function_name_1`* instead of *`function_name_2`*. Reason: *reason*

This warning occurs when you use a function that is semantically equivalent to an alternative, preferred function call.

## Remarks

C28159 is a general warning message; the annotation `__drv_preferredFunction` was used (possibly with a conditional `__drv_when`() annotation) to flag a bad coding practice.

Code analysis name: `USE_OTHER_FUNCTION`

## Example

The following code example generates this warning. This issue is due to the use of `OemToChar`, which doesn't validate the buffer size:

```cpp
char buff[MAX_PATH];
OemToChar(buff, input);  // If strlen(input) > MAX_PATH, this call leads to buffer overrun
```

The following code example avoids this warning by using the recommended alternative `OemToCharBuff`, which takes in the destination buffer size and limits the copy appropriately:

```cpp
char buff[MAX_PATH];
OemToCharBuff(buff, input, MAX_PATH);
```
