# C28159

> warning C28159: Consider using another function instead.

This warning is reported for Drivers is suggesting that you use a preferred function call that is semantically equivalent to the function that the driver is calling. This is a general warning message; the annotation `__drv_preferredFunction` was used (possibly with a conditional a `__drv_when`() annotation) to flag a bad coding practice.

## Example

The following code example generates this warning:

```cpp
char buff[MAX_PATH];

// if strlen(input) > MAX_PATH
// leads to buffer overrun
OemToChar(buff, input);
```

The following code example avoids this warning:

```cpp
char buff[MAX_PATH];

OemToCharBuff(buff, input, MAX_PATH);
```
