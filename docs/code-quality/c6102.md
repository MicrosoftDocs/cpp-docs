# C6102

> warning C6102: Using \<variable> from failed function call at line \<location>.

This warning is reported instead of [C6001](../code-quality/c6001.md) when a variable is not set because it was marked as an `_Out_` parameter on a prior function call that failed.

The problem might be that the prior called function is not completely annotated. It may require `_Always_`, `_Outptr_result_nullonfailure_` (`_COM_Outptr_` for COM code), or a related annotation.
