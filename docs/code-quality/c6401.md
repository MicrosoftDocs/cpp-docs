# C6401

> warning C6401: Using \<function name> in a default locale to perform a case-insensitive compare to constant string \< string name>. Yields unexpected results in non-English locales

This warning indicates that a case-insensitive comparison to a constant string is being performed when specifying the default locale; usually, a locale-independent comparison was intended.

The typical consequence of this defect is incorrect behavior in non-English speaking locales. For example, in Turkish, ".gif" will not match ".GIF"; in Vietnamese, "LogIn" will not match "LOGIN".

The `CompareString` function takes a locale as an argument; however, passing in a default locale, for example, the constant `LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT`, will cause different behaviors in different locales, depending on the user's default. Usually, case-insensitive comparisons against a constant string should be performed in a locale-independent comparison.

To perform a locale-independent comparison using `CompareString` on Windows XP, the first parameter should be the constant `LOCALE_INVARIANT`; for example, to perform a locale-independent test for whether `pString` matches file1.gif ignoring upper/lower case differences, use a call such as:

```cpp
CompareString(LOCALE_INVARIANT,
              NORM_IGNORECASE,
              pString,
              -1,
              TEXT("file1.gif"),
              -1) == CSTR_EQUAL
```

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
include <windows.h>

int fd(char *ext)
{
  return (CompareString(LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT,
                        NORM_IGNORECASE,
                        ext,
                        -1,
                        TEXT("gif"),
                        -1) == 2);
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
include <windows.h>
int f(char *ext)
{
  return (CompareString(LOCALE_INVARIANT,
                        NORM_IGNORECASE,
                        ext,
                        -1,
                        TEXT("gif"),
                        -1) == 2);
}
```
