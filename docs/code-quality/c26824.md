# Warning C26824

> Postcondition for null pointer '*variable*' requires it to be non-null (lifetime.1)

## Remarks

Dereferencing a null pointer is a frequent problem in C and C++. We have several checks to deal with such problems. See this [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/improved-null-pointer-dereference-detection-in-visual-studio-2022-version-17-0-preview-4/) for a comparison. When the analysis engine sees a null pointer returned from a function that has a contract forbidding such an operation, it will emit a `C26824` warning. You can also enable [C26825](../code-quality/c26825.md) for a stricter analysis. This check only works on functions annotated using [SAL annotations](../code-quality/understanding-sal.md).

## Example

```cpp
void postcondition_conditional(bool b, _When_(b == true, _Outptr_) int** p)  { 
    if (b == true) 
        *p = nullptr; // C26824 warning 
} 
```

To solve this warning, make sure there's no null pointer returned from the annotated function. Or, change the annotations to reflect the behavior of the function.
