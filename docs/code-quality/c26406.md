# Warning C26406

> Do not assign a raw pointer to an `owner<T>` (r.3)

This warning enforces R.3 from the C++ Core Guidelines. For more information, see [C++ Core Guidelines R.3](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-ptr).

## Remarks

Owners are initialized from allocations or from other owners. This warning occurs when you assign a value from a raw pointer to an owner pointer. Raw pointers don't guarantee ownership transfer; the original owner may still hold the resource and attempt to release it. It's okay to assign a value from an owner to a raw pointer. Raw pointers are valid clients to access resources, but not to manage them.

Code analysis name: `DONT_ASSIGN_RAW_TO_OWNER`

## Example

Using address of object:

This sample attempts to assign ownership of the address of `defaultSocket` to owner pointer `socket`:

```cpp
gsl::owner<Socket*> socket = defaultSocket ? &defaultSocket : new Socket(); // C26406
```
