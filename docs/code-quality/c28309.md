# Warning C28309

> <parameter_name>: Annotation operands must be integer/enum/pointer types. Void operands and C++ overloaded operators are not supported. Floats are approximated as integers. Types: '*typelist*'.

You've tried to use a void or a function in an annotation expression, and Code Analysis can't handle it.  This error typically occurs when an `operator==` that's implemented as a function is used, but other cases may also occur. Examine the types in \<typelist> for clues about what's wrong.
