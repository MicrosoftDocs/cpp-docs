# Warning C6214

> Cast between semantically different integer types: HRESULT to a Boolean type

## Remarks

This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is being cast to a Boolean type. The success value (`S_OK`) of an `HRESULT` equals 0. However, 0 indicates failure for a Boolean type. Casting an `HRESULT` to a Boolean type and then using it in a test expression will yield an incorrect result.

Sometimes, this warning occurs if an `HRESULT` is being stored in a Boolean variable. Any comparison that uses the Boolean variable to test for `HRESULT` success or failure could lead to incorrect results.

Code analysis name: `CAST_HRESULT_TO_BOOL`

## Example

The following code generates warning C6214:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

BOOL f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;
  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);
  if ((BOOL)hr) // warning C6214
  {
    // success code ...
    return TRUE;
  }
  else
  {
    // failure code ...
    return FALSE;
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

BOOL f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);
  if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
  {
    // success code ...
    return TRUE;
  }
  else
  {
    // failure code ...
    return FALSE;
  }
}
```

For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.

Usually, the `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` macro should be used to test the value of an `HRESULT`.

[`FAILED`](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed)

To make use of modern C++ memory allocation methodology, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Library (STL). These include [`shared_ptr`](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [`unique_ptr`](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and containers such as [`vector`](../standard-library/vector.md).
