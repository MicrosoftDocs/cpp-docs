# C28106

> warning C28106: Variable already holds resource possibly causing leak

A variable that contains a resource is used in a context in which a new value can be placed in the variable. If this occurs, the resource can be lost and not properly freed, causing a resource leak.

## Example

The following code example generates this warning:

```cpp
ExAcquireResourceLite(resource, true);
//...
ExAcquireResourceLite(resource, true);
```

The following code example avoids this warning:

```cpp
ExAcquireResourceLite(resource1, true);
//...
ExAcquireResourceLite(resource2, true);
```
