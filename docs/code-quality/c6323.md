# C6323

> warning C6323 - use of arithmetic operator on Boolean type(s)

This warning occurs if arithmetic operators are used on Boolean data types. Use of incorrect operator might yield incorrect results. It also indicates that the programmer's intent is not reflected in the code.

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
int test(bool a, bool b)
{
    int c = a + b;     //C6323
    return c;
}
```

To correct this warning, use correct data type and operator.

```cpp
int test(int a, int b)
{
    int c = a + b;
    return c;
}
```
