# Warning C26452

> Arithmetic overflow: Left shift count is negative or greater than or equal to the operand size, which is undefined behavior (io.3)

## Remarks

This warning indicates the shift count is negative, or greater than or equal to the number of bits in the shifted operand. Either case results in undefined behavior.

Warning [C4293](../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-1-c4293.md) is a similar check in the Microsoft C++ compiler.

Code analysis name: `SHIFT_COUNT_NEGATIVE_OR_TOO_BIG`

## Example

```cpp
unsigned long long combine(unsigned lo, unsigned hi)
{
  return (hi << 32) | lo; // C26252 here
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
unsigned long long combine(unsigned lo, unsigned hi)
{
  return (static_cast<unsigned __int64>(hi) << 32) | lo; // OK
}
```
