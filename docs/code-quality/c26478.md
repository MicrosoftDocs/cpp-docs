# Warning C26478

> Don't use `std::move` on constant variables. (es.56)

## Remarks

This warning is to indicate that the use of `std::move` not consistent with how `std::move` is intended to be used.

Because `const` objects can't be moved, calling `std::move` on them has no effect. This pattern can result in unintended copies.

Code analysis name: `NO_MOVE_OP_ON_CONST`

## Example

```cpp
struct node
{
    node* next;
    int id;
};

void foo(const node& n)
{
    const node local = std::move(n); // C26478 reported here
    // ...
}
```

To fix the issue, remove the redundant `std::move`.
