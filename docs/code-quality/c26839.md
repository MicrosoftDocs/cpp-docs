# Warning C26839

> Array new allocation size is the result of a signed to unsigned narrowing conversion that could result in overflow if the signed value is negative.

This warning was added in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.13.

## Remarks

Reports that the size specified for an array `new` allocation may be the result of the conversion of a possibly negative signed value to an unsigned value. For example:

```cpp
int* CreateIntArray(int size)
{
    int* intArray = new int[size];
    return intArray;
}
```

The expression `new int[size]`, `size` is signed. The compiler converts the signed value to an unsigned value to calculate how many bytes to be allocated for the array. When `size` is negative, the result of that calculation may overflow or have unexpected results when passed to `new`.

This check is the same as [`C26838`](c26838.md), but applies only to `new T[]`.

This check sometimes fails to recognize that certain checks can prevent overflows because the check is conservative.

## Example

To fix the previous code example in which the size calculation might overflow due to a negative signed value, introduce a check to ensure it won't. For example:

```cpp
int* CreateIntArray(int size)
{
    if (size < 0)
        return nullptr;

    int* intArray = new int[size];
    return intArray;
}
```
