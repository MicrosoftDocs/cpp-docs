# Warning C26444

> Don't try to declare a local variable with no name (es.84).

## C++ Core Guidelines

[ES.84: Don't (try to) declare a local variable with no name](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-noname)

An unnamed variable declaration creates a temporary object that is discarded at the end of the statement. Such temporary objects with nontrivial behavior may point to either inefficient code that allocates and immediately throws away resources or to the code that unintentionally ignores nonprimitive data. Sometimes it may also indicate plainly wrong declaration.

## Remarks

- This rule detects types with a hand-written destructor or a compiler-generated destructor that transitively calls a hand-written destructor.
- This rule can flag code that invokes a nontrivial constructor of a RAII type.
- The logic skips temporaries if they're used in higher-level expressions. One example is temporaries that are passed as arguments or used to invoke a function.

Code analysis name: `NO_UNNAMED_RAII_OBJECTS`

## Examples

```cpp
struct A { A(int i); ~A(); };
void Foo()
{
    A{42}; // warning C26444: Don't try to declare a local variable with no name (es.84).
}
```

To fix the issue, convert the temporary object to a local.

```cpp
struct A { A(int i); ~A(); };
void Foo()
{
    A guard{42}; // OK.
}
```
