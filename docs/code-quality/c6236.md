# Warning C6236

> ('*expression*' \|\| '*non-zero constant*') is always a non-zero constant

This warning indicates that a non-zero constant value, other than one, was detected on the right side of a logical OR operation that occurs in a test context. Logically, it implies that the test is redundant and can be removed safely. Alternatively, it suggests that the programmer may have intended to use a different operator, for example, the equality (`==`), bitwise-AND (`&`) or bitwise-XOR (`^`) operator, to test for a specific value or flag.

## Remarks

This warning isn't generated for the common idiom when the non-zero constant is 1, because of its use for selectively enabling code paths at compile time. However, the warning is generated if the non-zero constant is formed by an expression that evaluates to 1, for example, 1 + 0.

Code analysis name: `LOGICALORNONZERO`

## Example

This code shows how warning C6236 can appear. Because `INPUT_TYPE` isn't 0, the expression `n || INPUT_TYPE` is always non-zero, and the **`else`** clause is never executed. However, `INPUT_TYPE` is a constant with a value other than one, which suggests that it's meant as a value for comparison:

```cpp
#define INPUT_TYPE 2
#include <stdio.h>

void f( int n )
{
   if ( n || INPUT_TYPE ) // analysis warning C6236
   {
      puts( "Always gets here" );
   }
   else
   {
      puts( "Never enters here" );
   }
}
```

The following code instead uses a bitwise-AND (`&`) operator to test whether the `INPUT_TYPE` bit of the input parameter `n` is set:

```cpp
#define INPUT_TYPE 2
#include <stdio.h>

void f( int n )
{
   if ( n & INPUT_TYPE ) // no warning
   {
      puts( "Bitwise-AND comparison is true" );
   }
   else
   {
      puts( "Bitwise-AND comparison is false" );
   }
}
```
