# Warning C6242

> A jump out of this try-block forces local unwind. Incurs severe performance penalty

This warning indicates that a jump statement causes control-flow to leave the protected block of a `try-finally` other than by fall-through.

## Remarks

Leaving the protected block of a `try-finally` other than by falling through from the last statement requires local unwind to occur. Local unwind typically requires approximately 1000 machine instructions, so it's detrimental to performance.

Use **`__leave`** to exit the protected block of a try-finally.

Code analysis name: `LOCALUNWINDFORCED`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <malloc.h>
void DoSomething(char *p); // function can throw exception

int f( )
{
   char *ptr = 0;
   __try
   {
      ptr = (char*) malloc(10);
      if ( !ptr )
      {
         return 0;   //Warning: 6242
      }
      DoSomething( ptr );
   }
   __finally
   {
      free( ptr );
   }
   return 1;
}
```

To correct this warning, use **`__leave`** as shown in the following code:

```cpp
#include <malloc.h>
void DoSomething(char *p);
int f()
{
   char *ptr = 0;
   int retVal = 0;

   __try
   {
      ptr = (char *) malloc(10);
      if ( !ptr )
      {
         retVal = 0;
         __leave;   //No warning
      }
      DoSomething( ptr );
      retVal = 1;
   }
   __finally
   {
      free( ptr );
   }

   return retVal;
}
```

The use of `malloc` and `free` have many pitfalls in terms of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of leaks and exception problems altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Library. These include [`shared_ptr`](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [`unique_ptr`](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and [`vector`](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).
