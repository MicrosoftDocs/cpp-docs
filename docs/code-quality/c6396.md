# Warning C6396

> sizeof('integerConstant') always returns the size of the underlying integer type

## Remarks

This warning indicates where an integral constant is used as a `sizeof` argument. Such expression always returns the size of the type of the constant. It's better to write `sizeof(type)` instead. This warning catches common typos in buffer offset calculations.

This check ignores character literals because `buffer_size += sizeof(UNICODE_NULL)` is a common idiom.

## Example

The following example generates C6396:

```cpp
void f()
{  
    int a = sizeof(5);         // C6396 reported here
}
```

To fix this issue, replace the integral constant with its type:

```cpp
void f()
{  
    int a = sizeof(int);         // no C6396 reported here
}
```
