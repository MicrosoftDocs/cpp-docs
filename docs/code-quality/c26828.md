# C26828

> Warning C26828: Different enum types have overlapping values. Did you want to use another enum constant here?

Most of the times we use a single enum to describe all the bit flags we can use for an option. If we use two different enum types in the same bitwise expression where the enums have overlapping values the chances are good those enums were not designed to be used in the expression.

## Example

```cpp

enum BitWiseA
{
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = 4
};

enum class BitWiseB
{
    AA = 1,
    BB = 2,
    CC = 4,
    All = 7
};

int overlappingBitwiseEnums(BitWiseA a) 
{
    return (int)a|(int)BitWiseB::AA; // Warning C26828: Different enum types have overlapping values. Did you want to use another enum constant here?
}
```

To fix the warning make sure `enum`s that are designed to be used together have no overlapping values or make sure all the related options are in a single `enum`.

```cpp

enum BitWiseA
{
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = 4
};

int overlappingBitwiseEnums(BitWiseA a) 
{
    return (int)a|(int)BitWiseA::A; // No warning.
}
```
