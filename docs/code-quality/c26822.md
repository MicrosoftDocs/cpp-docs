# Warning C26822

> Dereferencing a null pointer '*variable*' (lifetime.1)

## Remarks

Dereferencing a null pointer is frequent problem in C and C++. We have several checks to deal with such problems. See this [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/improved-null-pointer-dereference-detection-in-visual-studio-2022-version-17-0-preview-4/) for a comparison. When the analysis engine deduces the value of a pointer to be null and sees that pointer get dereferenced, it will emit a `C26822` warning. You can also enable [C26823](../code-quality/c26823.md) for a stricter analysis. This check also supports [SAL annotations](../code-quality/understanding-sal.md) and [`gsl::not_null`](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL) to describe invariants of the code.

## Example

```cpp
void f(int *p) { 
    if (p == nullptr) 
        *p = 42; // warning: C26822
} 

void assign_to_gsl_notnull() { 
    int* p = nullptr; 
    auto q = gsl::make_not_null(p); // C26822 warning 
} 
```

To solve this warning, make sure there's no null pointer dereference in the code, potentially by adding null checks. In case the code was found to be correct, false positive findings can often be fixed by using `gsl::not_null` or SAL annotations. There are some examples how to use some of those annotations below:

```cpp
_Notnull_ int *get_my_ptr(); 
gsl::not_null<int *> get_my_ptr2(); 

void local_analysis(int *p) { 
    _Analysis_assume_(p != nullptr); 
    *p = 42; 
} 

void local_analysis2(_In_ int *p) { 
    int a = *p; 
} 
```
