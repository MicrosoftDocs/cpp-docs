# Warning C6297

> Arithmetic overflow: 32-bit value is shifted, then cast to 64-bit value. Result may not be an expected value

## Remarks

This warning indicates incorrect behavior that results from integral promotion rules and types larger than the ones in which arithmetic is typically performed.

In this case, a 32-bit value was shifted left, and the result of that shift was cast to a 64-bit value. If the shift overflowed the 32-bit value, bits are lost.

If you don't want to lose bits, cast the value to shift to a 64-bit quantity before it's shifted. If you want to lose bits, perform the appropriate cast to `unsigned long` or a `short` type. Or, mask the result of the shift. Either approach eliminates this warning and makes the intent of the code clearer.

Code analysis name: `RESULTOFSHIFTCASTTOLARGERSIZE`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
void f(int i)
{
  unsigned __int64 x;

  x = i << 34;
  // code
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void f(int i)
{
  unsigned __int64 x;
  // code
  x = static_cast<unsigned __int64>(i) << 34;
}
```
