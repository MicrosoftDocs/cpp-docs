# C26485 NO_ARRAY_TO_POINTER_DECAY

> warning C26485: Expression '*array-name*': No array to pointer decay (bounds.3).

## Remarks

Like [C26481](c26481.md), this check helps to enforce the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md) rule [I.13](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Ri-array): *Do not pass an array as a single pointer*. The rule detects places where static array type information is lost from decay to a raw pointer. The `zstring` and `czstring` types are not excluded.

C26481 and C26485 come from the [Bounds Safety Profile](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#SS-bounds) rules. These rules were implemented in the first release of the C++ Core Guidelines Checker. They're applicable to the raw pointers category since they help to avoid unsafe use of raw pointers.

## Example

This sample results in two warnings for array to pointer decay in the call to `memcpy`.

```cpp
// c26485_bad.cpp
// compile using:
// set Esp.Extensions=CppCoreCheck.dll
// cl /W4 /EHsc /permissive- /analyze /analyze:plugin EspXEngine.dll /analyze:ruleset "%VSINSTALLDIR%\Team Tools\Static Analysis Tools\Rule Sets\CppCoreCheckBoundsRules.ruleset" c26485_bad.cpp
#include <cstring>
constexpr int array_length = 10;

int main() noexcept
{
    int const from_array[array_length] = { 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 };
    int to_array[array_length] = {};

    if (nullptr != memcpy(to_array, from_array, sizeof(int) * array_length))
        return 0;
    return 1;
}
```

To address this issue, avoid calls that take pointer parameters, but don't manage bounds information. Use of such functions is often error-prone. Prefer C++ standard library calls to C runtime library functions. Consider using `gsl::span` or `std::vector` in your own functions. An explicit cast to the decayed pointer type prevents the warning, but it doesn't prevent buggy code.
