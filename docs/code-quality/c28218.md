# Warning C28218

> For function parameter, the annotation's parameter does not match that found at file

The annotations on the current line and on the line in the message are inconsistent. This inconsistency shouldn't be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations. We don't expect this warning to be seen in normal use.
