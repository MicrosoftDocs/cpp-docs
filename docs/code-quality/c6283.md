# Warning C6283

> '*variable-name*' is allocated with array new [], but deleted with scalar delete

This warning appears only in C++ code and indicates that the calling function has inconsistently allocated memory with the array `new []` operator, but freed it with the scalar `delete` operator.

## Remarks

This defect might cause leaks, memory corruptions, and, in situations where operators have been overridden, crashes. If memory is allocated with array `new []`, it should typically be freed with array `delete[]`.

Warning C6283 only applies to arrays of primitive types such as integers or characters. If elements of the array are objects of class type then warning [C6278](../code-quality/c6278.md) is issued.

The use of `new` and `delete` has many pitfalls in terms of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of potential leaks altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Library (STL). These include [`shared_ptr`](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [`unique_ptr`](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and containers such as [`vector`](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).

Code analysis name: `PRIMITIVE_ARRAY_NEW_DELETE_MISMATCH`

## Example

The following code generates warning C6283. `str` is allocated using `new ...[...]` but is freed using the mismatched function `delete`:

```cpp
void f( )
{
    char *str = new char[50];
    delete str;
}
```

The following code remediates this warning by using the matching function `delete[]`:

```cpp
void f( )
{
    char *str = new char[50];
    delete[] str;
}
```
