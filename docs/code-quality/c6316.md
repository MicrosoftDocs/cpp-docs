# Warning C6316

> Incorrect operator: tested expression is constant and non-zero. Use bitwise-and to determine whether bits are set

## Remarks

This warning indicates the use of bitwise-or (`|`) when bitwise-and (`&`) should have been used. Bitwise-or adds bits to the resulting expression, whereas bitwise-and selects only those bits in common between its two operators. Tests for flags must be performed with bitwise-and or a test of equality.

Code analysis name: `INAPPROPRIATEUSEOFBITOR`

## Example

The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
#define INPUT_VALUE 2
void f( int Flags)
{
  if (Flags | INPUT_VALUE) // warning
  {
    // code
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
#define ALLOWED 1
#define INPUT_VALUE 2

void f( int Flags)
{
  if ((Flags & INPUT_VALUE) == ALLOWED)
  {
    // code
  }
}
```
