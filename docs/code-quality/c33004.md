# C33004

> Warning C33004: VARIANT 'var', which is marked as _Out_ was cleared before being initialized (expression 'expr')

This warning is triggered when a VARIANT parameter with \_Out\_ SAL annotation, which may haven't been initialized on input, is passed to an API such as VariantClear that expects an initialized VARIANT.

## Example

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

void t2(_Out_ VARIANT* pv)
{
    // ......
    VariantClear(pv);   // C33004
    // ......
}
```

These warnings are corrected by ensuring VariantClear is called only for a properly initialized VARIANT:
```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

void t2(_Out_ VARIANT* pv)
{
    VariantInit(pv);
    // ......
    VariantClear(pv);   // OK
    // ......
}
```
