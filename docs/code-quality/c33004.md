# Warning C33004

> VARIANT '*var*', which is marked as `_Out_` was cleared before being initialized (expression '*expr*')

## Remarks

This warning is triggered when a `VARIANT` parameter with `_Out_` SAL annotation may not have been
initialized on input, and is then passed to an API such as `VariantClear` that expects an initialized `VARIANT`.

Code analysis name: `VARIANTCLEAR_UNINITOUTPARAM`

## Example

The following sample code causes warning C33004:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

void t2(_Out_ VARIANT* pv)
{
    // ......
    VariantClear(pv);   // C33004
    // ......
}
```

These warnings are corrected by ensuring VariantClear is called only for a properly initialized VARIANT:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

void t2(_Out_ VARIANT* pv)
{
    VariantInit(pv);
    // ......
    VariantClear(pv);   // OK
    // ......
}
```
