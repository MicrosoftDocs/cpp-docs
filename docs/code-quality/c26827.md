# C26827

> Warning C26827: Did you forgot to initialize an enum or wanted to use another type? 

Most `enum` types used in bitwise operations are expected to have members with values of powers of two. This warning attempts to find cases where we forgot to give a value to an enum constant explicitly or inadvertently used the wrong enum type.

## Example

```cpp
enum class AlmostBitWise
{
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = 4,
    D
};

int almostBitwiseEnums(AlmostBitWise a, bool cond) 
{
    return (int)a|(int)AlmostBitWise::A; // Warning C26827: Did you forgot to initialize an enum or wanted to use another type?
}
```

To fix the warning, initialize the enum constant to the correct value or use the correct enum type in the operation.

```cpp
enum class AlmostBitWise
{
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = 4,
    D = 8
};

int almostBitwiseEnums(AlmostBitWise a, bool cond) 
{
    return (int)a|(int)AlmostBitWise::A; // No warning.
}
```
