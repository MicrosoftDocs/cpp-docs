# Warning C26827

> Did you forget to initialize an enum, or intend to use another type?

## Remarks

Most `enum` types used in bitwise operations are expected to have members with values of powers of two. This warning attempts to find cases where a value wasn't given explicitly to an enumeration constant. It also finds cases where the wrong enumeration type may have been used inadvertently.

Code analysis name: `ALMOST_BITWISE_ENUM`

## Example

The following sample code causes warning C26827:

```cpp
enum class AlmostBitWise
{
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = 4,
    D
};

int almostBitwiseEnums(AlmostBitWise a, bool cond) 
{
    return (int)a|(int)AlmostBitWise::A; // Warning C26827: Did you forget to initialize an enum, or intend to use another type?
}
```

To fix the warning, initialize the enumeration constant to the correct value, or use the correct enumeration type in the operation.

```cpp
enum class AlmostBitWise
{
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = 4,
    D = 8
};

int almostBitwiseEnums(AlmostBitWise a, bool cond) 
{
    return (int)a|(int)AlmostBitWise::A; // No warning.
}
```
