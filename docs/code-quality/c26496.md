# Warning C26496

> The variable '*variable*' is assigned only once, mark it as `const`.

## See also

[C++ Core Guidelines con.4](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#con4-use-const-to-define-objects-with-values-that-do-not-change-after-construction).

## Example

```cpp
int GetTheNumber();
int GiveMeTheNumber(int);

void function1()
{
    int theNumber = GetTheNumber(); // C26496, 'theNumber' is never assigned to again, so it can be marked as const
    std::cout << theNumber << '\n';

    GiveMeTheNumber(theNumber);
    // ...
}
```
