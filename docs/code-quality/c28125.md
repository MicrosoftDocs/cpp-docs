# C28125

> warning C28125: The function must be called from within a try/except block

The driver is calling a function that must be called from within a try/except block, such as [ProbeForRead](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-probeforread), [ProbeForWrite](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-probeforwrite), [MmProbeAndLockPages](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-mmprobeandlockpages).

## Example

The following code example generates this warning:

```cpp
ProbeForRead(addr, len, 4);
```

The following code example avoids this warning:

```cpp
__try
{
    ProbeForRead(addr, len, 4);
}
__except(EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER)
{
    Status = GetExceptionCode();
    ... report error status
}
```
