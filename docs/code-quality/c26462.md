# Warning C26462

> The value pointed to by '*variable*' is assigned only once, mark it as a pointer to `const` (con.4).

## Remarks

Pointers to variables whose values remain unchanged should be marked as `const`.

Code analysis name: `USE_CONST_POINTER_FOR_VARIABLE`

## Example

```cpp
void useVal(int val);

void function1(int* ptr)
{
    int* p = ptr; // C26462, the value pointed to by p is unmodified
    ptr = nullptr;

    useVal(*p);
}
```
