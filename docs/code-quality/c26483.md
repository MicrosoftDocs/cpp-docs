# Warning C26483

> Value '*value*' is outside the bounds (0, '*bound*') of variable '*variable*'. Only index into arrays using constant expressions that are within bounds of the array (bounds.2).

## Example

```cpp
void function()
{
    std::array<int, 3> arr1 { 1, 2, 3 };
    arr1[3] = 4; // C26483, 3 is outside the bounds of the array

    int arr2[] { 1, 2, 3 };
    arr2[3] = 4; // C26483, 3 is outside the bounds of the array
}
```
