# Warning C6308

> 'realloc' may return null pointer: assigning a null pointer to '*parameter-name*', which is passed as an argument to 'realloc', will cause the original memory block to be leaked

## Remarks

Heap reallocation functions don't free the passed buffer if reallocation is unsuccessful, potentially resulting in a memory leak if not handled properly. To correct the issue, assign the result of the reallocation function to a temporary variable, and then replace the original pointer after successful reallocation.

Code analysis name: `REALLOCLEAK`

## Example

The following sample code generates warning C6308. This issue stems from the assignment of the return value from `realloc` to `x`. If `realloc` fails and returns a null pointer, then the original memory pointed to by `x` won't be freed:

```cpp
#include <malloc.h>
#include <windows.h>

void f( )
{
    char *x = (char *) malloc(10);
    if (x != NULL)
    {
        x = (char *) realloc(x, 512);
        // code...
        free(x);
    }
}
```

To resolve the issue, you can create a temporary variable to store the return value of `realloc`. This change allows you to free the previously allocated memory safely if `realloc` fails:

```cpp
#include <malloc.h>
#include <windows.h>

void f()
{
    char *x = (char *) malloc(10);
    if (x != NULL)
    {
        char *tmp = (char *) realloc(x,512);
        if (tmp != NULL)
        {
            x = tmp;
        }
        // code...
        free(x);
    }
}
```

This warning might generate noise if there's a live alias to the buffer-to-be-reallocated at the time of the assignment of the result of the reallocation function.

To avoid these kinds of issues altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Library (STL). These include [`shared_ptr`](../standard-library/shared-ptr-class.md), [`unique_ptr`](../standard-library/unique-ptr-class.md), and containers such as [`vector`](../standard-library/vector.md). For more information, see [Smart pointers](../cpp/smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md) and [C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md).
