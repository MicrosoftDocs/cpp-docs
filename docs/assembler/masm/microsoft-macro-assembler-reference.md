# Microsoft Macro Assembler reference

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) provides several advantages over inline assembly. MASM contains a macro language that has features such as looping, arithmetic, and text string processing. MASM gives you greater control over the hardware. By using MASM, you also can reduce time and memory overhead in your code.
