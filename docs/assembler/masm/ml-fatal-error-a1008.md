# ML Fatal Error A1008

**unmatched macro nesting**

Either a macro was not terminated before the end of the file or the terminating directive [ENDM](../../assembler/masm/endm.md) was found outside of a macro block.

One cause of this error is omission of the dot before [.REPEAT](../../assembler/masm/dot-repeat.md) or [.WHILE](../../assembler/masm/dot-while.md).
