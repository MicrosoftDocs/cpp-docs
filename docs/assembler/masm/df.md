Allocates and optionally initializes 6 bytes of storage for each `initializer`. `DF` is a synonym of [FWORD](../../assembler/masm/fword.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
[[name]] DF initializer [[, initializer]]...  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Also can be used as a type specifier anywhere a type is legal.
