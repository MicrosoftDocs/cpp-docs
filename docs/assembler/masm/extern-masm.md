# EXTERN

Defines one or more external variables, labels, or symbols called *name* whose type is *type*.

## Syntax

> **EXTERN** ⟦*language-type*⟧ *name* ⟦ __(__*altid*__)__ ⟧ __:__ *type* ⟦__,__ ⟦*language-type*⟧ *name* ⟦ __(__*altid*__)__ ⟧ __:__ *type* ...⟧

## Remarks

The *language-type* argument is valid in 32-bit MASM only.

The *type* can be [ABS](operator-abs.md), which imports *name* as a constant. Same as [EXTRN](extrn.md).

The *type* can also be PROC, in which case *name* is treated as an external procedure.
