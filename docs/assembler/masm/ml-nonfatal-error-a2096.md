# ML Nonfatal Error A2096

**segment, group, or segment register expected**

A segment or group was expected but was not found.

One of the following occurred:

- The left operand specified with the segment override operator (**:**) was not a segment register (CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, or GS), group name, segment name, or segment expression.

- The [ASSUME](../../assembler/masm/assume.md) directive was given a segment register without a valid segment address, segment register, group, or the special **FLAT** group.
