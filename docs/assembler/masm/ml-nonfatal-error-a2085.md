# ML Nonfatal Error A2085
**instruction or register not accepted in current CPU mode**  
  
 An attempt was made to use an instruction, register, or keyword that was not valid for the current processor mode.  
  
 For example, 32-bit registers require [.386](../../assembler/masm/dot-386.md) or above. Control registers such as CR0 require privileged mode [.386P](../../assembler/masm/dot-386p.md) or above. This error will also be generated for the **NEAR32**, **FAR32**, and **FLAT** keywords, which require .**386** or above.
