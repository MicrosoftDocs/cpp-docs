# ML Nonfatal Error A2008

**syntax error :**

A token at the current location caused a syntax error.

One of the following may have occurred:

- A dot prefix was added to or omitted from a directive.

- A reserved word (such as **C** or **SIZE**) was used as an identifier.

- An instruction was used that was not available with the current processor or coprocessor selection.

- A comparison run-time operator (such as `==`) was used in a conditional assembly statement instead of a relational operator (such as [EQ](../../assembler/masm/operator-eq.md)).

- An instruction or directive was given too few operands.

- An obsolete directive was used.
