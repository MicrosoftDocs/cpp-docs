# GOTO (MASM)

Transfers assembly to the line marked **:**_macrolabel_.

## Syntax

> **GOTO** *macrolabel*

## Remarks

**GOTO** is permitted only inside [MACRO](macro.md), [FOR](for-masm.md), [FORC](forc.md), [REPEAT](repeat.md), and [WHILE](while-masm.md) blocks. The *macrolabel* target must be the only directive on the line and must be preceded by a leading colon.
