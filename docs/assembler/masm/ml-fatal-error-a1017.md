# ML Fatal Error A1017

**missing source filename**

ML could not find a file to assemble or pass to the linker.

This error is generated when you give ML command-line options without specifying a filename to act upon. To assemble files that do not have an .asm extension, use the **/Ta** command-line option.

This error can also be generated by invoking ML with no parameters if the ML environment variable contains command-line options.
