# ML Error Messages
The error messages generated by MASM components fall into three categories:  
  
-   **Fatal errors.** These indicate a severe problem that prevents the utility from completing its normal process.  
  
-   **Nonfatal errors.** The utility may complete its process. If it does, its result is not likely to be the one you want.  
  
-   **Warnings.** These messages indicate conditions that may prevent you from getting the results you want.  
  
 All error messages take the following form:  
  
```  
  
Utility: Filename (Line) : [Error_type} (Code): Message_text  
```  
  
 where:  
  
 `Utility`  
 The program that sent the error message.  
  
 *Filename*  
 The file that contains the error-generating condition.  
  
 *Line*  
 The approximate line where the error condition exists.  
  
 *Error_type*  
 Fatal Error, Error, or Warning.  
  
 *Code*  
 The unique 5- or 6-digit error code.  
  
 `Message_text`  
 A short and general description of the error condition.
