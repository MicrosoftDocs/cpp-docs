# ML Error Messages

The error messages generated by MASM components fall into three categories:

- **Fatal errors.** These indicate a severe problem that prevents the utility from completing its normal process.

- **Nonfatal errors.** The utility may complete its process. If it does, its result is not likely to be the one you want.

- **Warnings.** These messages indicate conditions that may prevent you from getting the results you want.

All error messages take the following form:

> *Utility*: *Filename* (*Line*) : {*Error_type*} (*Code*): *Message_text*

where:

*Utility*\
The program that sent the error message.

*Filename*\
The file that contains the error-generating condition.

*Line*\
The approximate line where the error condition exists.

*Error_type*\
Fatal Error, Error, or Warning.

*Code*\
The unique 5- or 6-digit error code.

*Message_text*\
A short and general description of the error condition.
