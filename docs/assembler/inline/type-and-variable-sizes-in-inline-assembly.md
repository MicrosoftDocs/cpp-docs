# Type and Variable Sizes in Inline Assembly

**Microsoft Specific**

The **LENGTH**, **SIZE**, and **TYPE** operators have a limited meaning in inline assembly. They cannot be used at all with the `DUP` operator (because you cannot define data with MASM directives or operators). But you can use them to find the size of C or C++ variables or types:

- The **LENGTH** operator can return the number of elements in an array. It returns the value 1 for non-array variables.

- The **SIZE** operator can return the size of a C or C++ variable. A variable's size is the product of its **LENGTH** and **TYPE**.

- The **TYPE** operator can return the size of a C or C++ type or variable. If the variable is an array, **TYPE** returns the size of a single element of the array.

For example, if your program has an 8-element **int** array,

```cpp
int arr[8];
```

the following C and assembly expressions yield the size of `arr` and its elements.

|__asm|C|Size|
|-------------|-------|----------|
|**LENGTH** arr|`sizeof`(arr)/`sizeof`(arr[0])|8|
|**SIZE** arr|`sizeof`(arr)|32|
|**TYPE** arr|`sizeof`(arr[0])|4|
