# Optimizing Inline Assembly

**Microsoft Specific**

The presence of an `__asm` block in a function affects optimization in several ways. First, the compiler doesn't try to optimize the `__asm` block itself. What you write in assembly language is exactly what you get. Second, the presence of an `__asm` block affects register variable storage. The compiler avoids enregistering variables across an `__asm` block if the register's contents would be changed by the `__asm` block. Finally, some other function-wide optimizations will be affected by the inclusion of assembly language in a function.
