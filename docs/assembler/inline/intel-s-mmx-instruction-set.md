# Intel&#39;s MMX Instruction Set

**Microsoft Specific**

The Microsoft C++ compiler allows you to use Intel's MMX (multimedia extension) instruction set in the inline assembler. The MMX instructions are also supported by the debugger disassembly. The compiler generates a warning message if the function contains MMX instructions but does not contain an EMMS instruction to empty the multimedia state. For more information, see the Intel Web site.
