# MASM Macro Directives in Inline Assembly

**Microsoft Specific**

The inline assembler is not a macro assembler. You cannot use MASM macro directives (**MACRO**, `REPT`, **IRC**, `IRP`, and `ENDM`) or macro operators (**<>**, **!**, **&**, `%`, and `.TYPE`). An `__asm` block can use C preprocessor directives, however. See [Using C or C++ in __asm Blocks](../../assembler/inline/using-c-or-cpp-in-asm-blocks.md) for more information.
