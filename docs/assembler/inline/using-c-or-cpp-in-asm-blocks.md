# Using C or C++ in __asm Blocks

** Microsoft Specific **

Because inline assembly instructions can be mixed with C or C++ statements, they can refer to C or C++ variables by name and use many other elements of those languages.

An `__asm` block can use the following language elements:

- Symbols, including labels and variable and function names

- Constants, including symbolic constants and `enum` members

- Macros and preprocessor directives

- Comments (both __/\* \*/__ and __//__ )

- Type names (wherever a MASM type would be legal)

- `typedef` names, generally used with operators such as **PTR** and **TYPE** or to specify structure or union members

Within an `__asm` block, you can specify integer constants with either C notation or assembler radix notation (0x100 and 100h are equivalent, for example). This allows you to define (using `#define`) a constant in C and then use it in both C or C++ and assembly portions of the program. You can also specify constants in octal by preceding them with a 0. For example, 0777 specifies an octal constant.
