# Using C or C++ Symbols in __asm Blocks

**Microsoft Specific**

An `__asm` block can refer to any C or C++ symbol in scope where the block appears. (C and C++ symbols are variable names, function names, and labels; that is, names that aren't symbolic constants or `enum` members. You cannot call C++ member functions.)

A few restrictions apply to the use of C and C++ symbols:

- Each assembly-language statement can contain only one C or C++ symbol. Multiple symbols can appear in the same assembly instruction only with **LENGTH**, **TYPE**, and **SIZE** expressions.

- Functions referenced in an `__asm` block must be declared (prototyped) earlier in the program. Otherwise, the compiler cannot distinguish between function names and labels in the `__asm` block.

- An `__asm` block cannot use any C or C++ symbols with the same spelling as MASM reserved words (regardless of case). MASM reserved words include instruction names such as **PUSH** and register names such as SI.

- Structure and union tags are not recognized in `__asm` blocks.

**END Microsoft Specific**
