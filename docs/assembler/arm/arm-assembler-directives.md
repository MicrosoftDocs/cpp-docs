# ARM Assembler Directives

For the most part, the Microsoft ARM assembler uses the ARM assembly language, which is documented in the [ARM Compiler armasm Reference Guide](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0802b/index.html). However, the Microsoft implementations of some assembly directives differ from the ARM assembly directives. This article explains the differences.

## Microsoft Implementations of ARM Assembly Directives

- AREA

   The Microsoft ARM assembler supports these `AREA` attributes: `ALIGN`, `CODE`, `CODEALIGN`, `DATA`, `NOINIT`, `READONLY`, `READWRITE`, `THUMB`, `ARM`.

   All except `THUMB` and `ARM` work as documented in the [ARM Compiler armasm Reference Guide](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0802b/index.html).

   In the Microsoft ARM assembler, `THUMB` indicates that a `CODE` section contains Thumb code, and is the default for `CODE` sections.  `ARM` indicates that the section contains ARM code.

- ATTR

   Not supported.

- CODE16

   Not supported because it implies pre-UAL Thumb syntax, which the Microsoft ARM assembler does not allow.  Use the `THUMB` directive instead, along with UAL syntax.

- COMMON

   Specification of an alignment for the common region is not supported.

- DCDO

   Not supported.

- `DN`, `QN`, `SN`

   Specification of a type or a lane on the register alias is not supported.

- ENTRY

   Not supported.

- EQU

   Specification of a type for the defined symbol is not supported.

- `EXPORT` and `GLOBAL`

   Specifies exports using this syntax:

   > **EXPORT**|**GLOBAL** <em>sym</em>{**[**<em>type</em>**]**}

   *sym* is the symbol to be exported.  [*type*], if specified, can be either `[DATA]` to indicate that the symbol points to data or `[FUNC]` to indicate that the symbol points to code. `GLOBAL` is a synonym for `EXPORT`.

- EXPORTAS

   Not supported.

- FRAME

   Not supported.

- `FUNCTION` and `PROC`

   Although the assembly syntax supports the specification of a custom calling convention on procedures by listing the registers that are caller-save and those that are callee-save, the Microsoft ARM assembler accepts the syntax but ignores the register lists.  The debug information that is produced by the assembler supports only the default calling convention.

- `IMPORT` and `EXTERN`

   Specifies imports using this syntax:

   > **IMPORT**|**EXTERN** *sym*{**, WEAK** *alias*{**, TYPE** *t*}}

   *sym* is the name of the symbol to be imported.

   If `WEAK` *alias* is specified, it indicates that *sym* is a weak external. If no definition for it is found at link time, then all references to it bind instead to *alias*.

   If `TYPE` *t* is specified, then *t* indicates how the linker should attempt to resolve *sym*.  These values for *t* are possible:

   |Value|Description|
   |-|-|
   |1|Do not perform a library search for *sym*|
   |2|Perform a library search for *sym*|
   |3|*sym* is an alias for *alias* (default)|

   `EXTERN` is a synonym for `IMPORT`, except that *sym* is imported only if there are references to it in the current assembly.

- MACRO

   The use of a variable to hold the condition code of a macro is not supported. Default values for macro parameters are not supported.

- NOFP

   Not supported.

- `OPT`, `TTL`, `SUBT`

   Not supported because the Microsoft ARM assembler does not produce listings.

- PRESERVE8

   Not supported.

- RELOC

   `RELOC n` can only follow an instruction or a data definition directive. There is no "anonymous symbol" that can be relocated.

- REQUIRE

   Not supported.

- REQUIRE8

   Not supported.

- THUMBX

   Not supported because the Microsoft ARM assembler does not support the Thumb-2EE instruction set.
