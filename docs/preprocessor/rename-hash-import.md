# rename (\#import)

**C++ Specific**

Works around name collision problems.

## Syntax

```
rename("OldName","NewName")
```

### Parameters

*OldName*<br/>
Old name in the type library.

*NewName*<br/>
Name to be used instead of the old name.

## Remarks

If this attribute is specified, the compiler replaces all occurrences of *OldName* in a type library with the user-supplied *NewName* in the resulting header files.

This attribute can be used when a name in the type library coincides with a macro definition in the system header files. If this situation is not resolved, then various syntax errors will be generated, such as [Compiler Error C2059](../error-messages/compiler-errors-1/compiler-error-c2059.md) and [Compiler Error C2061](../error-messages/compiler-errors-1/compiler-error-c2061.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The replacement is for a name used in the type library, not for a name used in the resulting header file.

For example, suppose a property named `MyParent` exists in a type library, and a macro `GetMyParent` is defined in a header file and used before `#import`. Since `GetMyParent` is the default name of a wrapper function for the error-handling `get` property, a name collision will occur. To work around the problem, use the following attribute in the `#import` statement:

```cpp
rename("MyParent","MyParentX")
```

which renames the name `MyParent` in the type library. An attempt to rename the `GetMyParent` wrapper name will fail:

```cpp
rename("GetMyParent","GetMyParentX")
```

This is because the name `GetMyParent` only occurs in the resulting type library header file.
