# raw_native_types
**C++ Specific**  
  
Disables the use of COM support classes in the high-level wrapper functions and forces the use of low-level data types instead.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
raw_native_types  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 
By default, the high-level error-handling methods use the COM support classes [_bstr_t](../cpp/bstr-t-class.md) and [_variant_t](../cpp/variant-t-class.md) in place of the `BSTR` and `VARIANT` data types and raw COM interface pointers. These classes encapsulate the details of allocating and deallocating memory storage for these data types, and greatly simplify type casting and conversion operations.
