# C/C++ Preprocessor Reference
The *C/C++ Preprocessor Reference* explains the preprocessor as it is implemented in Microsoft C/C++. The preprocessor performs preliminary operations on C and C++ files before they are passed to the compiler. You can use the preprocessor to conditionally compile code, insert files, specify compile-time error messages, and apply machine-specific rules to sections of code.  
  
## In This Section  
 
[Preprocessor Directives](../preprocessor/preprocessor-directives.md)  
Describes directives, typically used to make source programs easy to change and easy to compile in different execution environments.  
  
[Preprocessor Operators](../preprocessor/preprocessor-operators.md)  
Discusses the four preprocessor-specific operators used in the context of the `#define` directive.  
  
[Predefined Macros](../preprocessor/predefined-macros.md)  
Discusses predefined macros as specified by ANSI and Microsoft C++.  
  
[Pragmas](../preprocessor/pragma-directives-and-the-pragma-keyword.md)  
Discusses pragmas, which offer a way for each compiler to offer machine- and operating system-specific features while retaining overall compatibility with the C and C++ languages.
