# bss_seg
Specifies the segment where uninitialized variables are stored in the .obj file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#pragma bss_seg( [ [ { push | pop }, ] [ identifier, ] ] [ "segment-name" [, "segment-class" ] )  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 
Obj files can be viewed with the [dumpbin](../build/reference/dumpbin-command-line.md) application. The default segment in the .obj file for uninitialized data is .bss. In some cases use of **bss_seg** can speed load times by grouping uninitialized data into one section.  
  
**bss_seg** with no parameters resets the segment to .bss.  
  
*push* (optional)  
Puts a record on the internal compiler stack. A *push* can have an *identifier* and *segment-name*.  
  
*pop* (optional)  
Removes a record from the top of the internal compiler stack.  
  
*identifier* (optional)  
When used with *push*, assigns a name to the record on the internal compiler stack. When used with *pop*, pops records off the internal stack until *identifier* is removed; if *identifier* is not found on the internal stack, nothing is popped.  
  
*identifier* enables multiple records to be popped with a single *pop* command.  
  
*"segment-name"*(optional)  
The name of a segment. When used with *pop*, the stack is popped and *segment-name* becomes the active segment name.  
  
*"segment-class"* (optional)  
Included for compatibility with C++ prior to version 2.0. It is ignored.  
  
## Example  
  
```cpp  
// pragma_directive_bss_seg.cpp  
int i;                     // stored in .bss  
#pragma bss_seg(".my_data1")  
int j;                     // stored in "my_data1"  
  
#pragma bss_seg(push, stack1, ".my_data2")     
int l;                     // stored in "my_data2"  
  
#pragma bss_seg(pop, stack1)   // pop stack1 from stack  
int m;                     // stored in "stack_data1"  
  
int main() {  
}  
```  
  
You can also specify sections for initialized data ([data_seg](../preprocessor/data-seg.md)), functions ([code_seg](../preprocessor/code-seg.md)), and const variables ([const_seg](../preprocessor/const-seg.md)).  
  
Data allocated using the **bss_seg** pragma does not retain any information about its location.  
  
See [/SECTION](../build/reference/section-specify-section-attributes.md) for a list of names you should not use when creating a section.
