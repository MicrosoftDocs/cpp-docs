# Conventions
The conventions use different font attributes for different components of the syntax. The symbols and fonts are as follows:

|Attribute|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|*nonterminal*|Italic type indicates nonterminals.|
|#include|Terminals in bold type are literal reserved words and symbols that must be entered as shown. Characters in this context are always case sensitive.|
|opt|Nonterminals followed by <sub>opt</sub> are always optional.|
|default typeface|Characters in the set described or listed in this typeface can be used as terminals in statements.|

A colon (**:**) following a nonterminal introduces its definition. Alternative definitions are listed on separate lines.
