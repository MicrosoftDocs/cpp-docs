# no_implementation
**C++ Specific**

Suppresses the generation of the .tli header, which contains the implementations of the wrapper member functions.

## Syntax

```
no_implementation
```

## Remarks

If this attribute is specified, the .tlh header, with the declarations to expose type-library items, will be generated without an `#include` statement to include the .tli header file.

This attribute is used in conjunction with [implementation_only](../preprocessor/implementation-only.md).
