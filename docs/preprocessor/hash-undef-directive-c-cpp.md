# #undef Directive (C/C++)
Removes (undefines) a name previously created with `#define`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#undef   
identifier  
```  
  
## Remarks 

The **#undef** directive removes the current definition of *identifier*. Consequently, subsequent occurrences of *identifier* are ignored by the preprocessor. To remove a macro definition using **#undef**, give only the macro *identifier* ; do not give a parameter list.  
  
You can also apply the **#undef** directive to an identifier that has no previous definition. This ensures that the identifier is undefined. Macro replacement is not performed within **#undef** statements.  
  
The **#undef** directive is typically paired with a `#define` directive to create a region in a source program in which an identifier has a special meaning. For example, a specific function of the source program can use manifest constants to define environment-specific values that do not affect the rest of the program. The **#undef** directive also works with the `#if` directive to control conditional compilation of the source program. See [The #if, #elif, #else, and #endif Directives](../preprocessor/hash-if-hash-elif-hash-else-and-hash-endif-directives-c-cpp.md) for more information.  
  
In the following example, the **#undef** directive removes definitions of a symbolic constant and a macro. Note that only the identifier of the macro is given.  
  
```  
#define WIDTH 80  
#define ADD( X, Y ) ((X) + (Y))  
.  
.  
.  
#undef WIDTH  
#undef ADD  
```  
  
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
Macros can be undefined from the command line using the `/U` option, followed by the macro names to be undefined. The effect of issuing this command is equivalent to a sequence of `#undef` *macro-name* statements at the beginning of the file.
