# pointers_to_members
**C++ Specific**  
  
Specifies whether a pointer to a class member can be declared before its associated class definition and is used to control the pointer size and the code required to interpret the pointer.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```    
#pragma pointers_to_members( pointer-declaration, [most-general-representation] )  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 
You can place a **pointers_to_members** pragma in your source file as an alternative to using the [/vmx](../build/reference/vmb-vmg-representation-method.md) compiler options or the [inheritance keywords](../cpp/inheritance-keywords.md).  
  
The *pointer-declaration* argument specifies whether you have declared a pointer to a member before or after the associated function definition. The *pointer-declaration* argument is one of the following two symbols:  
  
|Argument|Comments|  
|--------------|--------------|  
|*full_generality*|Generates safe, sometimes nonoptimal code. You use *full_generality* if any pointer to a member is declared before the associated class definition. This argument always uses the pointer representation specified by the *most-general-representation* argument. Equivalent to /vmg.|  
|*best_case*|Generates safe, optimal code using best-case representation for all pointers to members. Requires defining the class before declaring a pointer to a member of the class. The default is *best_case*.|  
  
The *most-general-representation* argument specifies the smallest pointer representation that the compiler can safely use to reference any pointer to a member of a class in a translation unit. The argument can be one of the following:  
  
|Argument|Comments|  
|--------------|--------------|  
|*single_inheritance*|The most general representation is single-inheritance, pointer to a member function. Causes an error if the inheritance model of a class definition for which a pointer to a member is declared is ever either multiple or virtual.|  
|*multiple_inheritance*|The most general representation is multiple-inheritance, pointer to a member function. Causes an error if the inheritance model of a class definition for which a pointer to a member is declared is virtual.|  
|*virtual_inheritance*|The most general representation is virtual-inheritance, pointer to a member function. Never causes an error. This is the default argument when `#pragma pointers_to_members(full_generality)` is used.|  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> We advise you to put the **pointers_to_members** pragma only in the source code file that you want to affect, and only after any `#include` directives. This practice lessens the risk that the pragma will affect other files, and that you will accidently specify multiple definitions for the same variable, function, or class name.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
//   Specify single-inheritance only  
#pragma pointers_to_members( full_generality, single_inheritance )  
```
