# setlocale
Defines the locale (Country/Region and language) to be used when translating wide-character constants and string literals.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#pragma setlocale( "[locale-string]" )  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 
Because the algorithm for converting multibyte characters to wide characters may vary by locale or the compilation may take place in a different locale from where an executable file will be run, this pragma provides a way to specify the target locale at compile time. This guarantees that the wide-character strings will be stored in the correct format.  
  
The default *locale-string* is "".  
  
The "C" locale maps each character in the string to its value as a **wchar_t** (unsigned short). Other values that are valid for `setlocale` are those entries that are found in the [Language Strings](../c-runtime-library/language-strings.md) list. For example, you could issue:  
  
```  
#pragma setlocale("dutch")  
```  
  
The ability to issue a language string depends on the code page and language ID support on your computer.
