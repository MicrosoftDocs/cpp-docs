# Compiler warnings that are off by default

The compiler supports warnings that are turned off by default, because most developers don't find them useful. In some cases, they warn about a stylistic choice, or about common idioms in older code. Other warnings are about use of a Microsoft extension to the language. Some warnings indicate an area where programmers often make incorrect assumptions, which may lead to unexpected or undefined behavior. If all of these warnings are enabled, some of them may appear many times in library headers. The C runtime libraries and the C++ standard libraries are intended to emit no warnings only at warning level [`/W4`](../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md).

## Enable warnings that are off by default

You can enable warnings that are normally off by default by using one of the following options:

- **`#pragma warning(default :`** *warning_number* **`)`**

   The specified warning (*warning_number*) is enabled at its default level. Documentation for the warning contains the default level of the warning.

- **`#pragma warning(`** *warning_level* **`:`** *warning_number* **`)`**

   The specified warning (*warning_number*) is enabled at the specified level (*warning_level*).

- [`/Wall`](../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md)

   `/Wall` enables all warnings that are off by default. If you use this option, you can turn off individual warnings by using the [`/wd`](../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md) option.

- [`/wL`*nnnn*](../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md)

   This option enables warning *nnnn* at level *L*.
