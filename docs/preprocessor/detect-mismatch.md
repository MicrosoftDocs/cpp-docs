# detect_mismatch
Places a record in an object. The linker checks these records for potential mismatches.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#pragma detect_mismatch( "name", "value"))  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 
When you link the project, the linker throws a `LNK2038` error if the project contains two objects that have the same `name` but each has a different `value`. Use this pragma to prevent inconsistent object files from linking.  
  
Both name and value are string literals and obey the rules for string literals with respect to escape characters and concatenation. They are case-sensitive and cannot contain a comma, equal sign, quotation marks, or the **null** character.  
  
## Example  
 
This example creates two files that have different version numbers for the same version label.  
  
```cpp  
// pragma_directive_detect_mismatch_a.cpp  
#pragma detect_mismatch("myLib_version", "9")  
int main ()  
{  
   return 0;  
}  
  
// pragma_directive_detect_mismatch_b.cpp  
#pragma detect_mismatch("myLib_version", "1")  
```  
  
If you compile both of these files by using the command line `cl pragma_directive_detect_mismatch_a.cpp pragma_directive_detect_mismatch_b.cpp`, you will receive the error `LNK2038`.
