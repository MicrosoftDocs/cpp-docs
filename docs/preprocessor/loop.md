# loop
Controls how loop code is to be considered by the auto-parallelizer, and/or excludes a loop from consideration by the auto-vectorizer.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#pragma loop( hint_parallel(n) )  
```  
  
```  
#pragma loop( no_vector )  
```  
  
```  
#pragma loop( ivdep )  
```  
  
### Parameters  
*hint_parallel(n)*  
Hints to the compiler that this loop should be parallelized across *n* threads, where *n* is a positive integer literal or zero. If *n* is zero, the maximum number of threads is used at run time. This is a hint to the compiler, not a command, and there is no guarantee that the loop will be parallelized. If the loop has data dependencies, or structural issues—for example, the loop stores to a scalar that's used beyond the loop body—then the loop will not be parallelized.  
  
The compiler ignores this option unless the [/Qpar](../build/reference/qpar-auto-parallelizer.md) compiler switch is specified.  
  
*no_vector*  
By default, the auto-vectorizer is on and will attempt to vectorize all loops that it evaluates as benefitting from it. Specify this pragma to disable the auto-vectorizer for the loop that follows it.  
  
*ivdep*  
Hints to the compiler to ignore vector dependencies for this loop. Use this in conjunction with *hint_parallel*.  
  
## Remarks  
 
To use the **loop** pragma, place it immediately before—not in—a loop definition. The pragma takes effect for the scope of the loop that follows it. You can apply multiple pragmas to a loop, in any order, but you must state each one in a separate pragma statement.
