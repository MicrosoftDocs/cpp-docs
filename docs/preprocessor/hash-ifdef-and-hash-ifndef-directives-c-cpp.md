# #ifdef and #ifndef Directives (C/C++)
The **#ifdef** and **#ifndef** directives perform the same task as the `#if` directive when it is used with **defined**( *identifier* ).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#ifdef identifier  
#ifndef identifier  
  
// equivalent to  
#if defined identifier  
#if !defined identifier  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 
You can use the **#ifdef** and **#ifndef** directives anywhere `#if` can be used. The **#ifdef** *identifier* statement is equivalent to `#if 1` when *identifier* has been defined, and it is equivalent to `#if 0` when *identifier* has not been defined or has been undefined with the `#undef` directive. These directives check only for the presence or absence of identifiers defined with `#define`, not for identifiers declared in the C or C++ source code.  
  
These directives are provided only for compatibility with previous versions of the language. The **defined(** *identifier* **)** constant expression used with the `#if` directive is preferred.  
  
The **#ifndef** directive checks for the opposite of the condition checked by **#ifdef**. If the identifier has not been defined (or its definition has been removed with `#undef`), the condition is true (nonzero). Otherwise, the condition is false (0).  
  
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
The *identifier* can be passed from the command line using the `/D` option. Up to 30 macros can be specified with `/D`.  
  
This is useful for checking whether a definition exists, because a definition can be passed from the command line. For example:  
  
```cpp  
// ifdef_ifndef.CPP  
// compile with: /Dtest /c  
#ifndef test  
#define final  
#endif  
```  
  
**END Microsoft Specific**
