# Configure Visual C++ for ARM processors

This section of the documentation contains information about how to use the Visual C++ build tools to target ARM hardware.  
  
## In This Section  

[Overview of ARM ABI Conventions](../build/overview-of-arm-abi-conventions.md)  
Describes the application binary interface used by Windows on ARM for register usage, calling conventions and exception handling.  
  
[Overview of ARM64 ABI Conventions](../build/arm64-windows-abi-conventions.md)  
Describes the application binary interface used by Windows on ARM64 for register usage, calling conventions and exception handling.  
  
[Common Visual C++ ARM Migration Issues](../build/common-visual-cpp-arm-migration-issues.md)  
Describes C++ code elements that are commonly assumed to be portable across architectures, but which produce different results for ARM than for x86 and x64.  
  
[ARM Exception Handling](../build/arm-exception-handling.md)  
Describes the encoding scheme for stack unwinding during structured exception handling in Windows on ARM.  

[ARM64 Exception Handling](../build/arm64-exception-handling.md)  
Describes the encoding scheme for stack unwinding during structured exception handling in Windows on ARM64.  

## Related Sections  
  
[ARM Intrinsics](../intrinsics/arm-intrinsics.md)  
Describes compiler intrinsics for processors that use the ARM architecture.
