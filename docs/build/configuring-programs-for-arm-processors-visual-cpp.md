# Configure C++ projects for ARM processors

This section of the documentation contains information about how to use the MSVC build tools to target ARM hardware.

## In This Section

[Overview of ARM ABI conventions](overview-of-arm-abi-conventions.md)\
Describes the application binary interface used by Windows on ARM for register usage, calling conventions and exception handling.

[Overview of ARM64 ABI conventions](arm64-windows-abi-conventions.md)\
Describes the application binary interface used by Windows on ARM64 for register usage, calling conventions and exception handling.

[Common MSVC ARM migration issues](common-visual-cpp-arm-migration-issues.md)\
Describes C++ code elements that are commonly assumed to be portable across architectures, but that produce different results for ARM than for x86 and x64.

[ARM exception handling](arm-exception-handling.md)\
Describes the encoding scheme for stack unwinding during structured exception handling in Windows on ARM.

[ARM64 exception handling](arm64-exception-handling.md)\
Describes the encoding scheme for stack unwinding during structured exception handling in Windows on ARM64.
