# Unwind Helpers for MASM
In order to write proper assembly routines, there are a set of pseudo-operations that can be used in parallel with the actual assembly instructions to create the appropriate .pdata and .xdata. There are also a set of macros that provide simplified use of the pseudo-operations for their most common uses.  
  
## Remarks  
 The following topics are in this section:  
  
-   [Raw Pseudo Operations](../build/raw-pseudo-operations.md)  
  
-   [MASM Macros](../build/masm-macros.md)
