# Walkthrough: Using MSBuild to Create a Visual C++ Project

This walkthrough demonstrates how to use MSBuild to build a Visual C++ project at a command prompt. You will learn how to create the C++ source files and an XML-based project file for a Visual C++ console application. After building the project, you will learn how to customize the build process.

This walkthrough illustrates the following tasks:

- Creating the C++ source files for your project.

- Creating the XML MSBuild project file.

- Using MSBuild to build your project.

- Using MSBuild to customize your project.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to complete this walkthrough:

- A copy of Visual Studio with the **Desktop development with C++** workload installed.

- A general understanding of the MSBuild system.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not use this approach if you intend to edit the project file later by using the Visual Studio IDE. If you create a .vcxproj file manually, the Visual Studio IDE might not be able to edit or load it, especially if the project uses wildcards in project items.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the low-level build instructions are contained in the **.targets** and **.props** files that are defined in the VCTargets directory, stored in the property `$(VCTargetsPath)`. The default path for these files in Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise Edition is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\Common7\\IDE\\VC\\VCTargets\\.

## Creating the C++ Source Files

In this walkthrough you will create a project that has a source file and a header file. The source file main.cpp contains the main function for the console application. The header file main.h contains code to include the iostream header file. You can create these C++ files by using Visual Studio or a text editor such as Visual Studio Code.

### To create the C++ source files for your project

1. Create a directory for your project.

2. Create a file that is named main.cpp and add the following code to this file:

    ```cpp
    // main.cpp : the application source code.
    #include <iostream>
    #include "main.h"
    int main()
    {
       std::cout << "Hello, from MSBuild!\n";
       return 0;
    }
    ```

3. Create a file that is named main.h and add the following code to this file:

    ```cpp
    // main.h: the application header code.
    /* Additional source code to include. */
    ```

## Creating the XML MSBuild Project File

An MSBuild project file is an XML file that contains a project root element (\<Project>). In the following example project, the \<Project> element contains seven child elements:

- Three item group tags (\<ItemGroup>) that specify project configuration and platform, source file name, and header file name.

- Three import tags (\<Import>) that specify the location of Microsoft Visual C++ settings.

- A property group tag (\<PropertyGroup>) that specifies project settings.

### To create the MSBuild project file

1. Use a text editor to create a project file that is named `myproject.vcxproj`, and then add the following root \<Project> element. Insert the elements in the following procedure steps between the root \<Project> tags:

    ```xml
    <Project DefaultTargets="Build" ToolsVersion="15.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
    </Project>
    ```

2. Add the following two \<ProjectConfiguration> child elements in an \<ItemGroup> element. The child element specifies debug and release configurations for a 32-bit Windows operating system:

    ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
      <ProjectConfiguration Include="Debug|Win32">
        <Configuration>Debug</Configuration>
        <Platform>Win32</Platform>
      </ProjectConfiguration>
      <ProjectConfiguration Include="Release|Win32">
        <Configuration>Release</Configuration>
        <Platform>Win32</Platform>
      </ProjectConfiguration>
    </ItemGroup>
    ```

3. Add the following \<Import/> element that specifies the path of the default C++ settings for this project:

    ```xml
    <Import Project="$(VCTargetsPath)\Microsoft.Cpp.default.props" />
    ```

4. Add the following property group element (\<PropertyGroup>) that specifies two project properties:

    ```xml
    <PropertyGroup>
      <ConfigurationType>Application</ConfigurationType>
      <PlatformToolset>v141</PlatformToolset>
    </PropertyGroup>
    ```

5. Add the following \<Import/> element that specifies the path of the current C++ settings for this project:

    ```xml
    <Import Project="$(VCTargetsPath)\Microsoft.Cpp.props" />
    ```

6. Add the following \<ClCompile> child element in an \<ItemGroup> element. The child element specifies the name of the C/C++ source file to compile:

    ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
      <ClCompile Include="main.cpp" />
    </ItemGroup>
    ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > \<ClCompile> is a *build target* and is defined in the **VCTargets** directory.

7. Add the following \<ClInclude> child element in an \<ItemGroup> element. The child element specifies the name of the header file for the C/C++ source file:

    ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
      <ClInclude Include="main.h" />
    </ItemGroup>
    ```

8. Add the following \<Import> element that specifies the path of the file that defines the target for this project:

    ```xml
    <Import Project="$(VCTargetsPath)\Microsoft.Cpp.Targets" />
    ```

### Complete Project File

The following code shows the complete project file that you created in the previous procedure.

```xml
<Project DefaultTargets="Build" ToolsVersion="15.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectConfiguration Include="Debug|Win32">
      <Configuration>Debug</Configuration>
      <Platform>Win32</Platform>
    </ProjectConfiguration>
    <ProjectConfiguration Include="Release|Win32">
      <Configuration>Release</Configuration>
      <Platform>Win32</Platform>
    </ProjectConfiguration>
  </ItemGroup>
  <Import Project="$(VCTargetsPath)\Microsoft.Cpp.default.props" />
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ConfigurationType>Application</ConfigurationType>
    <PlatformToolset>v141</PlatformToolset>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <Import Project="$(VCTargetsPath)\Microsoft.Cpp.props" />
  <ItemGroup>
    <ClCompile Include="main.cpp" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <ClInclude Include="main.h" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <Import Project="$(VCTargetsPath)\Microsoft.Cpp.Targets" />
</Project>
```

## Using MSBuild to Build Your Project

Type the following command at the command prompt to build your console application:

`msbuild myproject.vcxproj /p:configuration=debug`

MSBuild creates a directory for the output files, and then compiles and links your project to generate the Myproject.exe program. After the build process finishes, use the following command to run the application:

`myproject`

The application should display "Hello, from MSBuild!" in the console window.

## Customizing Your Project

MSBuild enables you to execute predefined build targets, apply user-defined properties, and use custom tools, events, and build steps. This section illustrates the following tasks:

- Using MSBuild with build targets.

- Using MSBuild with build properties.

- Using MSBuild with the 64-bit compiler and tools.

- Using MSBuild with different toolsets.

- Adding MSBuild customizations.

### Using MSBuild with Build Targets

A *build target* is a named set of predefined or user-defined commands that can be executed during the build. Use the target command-line option (**/t**) to specify a build target. In the case of the `myproject` example project, the predefined **clean** target deletes all files in the debug folder and creates a new log file.

At the command prompt, type the following command to clean `myproject`.

`msbuild myproject.vcxproj /t:clean`

### Using MSBuild with Build Properties

The property command-line option (**/p**) enables you to override a property in your project build file. In the `myproject` example project, the release or debug build configuration is specified by the `Configuration` property. And the operating system that is intended to run the built application is specified by the `Platform` property.

At the command prompt, type the following command to create a debug build of the `myproject` application that is intended to run on 32-bit Windows.

`msbuild myproject.vcxproj /p:configuration=debug /p:platform=win32`

Assume that the `myproject` example project also defines a configuration for 64-bit Windows, and another configuration for a custom operating system named `myplatform`.

At the command prompt, type the following command to create a release build that runs on 64-bit Windows.

`msbuild myproject.vcxproj /p:configuration=release /p:platform=x64`

At the command prompt, type the following command to create a release build for `myplatform`.

`msbuild myproject.vcxproj /p:configuration=release /p:platform=myplatform`

### Using MSBuild with the 64-bit Compiler and Tools

If you have installed Visual C++ on 64-bit Windows, by default, the 64-bit x64 native and cross tools are installed. You can configure MSBuild to use the 64-bit compiler and tools to build your application by setting the `PreferredToolArchitecture` property. This property does not affect the project configuration or platform properties. By default, the 32-bit version of the tools is used. To specify the 64-bit version of the compiler and tools, add the following property group element to the Myproject.vcxproj project file after the `Microsoft.Cpp.default.props` \<Import /> element:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PreferredToolArchitecture>x64</PreferredToolArchitecture>
</PropertyGroup>
```

At the command prompt, type the following command to use the 64-bit tools to build your application.

`msbuild myproject.vcxproj /p:PreferredToolArchitecture=x64`

### Using MSBuild with a different toolset

If you have the toolsets and libraries for other versions of Visual C++ installed, MSBuild can build applications for either the current Visual C++ version or for the other installed versions. For example, if you have installed [!INCLUDE[cpp_dev11_long](../build/includes/cpp_dev11_long_md.md)], to specify the Visual C++ 11.0 toolset for Windows XP, add the following property group element to the Myproject.vcxproj project file after the Microsoft.Cpp.props `<Import />` element:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PlatformToolset>v110_xp</PlatformToolset>
</PropertyGroup>
```

To rebuild your project with the Visual C++ 11.0 Windows XP toolset, type either of the following commands:

`msbuild myproject.vcxproj /p:PlatformToolset=v110_xp /t:rebuild`

`msbuild myproject.vcxproj /t:rebuild`

### Adding MSBuild customizations

MSBuild provides various ways to customize your build process. The following topics show how to add custom build steps, tools, and events to your MSBuild project:
