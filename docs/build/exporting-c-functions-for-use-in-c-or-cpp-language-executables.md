# Exporting C Functions for Use in C or C++ Language Executables  
  
If you have functions in a DLL written in C that you want to access from a C language or C++ language module, you should use the **__cplusplus** preprocessor macro to determine which language is being compiled, and then declare these functions with C linkage if being used from a C++ language module. If you use this technique and provide header files for your DLL, these functions can be used by C and C++ users with no change.  
  
The following code shows a header file that can be used by C and C++ client applications:  
  
```h  
// MyCFuncs.h  
#ifdef __cplusplus  
extern "C" {  // only need to export C interface if  
              // used by C++ source code  
#endif  
  
__declspec( dllimport ) void MyCFunc();  
__declspec( dllimport ) void AnotherCFunc();  
  
#ifdef __cplusplus  
}  
#endif  
```  
  
If you need to link C functions to your C++ executable and the function declaration header files have not used the above technique, in the C++ source file, do the following to prevent the compiler from decorating the C function names:  
  
```cpp  
extern "C" {  
#include "MyCHeader.h"  
}  
```
