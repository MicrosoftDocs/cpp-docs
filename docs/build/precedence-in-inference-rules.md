# Precedence in Inference Rules

If an inference rule is multiply defined, NMAKE uses the highest-precedence definition. The following list shows the order of precedence from highest to lowest:

1. An inference rule defined in a makefile; later definitions have precedence.

1. An inference rule defined in Tools.ini; later definitions have precedence.

1. A predefined inference rule.
