# Precedence in Inference Rules
If an inference rule is multiply defined, NMAKE uses the highest-precedence definition. The following list shows the order of precedence from highest to lowest:  
  
1.  An inference rule defined in a makefile; later definitions have precedence.  
  
2.  An inference rule defined in Tools.ini; later definitions have precedence.  
  
3.  A predefined inference rule.
