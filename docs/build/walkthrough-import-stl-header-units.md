# Walkthrough: Import STL libraries as header units

This walkthrough shows how to import C++ Standard Template Library (STL) libraries as header units in Visual Studio. For an even faster and more robust way to import the standard library, see [Tutorial: Import the C++ standard library using modules](../cpp/tutorial-import-stl-named-module.md).

Importing an STL header as a header unit is simpler than using [precompiled header files](creating-precompiled-header-files.md). Header units are easier to set up and use, are substantially smaller on disk, provide similar performance benefits, and are more flexible than a [shared PCH](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/shared-pch-usage-sample-in-visual-studio).

For more detailed information about what header units are and the benefits they provide, see [What is a header unit?](walkthrough-header-units.md#what-is-a-header-unit). To contrast header units with other ways to import the standard library, see [Compare header units, modules, and precompiled headers](compare-inclusion-methods.md).

## Prerequisites

To use header units, use Visual Studio 2022 or later, or Visual Studio 2019 version 16.11 or later. The [`/std:c++20`](./reference/std-specify-language-standard-version.md) option (or later) is required to use header units.

## Two approaches to import STL headers as header units

Before you can import an STL header, it must be compiled into a header unit. A header unit is a binary representation of a header file. It has an *`.ifc`* extension.

The recommended approach is to create a static library that contains the built header units for the STL headers you want to use. Then reference that library and `import` its header units. This approach can result in faster builds and better reuse. To try out this approach, see [Approach 1: Create a static library of STL library header units](#approach1).

Another approach is to have Visual Studio scan for the STL headers you `#include` in your project, compile them into header units, and `import` rather than `#include` those headers. This approach is useful if you have a large codebase, because you don't have to change your source code. This approach is less flexible than the static library approach, because it doesn't lend itself to reusing the built header units in other projects. But, you still get the performance advantage of importing individual STL libraries as header units. To try out this approach, see [Approach 2: Scan includes for STL headers to import](#approach2).

## <a name="approach1"></a>Approach 1: Create a static library of STL library header units

The recommended way to consume STL libraries as header units is to create one or more static library projects. These projects should consist of the STL library header units that you want to use. Then, reference the library projects to consume those STL header units. It's similar to using [shared precompiled headers](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/shared-pch-usage-sample-in-visual-studio/), but easier.

Header units (and modules) built in a static library project are automatically available to referencing projects because the project system automatically adds the appropriate [`/headerUnit`](./reference/headerunit.md) command-line option to the compiler so that referencing projects can import the header units.

This approach ensures that the header unit for a particular header is built only once. It allows you to import some or all of the header units, which isn't possible with a PCH. You can include header units in any order.

In the following example, you create a static library project consisting of the `<iostream>` and `<vector>` header units. After the solution is built, you'll reference this shared header unit project from another C++ project. Everywhere `import <iostream>;` or `import <vector>;` is found, the built header unit for that library is used instead of translating the header with the preprocessor. It improves build performance, like PCH files do, when the same header is included in multiple files. The header won't have to be processed over and over by the files that include it. Instead, the already processed compiled header unit is imported.

To create a static library that contains the STL libraries `<iostream>` and `<vector>`, follow these steps:

1. Create an empty C++ project. Name it *SharedPrj*.\
 Select **Empty Project** for C++ from the project types available in the **Create a new project** window:
:::image type="content" source="media/empty-project-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows creating a new empty C++ project.":::
1. Add a new C++ file to the project. Change the file's content to:

    ```cpp
    import <iostream>;
    import <vector>;
    ```

### Set project properties

Set project properties to share the header units from this project:

1. On the Visual Studio main menu, select **Project** > **SharedPrj Properties** to open the project Property Pages dialog:
:::image type="content" source="media/set-header-unit-library-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows settings for Configuration Type and C++ Language Standard.":::
1. Select **All Configurations** in the **Configuration** dropdown list, and then select **All Platforms** in the **Platform** dropdown list. These settings ensure that your changes apply whether you're building for debug or release.
1. In the left pane of the project Property Pages dialog, select **Configuration Properties** > **General**.
1. Change the **Configuration Type** option to **Static library (.lib)**.
1. Change **C++ Language Standard** to **ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++20)** (or later).
1. In the left pane of the project Property Pages dialog, select **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **General**.
1. In the **Scan Sources for Module Dependencies** dropdown list, select **Yes**. (This option causes the compiler to scan your code for dependencies that can be built into header units):
:::image type="content" source="media/vs2019-scan-module-dependencies.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the scan module dependencies property setting.":::
1. Choose **OK** to close the project Property Pages dialog. Build the solution by selecting **Build** > **Build Solution** on the main menu.

### Reference the header unit library

To import `<iostream>` and `<vector>` as header units from the static library, create a project that references the static library as follows:

1. With the current solution still open, on the Visual Studio menu, select **File** > **Add**  > **New Project**.
1. In the **Create a new project** wizard, select the C++ **Console App** template and choose **Next**.
1. Name the new project *Walkthrough*. Change the **Solution** dropdown to **Add to solution**. Choose **Create** to create the project and add it to your solution.
1. Change the content of the *Walkthrough.cpp* source file as follows:

    ```cpp
    import <iostream>;
    import <vector>;
    
    int main()
    {
        std::vector<int> numbers = {0, 1, 2};
        std::cout << numbers[1];
    }
    ```

Header units require the [`/std:c++20`](./reference/std-specify-language-standard-version.md) option (or later). Set the language standard by using the following steps:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Walkthrough** project and select **Properties** to open the project Property Pages dialog:
:::image type="content" source="media/set-cpp-language-latest.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows setting the language standard to the preview version.":::
1. In the left pane of the **Walkthrough** project Property Pages dialog, select **Configuration Properties** > **General**.
1. In the **C++ Language Standard** dropdown, select **ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++20)** (or later).
1. Choose **OK** to close the project Property Pages dialog.

In the **Walkthrough** project, add a reference to the **SharedPrj** project with the following steps:

1. In the **Walkthrough** project, select the **References** node, and then select **Add Reference**. Select **SharedPrj** in the list of projects:
:::image type="content" source="./media/add-reference-to-walkthrough.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Add Reference dialog. It's used to add a reference to the Walkthrough project.":::
Adding this reference causes the build system to use the header units built by **SharedPrj** whenever an `import` in the **Walkthrough** project matches one of the built header units in **SharedPrj**.
1. Choose **OK** to close the **Add Reference** dialog.
1. Right-click the **Walkthrough** project and select **Set as Startup Project**.
1. Build the solution. (Use **Build** > **Build Solution** on the main menu.) Run it to see that it produces the expected output: `1`

The advantage of this approach is that you can reference the static library project from any project to reuse the header units in it. In this example, the static library contains the `<vector>` and `<iostream>` header units.

You can make a monolithic static library project that contains all the commonly used STL headers that you want to import from your various projects. Or you can create smaller shared library projects for the different groupings of STL libraries that you want to import as header units. Then reference those shared header unit projects as needed.

The result should be increased build throughput because importing a header unit significantly reduces the work the compiler must do.

When you use this approach with your own projects, build the static library project with compiler options that are compatible with the project that references it. For example, STL projects should be built with the **`/EHsc`** compiler option to turn on exception handling, and so should the projects that reference the static library project.

### Use `/translateInclude`

The [`/translateInclude`](./reference/translateinclude.md) compiler option (available in the project Property Pages dialog under **C/C++** > **General** > **Translate Includes to Imports**) makes it easier for you to use a header unit library in older projects that `#include` the STL libraries. It makes it unnecessary to change `#include` directives to `import` in your project, while still giving you the advantage of importing the header units instead of including them.

For example, if you have `#include <vector>` in your project and you reference a static library that contains a header unit for `<vector>`, you don't need to manually change `#include <vector>` to `import <vector>;` in your source code. Instead, the compiler automatically treats `#include <vector>` as `import <vector>;`. For more information in detail on this approach, see [Approach 2: Scan includes for STL headers to import](#approach2). Not all STL header files can be compiled to a header unit. The `header-units.json` shipped with Visual Studio lists which STL header files can be compiled into header units. A header that relies on macros to specify its behavior often can't be compiled into a header unit.

An `#include` statement that doesn't refer to a header unit is treated as a normal `#include`.

### Reuse header units among projects

Header units built by a static library project are automatically available to all directly and indirectly referencing projects. There are project settings that allow you to select which header units should be automatically available to all referencing projects. The settings are in project settings under **VC++ Directories**.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and select **Properties** to open the project Property Pages dialog.
1. In the left pane of the dialog, select **Configuration Properties** > **VC++ Directories**:
:::image type="content" source="media/public-include-module-directories-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows public project content properties, like Public Include Directories and All Header Files are Public.":::

The following properties control the visibility of header units to the build system:

- **Public Include Directories** specifies project directories for header units that should be automatically added to the include path in referencing projects.
- **Public C++ Module Directories** specifies which project directories contain header units that should be available to referencing projects. This property allows you to make some header units public. It's visible to other projects, so put header units that you want to share here. If you use this setting, for convenience, specify **Public Include Directories** to automatically add your public headers to the Include path in referencing projects.
- **All Modules are Public**:  when you use header units built as a part of a DLL project, the symbols have to be exported from the DLL. To export module symbols automatically, set this property to **Yes**.

### Use a prebuilt module file

Typically, the easiest way to reuse header units among solutions is to reference a shared header unit project from each solution.

If you must use a built header unit that you don't have the project for, you can specify where the built *`.ifc`* file is so you can import it in your solution. To access this setting:

1. On the main menu, select **Project** > **Properties** to open the project Property Pages dialog.
1. In the left pane of the dialog, select **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **General**.
1. In **Additional Module Dependencies**, add the modules to reference, separated by semicolons. Here's an example of the format to use for **Additional Module Dependencies**: `ModuleName1=Path\To\ModuleName1.ifc; ModuleName2=Path\To\ModuleName2.ifc`
:::image type="content" source="media/vs2019-additional-module-dependencies.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing project Property Pages properties under Configuration Properties, C/C++, General, with Additional Module Dependencies selected.":::

### Select among multiple copies of a header unit

If you reference projects that build multiple header units, either with the same name or for the same header file, you must specify which one to use. You might have different versions of the header unit built with different compiler settings, for example, and must specify the one that matches your project settings.

Use the project's **Additional Header Unit Dependencies** property to resolve collisions by specifying which header unit to use. Otherwise, it isn't possible to predict which one is picked.

To set the **Additional Header Unit Dependencies** property:

1. On the main menu, select **Project** > **Properties** to open the project Property Pages dialog.
1. In the left pane of the dialog, select **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **General**.
1. Specify which modules or header unit files to use in **Additional Header Unit Dependencies** to resolve collisions. Use this format for **Additional Header Unit Dependencies**: `Path\To\Header1.h= Path\To\HeaderUnit1.ifc;Path\To\Header2.h= Path\To\ HeaderUnit2.ifc`
:::image type="content" source="media/additional-header-unit-dependencies-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Additional Header Unit Dependencies setting in the project Property Pages dialog.":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that projects that share header units are built with compatible compilation options. If you use compilation options when you implement the header unit that are different from the ones you used when you created it, the compiler will issue warnings.

> [!NOTE]
> To use header units built as a part of a DLL project, set **All Modules are Public** to **Yes**.

## <a name="approach2"></a>Approach 2: Scan includes for STL headers to import

Another way to import STL libraries is to have Visual Studio scan for the STL headers you `#include` in your project and compile them into header units. The compiler then imports rather than includes those headers.

This option is convenient when your project includes many STL header files across many files, or when build throughput isn't critical. This option doesn't guarantee that a header unit for a particular header file is built only once. However, it's useful if you have a large codebase: You don't have to change your source code to take advantage of the benefits of header units for many of the STL libraries you use.

This approach is less flexible than the static library approach, because it doesn't lend itself towards reusing the built header units in other projects. This approach might not be appropriate for larger projects: It doesn't guarantee an optimal build time, since all of the sources must be scanned for `#include` statements.

Not all header files can be automatically converted to header units. For example, headers that depend on conditional compilation via macros shouldn't be converted to header units. There's an allowlist in the form of a `header-units.json` file for the STL headers that the compiler uses when `/translateInclude` is specified. It determines which STL headers can be compiled into header units. The `header-units.json` file is under the installation directory for Visual Studio. For example, `%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.30.30705\include\header-units.json`. If the STL header file isn't on the list, it's treated as a normal `#include` instead of importing it as a header unit. Another advantage of the `header-units.json` file is that it prevents symbol duplication in the built header units. That is, if compiling a header unit brings in another library header multiple times, the symbols won't be duplicated.

To try out this approach, create a project that includes two STL libraries. Then, change the project's properties so that it imports the libraries as header units instead of including them, as described in the next section.

### Create a C++ console app project

Follow these steps to create a project that includes two STL libraries: `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.

1. In Visual Studio, create a new C++ console app project.
1. Replace the contents of the source file as follows:

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>
    
    int main()
    {
        std::vector<int> numbers = {0, 1, 2};
        std::cout << numbers[1];
    }
    ```

### Set project options and run the project

The following steps set the option that causes the compiler to scan for included headers to translate into header units. They also set the option that causes the compiler to treat `#include` as if you had written `import` for header files that can be treated as header units.

1. On the main menu, select **Project** > **Properties** to open the project Property Pages dialog.
1. Select **All Configurations** in the **Configuration** dropdown list, and then select **All Platforms** in the **Platform** dropdown list. These settings ensure that your changes apply whether you're building for debug or release, and other configurations.
1. In the left pane of the dialog, select **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **General**.
1. Set **Scan Sources for Module Dependencies** to **Yes**. This setting ensures that all compatible header files compile into header units.
1. Set **Translate Includes to Imports** to **Yes**. This setting compiles the STL header files listed in the `header-unit.json` file as header units, and then imports them instead of using the preprocessor to `#include` them.
:::image type="content" source="media/vs2019-scan-module-dependencies.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the scan module dependencies property setting in the project Property Pages.":::
1. Choose **OK** to save your changes and close the project Property Pages dialog.

The [`/std:c++20`](./reference/std-specify-language-standard-version.md) option or later is required to use header units. To change the C++ language standard used by the compiler:

1. On the main menu, select **Project** > **Properties** to open the project Property Pages dialog.
1. Select **All Configurations** in the **Configuration** dropdown list, and then select **All Platforms** in the **Platform** dropdown list. These settings ensure that your changes apply whether you're building for debug or release, and other configurations.
1. In the left pane of the project Property Pages dialog, select **Configuration Properties** > **General**.
1. In the **C++ Language Standard** dropdown list, select **ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++20)** (or later).
1. Choose **OK** to save your changes and close the project Property Pages dialog.
1. From the main menu, build the solution by selecting **Build** > **Build Solution**.

Run the solution to verify that it produces the expected output: `1`

The main consideration for whether to use this approach is the balance between convenience and the cost of scanning all your files to determine which header files to build as header units.
