# Special NMAKE Macros

NMAKE provides several special macros to represent various filenames and commands. One use for some of these macros is in the predefined inference rules. Like all macros, the macros provided by NMAKE are case sensitive.

- [Filename macros](../build/filename-macros.md)

- [Recursion macros](../build/recursion-macros.md)

- [Command macros and options macros](../build/command-macros-and-options-macros.md)

- [Environment-Variable Macros](../build/environment-variable-macros.md)
