# How to: Build Registration-Free COM Components
Registration-free COM components are COM components that have manifests built into the DLLs.  
  
### To build manifests into COM components  
  
1.  Open the project property pages for the COM component.  
  
2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node, and then expand the **Manifest Tool** node.  
  
3.  Select the **Input and Output** property page, and then set the **Embed Manifest** property equal to **Yes**.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
5.  Build the solution.
