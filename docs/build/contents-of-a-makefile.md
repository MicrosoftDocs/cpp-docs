# Contents of a Makefile
A makefile contains:  
  
-   [Description blocks](../build/description-blocks.md)  
  
-   [Commands](../build/commands-in-a-makefile.md)  
  
-   [Macros](../build/macros-and-nmake.md)  
  
-   [Inference rules](../build/inference-rules.md)  
  
-   [Dot directives](../build/dot-directives.md)  
  
-   [Preprocessing directives](../build/makefile-preprocessing.md)  
  
## Remarks  
 Other features you can use in a makefile are [wildcards](../build/wildcards-and-nmake.md), [long filenames](../build/long-filenames-in-a-makefile.md), [comments](../build/comments-in-a-makefile.md), and [special characters](../build/special-characters-in-a-makefile.md).  
  
 For a sample, see [Sample Makefile](../build/sample-makefile.md).
