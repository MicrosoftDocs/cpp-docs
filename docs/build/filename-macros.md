# Filename Macros
Filename macros are predefined as filenames specified in the dependency (not full filename specifications on disk). These macros do not need to be enclosed in parentheses when invoked; specify only a $ as shown.  
  
|Macro|Meaning|  
|-----------|-------------|  
|**$@**|Current target's full name (path, base name, extension), as currently specified.|  
|**$$@**|Current target's full name (path, base name, extension), as currently specified. Valid only as a dependent in a dependency.|  
|**$&#42;**|Current target's path and base name minus file extension.|  
|**$&#42;&#42;**|All dependents of the current target.|  
|**$?**|All dependents with a later timestamp than the current target.|  
|**$<**|Dependent file with a later timestamp than the current target. Valid only in commands in inference rules.|  
  
 To specify part of a predefined filename macro, append a macro modifier and enclose the modified macro in parentheses.  
  
|Modifier|Resulting filename part|  
|--------------|-----------------------------|  
|**D**|Drive plus directory|  
|**B**|Base name|  
|**F**|Base name plus extension|  
|**R**|Drive plus directory plus base name|
