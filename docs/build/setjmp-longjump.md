# setjmp/longjump
When you include setjmpex.h or setjmp.h, all calls to [setjmp](../c-runtime-library/reference/setjmp.md) or [longjmp](../c-runtime-library/reference/longjmp.md) will result in an unwind that invokes destructors and finally calls.  This differs from x86, where including setjmp.h results in finally clauses and destructors not being invoked.  
  
 A call to `setjmp` preserves the current stack pointer, non-volatile registers, and MxCsr registers.  Calls to `longjmp` return to the most recent `setjmp` call site and resets the stack pointer, non-volatile registers, and MxCsr registers, back to the state as preserved by the most recent `setjmp` call.
