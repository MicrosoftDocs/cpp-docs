# Creating Desktop Projects By Using Application Wizards

Every type of Visual C++ project has an application wizard that helps you generate new projects quickly and easily, modeled from the project template.  To open an application wizard, use the **New Project** dialog box to specify project properties such as the name of the project, or the directory and solution where your project will reside.

#### To open a Visual C++ application wizard

1. On the **File** menu, click **New**, and then click **Project**.

   The **New Project** dialog box appears.

1. In the Project Types pane, select the **Visual C++ Projects** folder. An icon for every type of C++ project appears in the Templates pane.

1. In the Templates pane, select an icon to choose a project type. A message appears under both panes indicating the type of project you are going to create.

1. Specify your project properties, or skip this step to use Visual Studio default project properties. See [Working with Project Properties](working-with-project-properties.md) for details.

1. Click **OK**, and the wizard for your project type opens. If you want to read the help topic for the wizard, press **F1**.

When you create a project you can either create a new solution or you can add the project to an existing solution. For more information, see [How to: Create a C++ Project from Existing Code](how-to-create-a-cpp-project-from-existing-code.md).
