# Non-MFC DLLs: Overview

A non-MFC DLL is a DLL that does not use MFC internally, and the exported functions in the DLL can be called by either MFC or non-MFC executable files. Functions are usually exported from a non-MFC DLL using the standard C interface.

For more information about non-MFC DLLs, see [Dynamic-Link Libraries](/windows/desktop/dlls/dynamic-link-libraries) in the Windows SDK.
