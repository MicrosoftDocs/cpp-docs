# Common Visual C++ 64-bit Migration Issues

When you use Visual C++ to create applications to run on a 64-bit Windows operating system, you should be aware of the following issues:  
  
-   An `int` and a `long` are 32-bit values on 64-bit Windows operating systems. For programs that you plan to compile for 64-bit platforms, you should be careful not to assign pointers to 32-bit variables. Pointers are 64-bit on 64-bit platforms, and you will truncate the pointer value if you assign it to a 32-bit variable.  
  
-   `size_t`, `time_t`, and `ptrdiff_t` are 64-bit values on 64-bit Windows operating systems.  
  
-   `time_t` is a 32-bit value on 32-bit Windows operating systems in Visual C++ versions before Visual C++ 2005. `time_t` is now a 64-bit integer by default. For more information, see [Time Management](../c-runtime-library/time-management.md).  
  
     You should be aware of where your code takes an `int` value and processes it as a `size_t` or `time_t` value. It is possible that the number could grow to be larger than a 32-bit number and data will be truncated when it is passed back to the `int` storage.  
  
The %x (hex `int` format) `printf` modifier will not work as expected on a 64-bit Windows operating system. It will only operate on the first 32 bits of the value that is passed to it.  
  
-   Use %I32x to display a 32-bit integral type in hex format.  
  
-   Use %I64x to display a 64-bit integral type in hex format.  
  
-   The %p (hex format for a pointer) will work as expected on a 64-bit Windows operating system.
