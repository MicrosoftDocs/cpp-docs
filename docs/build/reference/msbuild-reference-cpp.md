# MSBuild reference for C++ projects

MSBuild is the native build system for all projects in Visual Studio, including C++ projects. When you build a project in the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE), it invokes the msbuild.exe tool, which in turn consumes the .vcxproj project file, and various .targets and .props files. In general, we strongly recommend using the Visual Studio IDE to set project properties and invoke MSBuild. Manually editing project files can lead to serious problems if not done correctly.

If for some reason you wish to use MSBuild directly from the command line, see [Use MSBuild from the command line](../msbuild-visual-cpp.md). For more information about MSBuild in general, see [MSBuild](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild) in the Visual Studio documentation.
