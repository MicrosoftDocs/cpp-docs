# `/Fo` (Object File Name)

Specifies an object (*`.obj`*) file name or directory to be used instead of the default.

## Syntax

> **`/Fo"pathname"`**\
> **`/Fo:[ ]"pathname"`**

## Remarks

You can use the **`/Fo`** compiler option to set an output directory for all the object files generated by the CL compiler command. Or, you can use it to rename a single object file. Don't put a space between the **`/Fo`** option and the *`pathname`* argument.

By default, the object files generated by the compiler are placed in the current directory. They're given the base name of the source file and a *`.obj`* extension.

To use the **`/Fo`** option to rename an object file, specify the output filename as the *`pathname`* argument. When you rename an object file, you can use any name and extension you want, but the recommended convention is to use an *`.obj`* extension. The compiler generates command line error D8036 if you specify a filename to **`/Fo`** when you've specified more than one source file to compile.

To use the **`/Fo`** option to set an output directory for all object files created by the CL command, specify the directory as the *`pathname`* argument. A directory is indicated by a trailing slash or backslash in the *`pathname`* argument. Use an escaped backslash (a double backslash), if you're using a quoted path. The directory path can be absolute, or relative to the source directory. The specified directory must exist, or the compiler reports error D8003. The directory isn't created automatically.

## Example

This command line demonstrates the format that allows for an optional space between the `/Fo` option and the *`pathname`* argument. It creates an object file named *`test.obj`* in the current directory.

```cmd
CL /Fo: "test" /EHsc /c sample1.cpp
```

The following command line creates object files named *`sample1.obj`* and *`sample2.obj`* in an existing directory, *`D:\intermediate\`*. It uses escaped backslash characters as path segment separators in a quoted path:

```cmd
CL /Fo"D:\\intermediate\\" /EHsc /c sample1.cpp sample2.cpp
```

This command line creates object files named *`sample1.obj`* and *`sample2.obj`* in an existing directory, *`output\`*, relative to the source directory.

```cmd
CL /Fooutput\ /EHsc /c sample1.cpp sample2.cpp
```

## Set the option in Visual Studio or programmatically

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Set C++ compiler and build properties in Visual Studio](../working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Output Files** property page.

1. Modify the **Object File Name** property to set the output directory. In the IDE, the object files must have an extension of *`.obj`*.

### To set this compiler option programmatically

- See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.ObjectFile%2A>.
