# /vd (Disable Construction Displacements)
## Syntax  
  
```  
/vdn  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `0`  
 Suppresses the vtordisp constructor/destructor displacement member. Choose this option only if you are certain that all class constructors and destructors call virtual functions virtually.  
  
 `1`  
 Enables the creation of hidden vtordisp constructor/destructor displacement members. This choice is the default.  
  
 `2`  
 Allows you to use [dynamic_cast Operator](../../cpp/dynamic-cast-operator.md) on an object being constructed. For example, a dynamic_cast from a virtual base class to a derived class.  
  
 **/vd2** adds a vtordisp field when you have a virtual base with virtual functions. **/vd1** should be sufficient. The most common case where **/vd2** is necessary is when the only virtual function in your virtual base is a destructor.  
  
## Remarks  
 These options apply only to C++ code that uses virtual bases.  
  
 Visual C++ implements C++ construction displacement support in situations where virtual inheritance is used. Construction displacements solve the problem created when a virtual function, declared in a virtual base and overridden in a derived class, is called from a constructor during construction of a further derived class.  
  
 The problem is that the virtual function may be passed an incorrect `this` pointer as a result of discrepancies between the displacements to the virtual bases of a class and the displacements to its derived classes. The solution provides a single construction displacement adjustment, called a vtordisp field, for each virtual base of a class.  
  
 By default, vtordisp fields are introduced whenever the code defines user-defined constructors and destructors and also overrides virtual functions of virtual bases.  
  
 These options affect entire source files. Use [vtordisp](../../preprocessor/vtordisp.md) to suppress and then re-enable vtordisp fields on a class-by-class basis.  
  
### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  
  
1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  
  
2.  Click the **C/C++** folder.  
  
3.  Click the **Command Line** property page.  
  
4.  Type the compiler option in the **Additional Options** box.  
  
### To set this compiler option programmatically  
  
-   See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.AdditionalOptions%2A>.
