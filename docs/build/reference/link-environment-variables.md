# LINK Environment Variables

The LINK tool uses the following environment variables:  
  
-   LINK and \_LINK\_, if defined. The LINK tool prepends the options and arguments defined in the LINK environment variable and appends the options and arguments defined in the \_LINK\_ environment variable to the command line arguments before processing.  
  
-   LIB, if defined. The LINK tools uses the LIB path when searching for an object, library, or other file specified on the command line or by the [/BASE](../../build/reference/base-base-address.md) option. It also uses the LIB path to find a .pdb file named in an object. The LIB variable can contain one or more path specifications, separated by semicolons. One path must point to the \lib subdirectory of your Visual C++ installation.  
  
-   PATH, if the tool needs to run CVTRES and cannot find the file in the same directory as LINK itself. (LINK requires CVTRES to link a .res file.) PATH must point to the \bin subdirectory of your Visual C++ installation.  
  
-   TMP, to specify a directory when linking OMF or .res files.
