# `/experimental:log` (Structured SARIF diagnostics)

Output [SARIF](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/) diagnostics to the specified file or directory. For more information, see [Structured SARIF Diagnostics](sarif-output.md).

## Syntax

> **`/experimental:log`** *filename*\
> **`/experimental:log`** *directoryname\\*

## Arguments

*filename*

The output file for SARIF diagnostics. The compiler automatically adds the `.sarif` extension to *filename*. The space between `/experimental:log` and *filename* is optional. Use double quotes around paths containing spaces. Both relative and absolute paths are supported.

*directoryname\\*

The output directory for SARIF diagnostics (for example, `/experimental:log sarif_output\`). Remember to add the trailing backslash (`\`) to indicate it's a directory. Each source file name forms the base name for each SARIF file saved in the directory. The compiler automatically adds the `.sarif` extension to each file name. The space between `/experimental:log` and *directoryname\\* is optional. Use double quotes around paths containing spaces. Both relative and absolute paths are supported.

## Remarks

This option is available starting in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.8.

Diagnostics are also output as text to the console as usual.

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Set C++ compiler and build properties in Visual Studio](../working-with-project-properties.md).
1. Select the specific project **Configuration** and **Platform** for which you want to change the property. You can also choose **"All Configurations"** and **"All Platforms"**.
1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Command Line** property page.
1. Modify the **Additional Options** property, and then choose **OK**.

## Examples

The following command produces SARIF information for the compilation of `main.cpp` and saves it in the file `mySarifInfo.sarif`:

```cmd
cl /experimental:log mySarifInfo main.cpp
```

The following command produces SARIF information for the entire compilation and saves it in the `sarif_output` directory in the files `main.sarif` and `other.sarif`:

```cmd
cl /experimental:log sarif_output\ main.cpp other.cpp
```
