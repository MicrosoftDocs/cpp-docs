# /DLL (Build a DLL)
```  
/DLL  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The /DLL option builds a DLL as the main output file. A DLL usually contains exports that can be used by another program. There are three methods for specifying exports, listed in recommended order of use:  
  
1.  [__declspec(dllexport)](../../cpp/dllexport-dllimport.md) in the source code  
  
2.  An [EXPORTS](../../build/reference/exports.md) statement in a .def file  
  
3.  An [/EXPORT](../../build/reference/export-exports-a-function.md) specification in a LINK command  
  
 A program can use more than one method.  
  
 Another way to build a DLL is with the **LIBRARY** module-definition statement. The /BASE and /DLL options together are equivalent to the **LIBRARY** statement.  
  
 Do not specify this option within the development environment; this option is for use only on the command line. This option is set when you create a DLL project with an Application Wizard.  
  
 Note that if you create your import library in a preliminary step, before creating your .dll, you must pass the same set of object files when building the .dll, as you passed when building the import library.  
  
### To set this linker option in the Visual Studio development environment  
  
1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Setting Visual C++ Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  
  
2.  Click the **Configuration Properties** folder.  
  
3.  Click the **General** property page.  
  
4.  Modify the **Configuration Type** property.  
  
### To set this linker option programmatically  
  
-   See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCPropertySheet.ConfigurationType%2A>.
