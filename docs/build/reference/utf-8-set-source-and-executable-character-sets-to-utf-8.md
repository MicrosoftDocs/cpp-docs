# /utf-8 (Set Source and Executable character sets to UTF-8)
Specifies both the source character set and the execution character set as UTF-8.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
/utf-8  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 You can use the **/utf-8** option to specify both the source and execution character sets as encoded by using UTF-8. It is equivalent to specifying **/source-charset:utf-8 /execution-charset:utf-8** on the command line. Any of these options also enables the **/validate-charset** option by default. For a list of supported code page identifiers and character set names, see [Code Page Identifiers](/windows/desktop/Intl/code-page-identifiers).  
  
 By default, Visual Studio detects a byte-order mark to determine if the source file is in an encoded Unicode format, for example, UTF-16 or UTF-8. If no byte-order mark is found, it assumes the source file is encoded using the current user code page, unless you have specified a code page by using **/utf-8** or the **/source-charset** option. Visual Studio allows you to save your C++ source code by using any of several character encodings. For information about source and execution character sets, see [Character Sets](../../cpp/character-sets.md) in the language documentation.  
  
### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  
  
1.  Open the project **Property Pages** dialog box. For more information, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  
  
2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties**, **C/C++**, **Command Line** folder.  
  
3.  In **Advanced Options**, add the **/utf-8** option, and specify your preferred encoding.  
  
4.  Choose **OK** to save your changes.
