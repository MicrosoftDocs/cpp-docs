# C/C++ Property Pages

The following property pages are found under **Project** > **Properties** > **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++**:

## C/C++ General Properties

### Additional Include Directories

Specifies one or more directories to add to the include path; separate with semi-colons if more than one. Sets [/I (Additional include directories)](i-additional-include-directories.md).

### Additional #using Directories

Specifies one or more directories (separate directory names with a semicolon) to be searched to resolve names passed to a #using directive. Sets [/AI](ai-specify-metadata-directories.md).

### Debug Information Format

Specifies the type of debugging information generated by the compiler.  This property requires compatible linker settings. Sets [/Z7, /Zi, /ZI (Debug Information Format)](z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md).

#### Choices

- **None** - Produces no debugging information, so compilation may be faster.
- **C7 compatible** - Select the type of debugging information created for your program and whether this information is kept in object (.obj) files or in a program database (PDB).
- **Program Database** - Produces a program database (PDB) that contains type information and symbolic debugging information for use with the debugger. The symbolic debugging information includes the names and types of variables and functions, and line numbers.
- **Program Database for Edit And Continue** - Produces a program database, as described above, in a format that supports the [Edit and Continue](/visualstudio/debugger/edit-and-continue) feature.

### Support Just My Code Debugging

Adds supporting code for enabling [Just My Code](/visualstudio/debugger/just-my-code) debugging in this compilation unit. Sets [/JMC](jmc.md).

### Common Language RunTime Support

Use the .NET runtime service.  This switch is incompatible with some other switches; see the documentation on the [/clr](clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md) family of switches for details.

#### Choices

- **No Common Language RunTime Support** - No Common Language RunTime Support
- **Common Language RunTime Support** - Creates metadata for your application that can be consumed by other CLR applications. Also allows your application to consume types and data in the metadata of other CLR components.
- **Pure MSIL Common Language RunTime Support** - Produces an [MSIL](/dotnet/standard/managed-code)-only output file with no native executable code, although it can contain native types compiled to MSIL.
- **Safe MSIL Common Language RunTime Support** - Produces an MSIL-only (no native executable code) and verifiable output file.

### Consume Windows Runtime Extension

Consume the Windows Run Time languages extensions. Sets [/ZW](zw-windows-runtime-compilation.md).

### Suppress Startup Banner

Suppresses the display of the sign-on banner when the compiler starts up and display of informational messages during compiling.

### Warning Level

Select how strict you want the compiler to be about code errors. Sets [/W0 - /W4](compiler-option-warning-level.md).

#### Choices

- **Turn Off All Warnings** - Level 0 disables all warnings.

- **Level3** - Level 3 displays all level 2 warnings and all other warnings recommended for production purposes.
- **Level4** - Level 4 displays all level 3 warnings plus informational warnings, which in most cases can be safely ignored.
- **EnableAllWarnings** - Enables all warnings, including the ones disabled by default.

### Treat Warnings As Errors

Treats compiler warnings as errors. For a new project, it may be best to use [/WX](wx-treat-linker-warnings-as-errors.md) in every compilation. Resolve all warnings to minimize hard-to-find code defects.

### Warning Version

- **Column Info** - Additionally provides the column number within the line where the diagnostic is issued, where applicable.
- **Classic** - Outputs only the prior, concise diagnostic messages with the line number.

### SDL checks

Additional Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) recommended checks; includes enabling additional secure code generation features and enables extra security-relevant warnings as errors. Sets [/sdl, /sdl-](sdl-enable-additional-security-checks.md).

### Multi-processor Compilation

Multi-processor Compilation.

#### Choices

- **Default**
- **Disabled** - Disables inline expansion, which is on by default.
- **Only __inline** - Expands only functions marked as **inline**, `__inline`, `__forceinline`, or `__inline`. Or, in a C++ member function, defined within a class declaration.
- **Any Suitable** - Expands functions marked as **inline** or `__inline` and any other function that the compiler chooses. (Expansion occurs at the compiler's discretion, often referred to as *auto-inlining*.)

### Enable Intrinsic Functions

Enables intrinsic functions.  Using intrinsic functions generates faster, but possibly larger, code. Sets [/Oi](oi-generate-intrinsic-functions.md).

### Favor Size Or Speed

Whether to favor code size or code speed; 'Global Optimization' must be turned on. Sets [/Ot, /Os](os-ot-favor-small-code-favor-fast-code.md).

#### Choices

- **Favor small code** - Favor Small Code. Minimizes the size of EXEs and DLLs by instructing the compiler to favor size over speed.
- **Favor fast code** - Favor Fast Code. Maximizes the speed of EXEs and DLLs by instructing the compiler to favor speed over size. (This value is the default.)
- **Neither** - No size and speed optimization.

### Omit Frame Pointers

Suppresses creation of frame pointers on the call stack.

### Enable Fiber-Safe Optimizations

Enables memory space optimization when using fibers and thread local storage access. Sets [/GT](gt-support-fiber-safe-thread-local-storage.md).

### Preprocess Suppress Line Numbers

Preprocess without #line directives.

### Keep Comments

Suppresses comment strip from source code; requires that one of the 'Preprocessing' options be set. Sets [/C](c-preserve-comments-during-preprocessing.md).

## C/C++ Code Generation Properties

### Enable String Pooling

The compiler creates only one read-only copy of identical strings in the program image. It results in smaller programs, an optimization called *string pooling*. [/O1, /O2](o-options-optimize-code.md), and [/ZI](z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md)  automatically set [/GF](gf-eliminate-duplicate-strings.md) option.

- **Multi-threaded Debug** - Defines _DEBUG and _MT. This option also causes the compiler to place the library name *LIBCMTD.lib* into the *`.obj`* file so that the linker will use *LIBCMTD.lib* to resolve external symbols.
- **Multi-threaded DLL** - Causes your application to use the multithread- and DLL-specific version of the run-time library. Defines _MT and _DLL and causes the compiler to place the library name *MSVCRT.lib* into the *`.obj`* file.
- **Multi-threaded Debug DLL** - Defines _DEBUG, _MT, and _DLL and causes your application to use the debug multithread- and DLL-specific version of the run-time library. It also causes the compiler to place the library name *MSVCRTD.lib* into the *`.obj`* file.

### Struct Member Alignment

### Enable Parallel Code Generation

Allows the compiler to generate parallel code for loops identified using `#pragma loop(hint_parallel[(n)])` when optimization is enabled.

### Enable Enhanced Instruction Set

Enable use of instructions found on processors that support enhanced instruction sets. For example, the SSE, SSE2, AVX, and AVX2 enhancements to IA-32. And, the AVX and AVX2 enhancements to x64. Currently **`/arch:SSE`** and **`/arch:SSE2`** are only available when building for the x86 architecture. If no option is specified, the compiler will use instructions found on processors that support SSE2. Use of enhanced instructions can be disabled with **`/arch:IA32`**.

Sets the floating point model. Sets [/fp:precise, /fp:strict, /fp:fast](fp-specify-floating-point-behavior.md).

#### Choices

- **Strict** - The strictest floating-point model. **`/fp:strict`** causes **`fp_contract`** to be OFF and **`fenv_access`** to be ON. **`/fp:except`** is implied and can be disabled by explicitly specifying **`/fp:except-`**. When used with **`/fp:except-`**, **`/fp:strict`** enforces strict floating-point semantics but without respect for exceptional events.
- **Fast** - Creates the fastest code in the majority of cases.

### Enable Floating Point Exceptions

Reliable floating-point exception model. Exceptions will be raised immediately after they're triggered. Sets [/fp:except](fp-specify-floating-point-behavior.md).
