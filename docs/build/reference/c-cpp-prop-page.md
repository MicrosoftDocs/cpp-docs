# C/C++ Property Pages

The following property pages are found under **Project** > **Properties** > **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++**:

## C/C++ General Properties

### Additional Include Directories

Specifies one or more directories to add to the include path. Separate directories with semi-colons ('`;`') if there's more than one. Sets the [`/I` (Additional include directories)](i-additional-include-directories.md) compiler option.

### Additional #using Directories

Specifies one or more directories to search to resolve names passed to a `#using` directive. Separate directories with semi-colons ('`;`') if there's more than one. Sets the [`/AI`](ai-specify-metadata-directories.md) compiler option.

### Additional BMI Directories

Specifies one or more directories to search to resolve names passed to an `import` directive. Separate directories with semi-colons ('`;`') if there's more than one. Sets the **`/ifcSearchDir[path]`** compiler option.

### Additional Module Dependencies

Specifies one or more modules to use to resolve names passed to an `import` directive. Separate directories with semi-colons ('`;`') if there's more than one. Sets the [`/reference`](module-reference.md) compiler option.

### Additional Header Unit Dependencies

Specifies one or more header units to use to resolve names passed to an `import` header directive. Separate directories with semi-colons ('`;`') if there's more than one. Sets the [`/headerUnit`](headerunit.md) compiler option.

### Scan Sources for Module Dependencies

When set to **Yes**, the compiler scans all C++ sources, not just module interface and header unit sources, for module and header units dependencies. The build system builds the full dependencies graph, which ensures that all imported modules and header units are built before compiling the files that depend on them. When combined with **Translate Includes to Imports**, any header file that's specified in a [`header-units.json`](header-unit-json-reference.md) file in the same directory as the header file is compiled into a header unit.

Files that have the extension *`.ixx`*, and files that have their **File properties** > **C/C++** > **Compile As** property set to **Compile as C++ Header Unit (/exportHeader)**, are always scanned.

### Translate Includes to Imports

When set to **Yes**, the compiler treats a `#include` directive as an `import` directive if certain conditions are met: The header file is specified in a *`header-units.json`* file in the same directory, and a compiled header unit (an *`.ifc`* file) is available for the header file. Otherwise, the header file is treated as a normal `#include`. The *`header-units.json`* file is used to build header units for each `#include` without symbol duplication. When combined with **Scan Sources for Module Dependencies**, the compiler automatically finds all of the header files that can be compiled into header units. This property sets the [`/translateInclude`](translateinclude.md) compiler option.

### Debug Information Format

Specifies the type of debugging information generated by the compiler.  This property requires compatible linker settings. Sets [`/Z7`, `/Zi`, `/ZI` (Debug information format)](z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md) compiler options.

#### Choices

- **None** - Produces no debugging information, so compilation may be faster.
- **C7 compatible** - Select the type of debugging information created for your program and whether this information is kept in object (.obj) files or in a program database (PDB).
- **Program Database** - Produces a program database (PDB) that contains type information and symbolic debugging information for use with the debugger. The symbolic debugging information includes the names and types of variables and functions, and line numbers.
- **Program Database for Edit And Continue** - Produces a program database, as described previously, in a format that supports the [Edit and Continue](/visualstudio/debugger/edit-and-continue) feature.

### Support Just My Code Debugging

Adds supporting code for enabling [Just My Code](/visualstudio/debugger/just-my-code) debugging in this compilation unit. Sets [`/JMC`](jmc.md).

- **Common Language RunTime Support** - Creates metadata for your application that can be consumed by other CLR applications. Also allows your application to consume types and data in the metadata of other CLR components.
- **Pure MSIL Common Language RunTime Support** - Produces an [MSIL](/dotnet/standard/managed-code)-only output file with no native executable code, although it can contain native types compiled to MSIL.
- **Safe MSIL Common Language RunTime Support** - Produces an MSIL-only (no native executable code) and verifiable output file.

### Consume Windows Runtime Extension

Consume the Windows Run Time languages extensions. Sets [`/ZW`](zw-windows-runtime-compilation.md).

### Suppress Startup Banner

Suppresses the display of the sign-on banner when the compiler starts up and display of informational messages during compiling.

### Warning Level

Select how strict you want the compiler to be about code errors. Sets [`/W0` - `/W4`](compiler-option-warning-level.md).

#### Choices

- **Turn Off All Warnings** - Level 0 disables all warnings.
- **Level1** - Level 1 displays severe warnings. Level 1 is the default warning level at the command line.
- **Level2** - Level 2 displays all level 1 warnings and warnings less severe than level 1.
- **Level3** - Level 3 displays all level 2 warnings and all other warnings recommended for production purposes.
- **Level4** - Level 4 displays all level 3 warnings plus informational warnings, which in most cases can be safely ignored.
- **EnableAllWarnings** - Enables all warnings, including the ones disabled by default.

### Treat Warnings As Errors

Treats compiler warnings as errors. For a new project, it may be best to use [`/WX`](wx-treat-linker-warnings-as-errors.md) in every compilation. Resolve all warnings to minimize hard-to-find code defects.

### Warning Version

Hide warnings introduced after a specific version of the compiler. Sets [`/Wv:xx[.yy[.zzzzz]]`](wx-treat-linker-warnings-as-errors.md).

### Diagnostics Format

### Preprocess Suppress Line Numbers

Preprocess without #line directives.

### Keep Comments

Suppresses comment strip from source code; requires setting at least one of the **Preprocessing** options. Sets [`/C`](c-preserve-comments-during-preprocessing.md).

## C/C++ Code Generation Properties

### Enable String Pooling

The compiler creates only one read-only copy of identical strings in the program image. It results in smaller programs, an optimization called *string pooling*. [`/O1`, `/O2`](o-options-optimize-code.md), and [`/ZI`](z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md) automatically set [`/GF`](gf-eliminate-duplicate-strings.md) option.

#### Choices

- **Multi-threaded** - Causes your application to use the multithread, static version of the run-time library.
- **Multi-threaded Debug** - Defines `_DEBUG` and `_MT`. This option also causes the compiler to place the library name *`LIBCMTD.lib`* into the *`.obj`* file so that the linker will use *`LIBCMTD.lib`* to resolve external symbols.
- **Multi-threaded DLL** - Causes your application to use the multithread- and DLL-specific version of the run-time library. Defines `_MT` and `_DLL` and causes the compiler to place the library name *MSVCRT.lib* into the *`.obj`* file.
- **Multi-threaded Debug DLL** - Defines `_DEBUG`, `_MT`, and `_DLL` and causes your application to use the debug multithread- and DLL-specific version of the run-time library. It also causes the compiler to place the library name *`MSVCRTD.lib`* into the *`.obj`* file.

### Struct Member Alignment

Specifies 1, 2, 4, or 8-byte boundaries for struct member alignment. Sets [`/Zp`](zp-struct-member-alignment.md).

### Enable Enhanced Instruction Set

Enable use of instructions found on processors that support enhanced instruction sets. For example, the SSE, SSE2, AVX, and AVX2 enhancements to IA-32. And, the AVX and AVX2 enhancements to x64. Currently **`/arch:SSE`** and **`/arch:SSE2`** are only available when building for the x86 architecture. If no option is specified, the compiler uses instructions found on processors that support SSE2. Use of enhanced instructions can be disabled with **`/arch:IA32`**. For more information, see [`/arch (x86)`](arch-x86.md), [`/arch (x64)`](arch-x64.md), [`/arch (ARM64)`](arch-arm64.md), and [`/arch (ARM)`](arch-arm.md).

#### Choices

- **Precise** - Default. Improves the consistency of floating-point tests for equality and inequality.
- **Strict** - The strictest floating-point model. **`/fp:strict`** causes **`fp_contract`** to be OFF and **`fenv_access`** to be ON. **`/fp:except`** is implied and can be disabled by explicitly specifying **`/fp:except-`**. When used with **`/fp:except-`**, **`/fp:strict`** enforces strict floating-point semantics but without respect for exceptional events.
- **Fast** - Creates the fastest code in most cases.

### Enable Floating Point Exceptions

Reliable floating-point exception model. Exceptions will be raised immediately after they're triggered. Sets [`/fp:except`](fp-specify-floating-point-behavior.md).
