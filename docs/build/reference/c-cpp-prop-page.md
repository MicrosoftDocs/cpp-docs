# C/C++ Property Pages

The following property pages are found under **Project** > **Properties** > **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++**:

## C/C++ General Properties

### Additional Include Directories

Specifies one or more directories to add to the include path. Separate directories with semi-colons ('`;`') if there's more than one. Sets the [`/I` (Additional include directories)](i-additional-include-directories.md) compiler option.

### Additional #using Directories

Specifies one or more directories to search to resolve names passed to a `#using` directive. Separate directories with semi-colons ('`;`') if there's more than one. Sets the [`/AI`](ai-specify-metadata-directories.md) compiler option.

### Additional BMI Directories

Specifies one or more directories to search to resolve names passed to an `import` directive. Separate directories with semi-colons ('`;`') if there's more than one. Sets the **`/ifcSearchDir[path]`** compiler option.

### Additional Module Dependencies

Specifies one or more modules to use to resolve names passed to an `import` directive. Separate directories with semi-colons ('`;`') if there's more than one. Sets the [`/reference`](module-reference.md) compiler option.

### Additional Header Unit Dependencies

Specifies one or more header units to use to resolve names passed to an `import` header directive. Separate directories with semi-colons ('`;`') if there's more than one. Sets the [`/headerUnit`](headerunit.md) compiler option.

### Scan Sources for Module Dependencies

When set to **Yes**, the compiler scans all C++ sources, not just module interface and header unit sources, for module and header units dependencies. The build system builds the full dependencies graph, which ensures that all imported modules and header units are built before compiling the files that depend on them. When combined with **Translate Includes to Imports**, any header file that's specified in a [`header-units.json`](header-unit-json-reference.md) file in the same directory as the header file is compiled into a header unit.

Files that have the extension *`.ixx`*, and files that have their **File properties** > **C/C++** > **Compile As** property set to **Compile as C++ Header Unit (/exportHeader)**, are always scanned.

### Translate Includes to Imports

When set to **Yes**, the compiler treats a `#include` directive as an `import` directive if certain conditions are met: The header file is specified in a *`header-units.json`* file in the same directory, and a compiled header unit (an *`.ifc`* file) is available for the header file. Otherwise, the header file is treated as a normal `#include`. The *`header-units.json`* file is used to build header units for each `#include` without symbol duplication. When combined with **Scan Sources for Module Dependencies**, the compiler automatically finds all of the header files that can be compiled into header units. This property sets the [`/translateInclude`](translateinclude.md) compiler option.

### Debug Information Format

Specifies the type of debugging information generated by the compiler.  This property requires compatible linker settings. Sets [`/Z7`, `/Zi`, `/ZI` (Debug information format)](z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md) compiler options.

#### Choices

- **None** - Produces no debugging information, so compilation may be faster.
- **C7 compatible** - Select the type of debugging information created for your program and whether this information is kept in object (.obj) files or in a program database (PDB).
- **Program Database** - Produces a program database (PDB) that contains type information and symbolic debugging information for use with the debugger. The symbolic debugging information includes the names and types of variables and functions, and line numbers.
- **Program Database for Edit And Continue** - Produces a program database, as described previously, in a format that supports the [Edit and Continue](/visualstudio/debugger/edit-and-continue) feature.

### Support Just My Code Debugging

Adds supporting code for enabling [Just My Code](/visualstudio/debugger/just-my-code) debugging in this compilation unit. Sets [`/JMC`](jmc.md).

### Support C++ Dynamic Debugging

(Preview) Sets compiler flag [`/dynamicdeopt`](dynamic-deopt.md) to turn on [C++ Dynamic Debugging](/visualstudio/debugger/cpp-dynamic-debugging). Place deoptimized breakpoints and step in anywhere with on-demand function deoptimization. Use this mode for debugging optimized code.

- **Level2** - Level 2 displays all level 1 warnings and warnings less severe than level 1.
- **Level3** - Level 3 displays all level 2 warnings and all other warnings recommended for production purposes.
- **Level4** - Level 4 displays all level 3 warnings plus informational warnings, which in most cases can be safely ignored.
- **EnableAllWarnings** - Enables all warnings, including the ones disabled by default.

### Treat Warnings As Errors

Treats compiler warnings as errors. For a new project, it may be best to use [`/WX`](wx-treat-linker-warnings-as-errors.md) in every compilation. Resolve all warnings to minimize hard-to-find code defects.

### Warning Version

Hide warnings introduced after a specific version of the compiler. Sets [`/Wv:xx[.yy[.zzzzz]]`](wx-treat-linker-warnings-as-errors.md).
