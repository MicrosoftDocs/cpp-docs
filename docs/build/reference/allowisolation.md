# /ALLOWISOLATION
Specifies behavior for manifest lookup.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
/ALLOWISOLATION[:NO]  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 **/ALLOWISOLATION** causes the operating system to do manifest lookups and loads.  
  
 **/ALLOWISOLATION** is the default.  
  
 **/ALLOWISOLATION:NO** indicates that executables are loaded as if there were no manifest, and causes [EDITBIN Reference](../../build/reference/editbin-reference.md) to set the `IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_NO_ISOLATION` bit in the optional header's `DllCharacteristics` field.  
  
 When isolation is disabled for an executable, the Windows loader doesn't try to find an application manifest for the newly created process. The new process doesn't have a default activation context, even if there is a manifest in the executable itself or if there is a manifest that has the name *executable-name*.exe.manifest.
