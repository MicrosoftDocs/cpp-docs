# LIB Reference
The Microsoft Library Manager (LIB.exe) creates and manages a library of Common Object File Format (COFF) object files. LIB can also be used to create export files and import libraries to reference exported definitions.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can start this tool only from the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../assembler/masm/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] command prompt. You cannot start it from a system command prompt or from File Explorer.
