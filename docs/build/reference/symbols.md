# /SYMBOLS

```  
/SYMBOLS
```  

This option displays the COFF symbol table. Symbol tables exist in all object files. A COFF symbol table appears in an image file only if it is linked with /DEBUG.

The following is a description of the output for /SYMBOLS. Additional information on the meaning of /SYMBOLS output can be found by looking in winnt.h (IMAGE_SYMBOL and IMAGE_AUX_SYMBOL), or COFF documentation.

Given the following sample dump:

```  
Dump of file main.obj
File Type: COFF OBJECT

COFF SYMBOL TABLE
000 00000000 DEBUG    notype       Filename     | .file

008 00000000 UNDEF    notype ()    External     | ?MyDump@@YAXXZ (void __cdecl MyDump(void))  

String Table Size = 0x10 bytes

  Summary

         26 .drectve
         23 .text
```  

## Remarks

The following description, for lines that begin with a symbol number, describes columns that have information relevant to users:

- The first three-digit number is the symbol index/number.

- If the third column contains SECT*x*, the symbol is defined in that section of the object file. But if UNDEF appears, it is not defined in that object and must be resolved elsewhere.

- The fifth column (Static, External) tells whether the symbol is visible only within that object, or whether it is public (visible externally). A Static symbol, _sym, wouldn't be linked to a Public symbol _sym; these would be two different instances of functions named _sym.

The last column in a numbered line is the symbol name, both decorated and undecorated.

Only the [/HEADERS](../../build/reference/headers.md) DUMPBIN option is available for use on files produced with the [/GL](../../build/reference/gl-whole-program-optimization.md) compiler option.
