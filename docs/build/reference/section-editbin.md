# /SECTION (EDITBIN)
```  
/SECTION:name[=newname][,attributes][alignment]  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This option changes the attributes of a section, overriding the attributes that were set when the object file for the section was compiled or linked.  
  
 After the colon ( **:** ), specify the *name* of the section. To change the section name, follow *name* with an equal sign (=) and a *newname* for the section.  
  
 To set or change the section's `attributes`, specify a comma (**,**) followed by one or more attributes characters. To negate an attribute, precede its character with an exclamation point (!). The following characters specify memory attributes:  
  
|Attribute|Setting|  
|---------------|-------------|  
|c|code|  
|d|discardable|  
|e|executable|  
|i|initialized data|  
|k|cached virtual memory|  
|m|link remove|  
|o|link info|  
|p|paged virtual memory|  
|r|read|  
|s|shared|  
|u|uninitialized data|  
|w|write|  
  
 To control *alignment*, specify the character **A** followed by one of the following characters to set the size of alignment in bytes, as follows:  
  
|Character|Alignment size in bytes|  
|---------------|-----------------------------|  
|1|1|  
|2|2|  
|4|4|  
|8|8|  
|p|16|  
|t|32|  
|s|64|  
|x|no alignment|  
  
 Specify the `attributes` and *alignment* characters as a string with no white space. The characters are not case sensitive.
