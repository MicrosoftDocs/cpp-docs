# /RTC (Run-Time Error Checks)
Used to enable and disable the run-time error checks feature, in conjunction with the [runtime_checks](../../preprocessor/runtime-checks.md) pragma.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
/RTC1  
/RTCc  
/RTCs  
/RTCu  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `1`  
 Equivalent of **/RTC**`su`.  
  
 `c`  
 Reports when a value is assigned to a smaller data type and results in a data loss. For example, if a value of type `short 0x101` is assigned to a variable of type `char`.  
  
 This option reports situations in which you intend to truncate, for example, if you want the first eight bits of an `int` returned as a `char`. Because **/RTC**`c` causes a run-time error if any information is lost as a result of the assignment, you can mask off the information you need to avoid a run-time error as a result of **/RTC**`c`. For example:  
  
```  
#include <crtdbg.h>  
  
char get8bits(int value, int position) {  
   _ASSERT(position < 32);  
   return (char)(value >> position);  
   // Try the following line instead:  
   // return (char)((value >> position) & 0xff);  
}  
  
int main() {  
   get8bits(12341235,3);  
}  
```  
  
 `s`  
 Enables stack frame run-time error checking, as follows:  
  
-   Initialization of local variables to a nonzero value. This helps identify bugs that do not appear when running in debug mode. There is a greater chance that stack variables will still be zero in a debug build compared to a release build because of compiler optimizations of stack variables in a release build. Once a program has used an area of its stack, it is never reset to 0 by the compiler. Therefore, subsequent, uninitialized stack variables that happen to use the same stack area can return values left over from the prior use of this stack memory.  
  
-   Detection of overruns and underruns of local variables such as arrays. **/RTC**`s` will not detect overruns when accessing memory that results from compiler padding within a structure. Padding could occur by using [align](../../cpp/align-cpp.md), [/Zp (Struct Member Alignment)](../../build/reference/zp-struct-member-alignment.md), or [pack](../../preprocessor/pack.md), or if you order structure elements in such a way as to require the compiler to add padding.  
  
-   Stack pointer verification, which detects stack pointer corruption. Stack pointer corruption can be caused by a calling convention mismatch. For example, using a function pointer, you call a function in a DLL that is exported as [__stdcall](../../cpp/stdcall.md) but you declare the pointer to the function as [__cdecl](../../cpp/cdecl.md).  
  
 `u`  
 Reports when a variable is used without having been initialized. For example, an instruction that generates `C4701` may also generate a run-time error under **/RTC**`u`. Any instruction that generates [Compiler Warning (level 1 and level 4) C4700](../../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-1-and-level-4-c4700.md) will generate a run-time error under **/RTC**`u`.  
  
 However, consider the following code fragment:  
  
```cpp  
int a, *b, c;  
if ( 1 )  
b = &a;  
c = a;  // No run-time error with /RTCu  
```  
  
 If a variable could have been initialized, it will not be reported at run time by **/RTC**`u`. For example, after a variable is aliased through a pointer, the compiler will not track the variable and report uninitialized uses. In effect, you can initialize a variable by taking its address. The & operator works like an assignment operator in this situation.  
  
## Remarks  
 Run-time error checks are a way for you to find problems in your running code; for more information, see [How to: Use Native Run-Time Checks](/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-use-native-run-time-checks).  
  
 If you compile your program at the command line using any of the **/RTC** compiler options, any pragma [optimize](../../preprocessor/optimize.md) instructions in your code will silently fail. This is because run-time error checks are not valid in a release (optimized) build.  
  
 You should use **/RTC** for development builds; **/RTC** should not be used for a retail build. **/RTC** cannot be used with compiler optimizations ([/O Options (Optimize Code)](../../build/reference/o-options-optimize-code.md)). A program image built with **/RTC** will be slightly larger and slightly slower than an image built with **/Od** (up to 5 percent slower than an **/Od** build).  
  
 The __MSVC_RUNTIME_CHECKS preprocessor directive will be defined when you use any **/RTC** option or [/GZ](../../build/reference/gz-enable-stack-frame-run-time-error-checking.md).  
  
### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  
  
1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  
  
2.  Click the **C/C++** folder.  
  
3.  Click the **Code Generation** property page.  
  
4.  Modify one or both of the following properties: **Basic Runtime Checks** or **Smaller Type Check**.  
  
### To set this compiler option programmatically  
  
-   See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.BasicRuntimeChecks%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.SmallerTypeCheck%2A> properties.
