# .Res Files as Linker Input

You can specify a .res file when linking a program. The .res file is created by the resource compiler (RC). LINK automatically converts .res files to COFF. The CVTRES.exe tool must be in the same directory as LINK.exe or in a directory specified in the PATH environment variable.
