# /GT (Support Fiber-Safe Thread-Local Storage)
Supports fiber safety for data allocated using static thread-local storage, that is, data allocated with `__declspec(thread)`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
/GT  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Data declared with `__declspec(thread)` is referenced through a thread-local storage (TLS) array. The TLS array is an array of addresses that the system maintains for each thread. Each address in this array gives the location of thread-local storage data.  
  
 A fiber is a lightweight object that consists of a stack and a register context and can be scheduled on various threads. A fiber can run on any thread. Because a fiber may get swapped out and restarted later on a different thread, the address of the TLS array must not be cached or optimized as a common subexpression across a function call (see the [/Og (Global Optimizations)](../../build/reference/og-global-optimizations.md) option for details). **/GT** prevents such optimizations.  
  
### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  
  
1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  
  
2.  Click the **C/C++** folder.  
  
3.  Click the **Optimization** property page.  
  
4.  Modify the **Enable Fiber-safe Optimizations** property.  
  
### To set this compiler option programmatically  
  
-   See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.EnableFiberSafeOptimizations%2A>.
