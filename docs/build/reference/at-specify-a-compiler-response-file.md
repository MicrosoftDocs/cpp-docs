# @ (Specify a Compiler Response File)
Specifies a compiler response file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
@response_file  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `response_file`  
 A text file containing compiler commands.  
  
## Remarks  
 A response file can contain any commands that you would specify on the command line. This can be useful if your command-line arguments exceed 127 characters.  
  
 It is not possible to specify the **@** option from within a response file. That is, a response file cannot embed another response file.  
  
 From the command line you can specify as many response file options (for example, `@respfile.1 @respfile.2`) as you want.  
  
### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  
  
-   A response file cannot be specified from within the development environment and must be specified at the command line.  
  
### To set this compiler option programmatically  
  
-   This compiler option cannot be changed programmatically.
