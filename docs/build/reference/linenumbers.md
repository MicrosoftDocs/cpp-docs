# /LINENUMBERS

```
/LINENUMBERS
```

## Remarks

This option displays COFF line numbers. Line numbers exist in an object file if it was compiled with Program Database (/Zi), C7 Compatible (/Z7), or Line Numbers Only (/Zd). An executable file or DLL contains COFF line numbers if it was linked with Generate Debug Info (/DEBUG).

Only the [/HEADERS](../../build/reference/headers.md) DUMPBIN option is available for use on files produced with the [/GL](../../build/reference/gl-whole-program-optimization.md) compiler option.
