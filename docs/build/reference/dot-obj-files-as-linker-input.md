# .Obj Files as Linker Input

The linker tool (LINK.EXE) accepts .obj files that are in Common Object File Format (COFF).

## Remarks

Microsoft provides a complete description of the common object file format. For more information, see [PE Format](/windows/desktop/Debug/pe-format).

## Unicode support

Starting with Visual Studio 2005, the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler supports Unicode characters in identifiers as defined by the ISO/IEC C and C++ standards. Previous versions of the compiler supported only ASCII characters in identifiers. To support Unicode in the names of functions, classes, and statics, the compiler and linker use the Unicode UTF-8 encoding for COFF symbols in .obj files. The UTF-8 encoding is upwardly compatible with the ASCII encoding used by earlier versions of Visual Studio.

For more information about the compiler and linker, see [Unicode Support in the Compiler and Linker](../../build/reference/unicode-support-in-the-compiler-and-linker.md). For more information about the Unicode standard, see the [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/) organization.
