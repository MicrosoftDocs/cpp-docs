# Linker Support for Delay-Loaded DLLs
The Visual C++ linker now supports the delayed loading of DLLs. This relieves you of the need to use the Windows SDK functions **LoadLibrary** and **GetProcAddress** to implement DLL delayed loading.  
  
 Before Visual C++ 6.0, the only way to load a DLL at run time was by using **LoadLibrary** and **GetProcAddress**; the operating system would load the DLL when the executable or DLL using it was loaded.  
  
 Beginning with Visual C++ 6.0, when statically linking with a DLL, the linker provides options to delay load the DLL until the program calls a function in that DLL.  
  
 An application can delay load a DLL using the [/DELAYLOAD (Delay Load Import)](../../build/reference/delayload-delay-load-import.md) linker option with a helper function (default implementation provided by Visual C++). The helper function will load the DLL at run time by calling **LoadLibrary** and **GetProcAddress** for you.  
  
 You should consider delay loading a DLL if:  
  
-   Your program may not call a function in the DLL.  
  
-   A function in the DLL may not get called until late in your program's execution.  
  
 The delayed loading of a DLL can be specified during the build of either a .EXE or .DLL project. A .DLL project that delays the loading of one or more DLLs should not itself call a delay-loaded entry point in Dllmain.  
  
 The following topics describe delay loading DLLs:

-   [Explicitly Unloading a Delay-Loaded DLL](../../build/reference/explicitly-unloading-a-delay-loaded-dll.md)  
  
-   [Loading All Imports for a Delay-Loaded DLL](../../build/reference/loading-all-imports-for-a-delay-loaded-dll.md)  
  
-   [Binding Imports](../../build/reference/binding-imports.md)  
  
-   [Error Handling and Notification](../../build/reference/error-handling-and-notification.md)  
  
-   [Dumping Delay-Loaded Imports](../../build/reference/dumping-delay-loaded-imports.md)
