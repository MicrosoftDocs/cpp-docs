# EDITBIN Reference
The Microsoft COFF Binary File Editor (EDITBIN.EXE) modifies Common Object File Format (COFF) binary files. You can use EDITBIN to modify object files, executable files, and dynamic-link libraries (DLL).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can start this tool only from the Visual Studio command prompt. You cannot start it from a system command prompt or from File Explorer.  
  
 EDITBIN is not available for use on files produced with the [/GL](../../build/reference/gl-whole-program-optimization.md) compiler option. Any modifications to binary files produced with /GL will have to be achieved by recompiling and linking.

-   [EDITBIN options](../../build/reference/editbin-options.md)
