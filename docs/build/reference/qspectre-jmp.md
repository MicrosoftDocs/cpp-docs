# `/Qspectre-jmp`

Causes the compiler to generate an `int3` instruction (software interrupt) after unconditional direct branches. This option extends the [`/Qspectre`](qspectre.md) flag and mitigates speculative execution side-channel attacks on unconditional direct branches.

## Syntax

> **/Qspectre-jmp**

## Remarks

**`/Qspectre-jmp`** causes the compiler to detect executable instructions following unconditional direct branches. An `int3` is inserted following unconditional direct branches to ensure that no instructions are speculatively executed beyond the branch. For example, the compiler mitigates `jmp addr` by adding an `int3` instruction following the `jmp` instruction as shown here:

```asm
jmpâ€¯addr
int3
```

`/Qspectre-jmp` is off by default. It's supported for all optimization levels.
