# /SWAPRUN

```
/SWAPRUN:{[!]NET|[!]CD}
```

## Remarks

This option edits the image to tell the operating system to copy the image to a swap file and run it from there. Use this option for images that reside on networks or removable media.

You can add or remove the NET or CD qualifiers:

- NET indicates that the image resides on a network.

- CD indicates that the image resides on a CD-ROM or similar removable medium.

- Use !NET and !CD to reverse the effects of NET and CD.
