# `/fsanitize` (Enable sanitizers)

Use the **`/fsanitize`** compiler options to enable sanitizers.

## Syntax

> **`/fsanitize=address`**\
> **`/fsanitize=kernel-address`**\
> **`/fsanitize=fuzzer`**\
> **`/fsanitize-address-use-after-return`**\
> **`/fno-sanitize-address-vcasan-lib`**
> **`/fsanitize-address-asan-compat-lib`**
> **`/fno-sanitize-address-asan-compat-lib`**

## Remarks

The **`/fsanitize=address`** compiler option enables [AddressSanitizer](../../sanitizers/asan.md), a powerful compiler and runtime technology to uncover [hard-to-find bugs](../../sanitizers/asan.md#error-types). Support for the **`/fsanitize=address`** option is available starting in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9.

The **`/fsanitize=kernel-address`** compiler option enables [Kernel AddressSanitizer (KASan)](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/kasan). KASan is the kernel-mode variant of AddressSanitizer, available starting in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.11. KASan is only supported on Windows 11 24H2 or Windows Server 2025 and higher, and requires building using a Windows SDK 10.0.26100.2161 and higher. Building with KASan also implies the **`/fsanitize-address-asan-compat-lib`** compiler option.

The **`/fsanitize=fuzzer`** compiler option enables experimental support for [LibFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html). LibFuzzer is a coverage-guided fuzzing library that can be used to find bugs and crashes caused by user-provided input. We recommended you use **`/fsanitize=address`** with LibFuzzer. This option is useful for fuzzing tools such as OneFuzz. For more information, see the [OneFuzz documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/project-onefuzz/) and [OneFuzz GitHub project](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz). Support for the **`/fsanitize=fuzzer`** option is available starting in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0.

The **`/fsanitize`** option doesn't allow comma-separated syntax, for example: **`/fsanitize=address,fuzzer`**. These options must be specified individually.

The **`/fsanitize-address-use-after-return`**, **`/fno-sanitize-address-vcasan-lib`**, **`/fsanitize-address-asan-compat-lib`**, and **`/fno-sanitize-address-asan-compat-lib`** compiler options, and the [`/INFERASANLIBS` (Use inferred sanitizer libs)](./inferasanlibs.md) and **`/INFERASANLIBS:NO`** linker options offer support for advanced users. For more information, see [AddressSanitizer build and language reference](../../sanitizers/asan-building.md).

### To set the **`/fsanitize=address`** compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open your project's **Property Pages** dialog box.

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **General** property page.

1. Modify the **Enable Address Sanitizer** property. To enable it, choose **Yes (/fsanitize=address)**.

1. Choose **OK** or **Apply** to save your changes.

### To set the **`/fsanitize=fuzzer`** compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open your project's **Property Pages** dialog box.

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **General** property page.

1. Modify the **Enable Fuzzer** property. To enable it, choose **Yes (/fsanitize=fuzzer)**.

1. Choose **OK** or **Apply** to save your changes.

### To set the advanced compiler options

1. Open your project's **Property Pages** dialog box.

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Command Line** property page.

1. Modify the **Additional Options** property to set **/fsanitize-address-use-after-return** or **/fno-sanitize-address-vcasan-lib**.

1. Choose **OK** or **Apply** to save your changes.

### To set this compiler option programmatically
