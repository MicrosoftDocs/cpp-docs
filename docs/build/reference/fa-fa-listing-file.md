# /FA, /Fa (Listing File)

Creates a listing file containing assembler code.

## Syntax

> **/FA**[**c**\][**s**\][**u**]
> **/Fa**_pathname_

## Remarks

The **/FA** compiler option generates an assembler listing file for each translation unit in the compilation, which generally corresponds to a C or C++ source file. By default, only assembler is included in the listing file, which is encoded as ANSI. The optional **c**, **s**, and **u** arguments to **/FA** control whether machine code or source code are output together with the assembler listing, and whether the listing is encoded as UTF-8.

By default, each listing file gets the same base name as the source file, and has a .asm extension. When machine code is included by using the **c** option, the listing file has a .cod extension. You can change the name and extension of the listing file and the directory where it is created by using the **/Fa** option.

### /FA arguments

none  
Only assembler language is included in the listing.

**c**  
Optional. Includes machine code in the listing.

**s**  
Optional. Includes source code in the listing.

**u**  
Optional. Encodes the listing file in UTF-8 format, and includes a byte order marker. By default, the file is encoded as ANSI. Use `u` to create a listing file that displays correctly on any system, or if you are using Unicode source code files as input to the compiler.

If both **s** and **u** are specified, and if a source code file uses a Unicode encoding other than UTF-8, then the code lines in the .asm file may not display correctly.

### /Fa argument

none  
One *source*.asm file is created for each source code file in the compilation.

*filename*  
A listing file named *filename*.asm is placed in the current directory. This is only valid when compiling a single source code file.

*filename.extension*  
A listing file named *filename.extension* is placed in the current directory. This is only valid when compiling a single source code file.

*directory*__\\__  
One *source_file*.asm file is created and placed in the specified *directory* for each source code file in the compilation. Note the required trailing backslash. Only paths on the current disk are allowed.

*directory*__\\__*filename*  
A listing file named *filename*.asm is placed in the specified *directory*. This is only valid when compiling a single source code file.

*directory*__\\__*filename.extension*  
A listing file named *filename.extension* is placed in the specified *directory*. This is only valid when compiling a single source code file.

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).

2. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Output Files** property page.

3. Modify the **Assembler Output** property to set the **/FAc** and **/FAs** options for assembler, machine, and source code. Modify the **Use Unicode For Assembler Listing** property to set the **/FAu** option for ANSI or UTF-8 output. Modify the **ASM List Location** to set the **/Fa** option for listing file name and location.

Note that setting both **Assembler Output** and **Use Unicode For Assembler Listing** properties can cause [Command-Line Warning D9025](../../error-messages/tool-errors/command-line-warning-d9025.md). To combine these options in the IDE, use the **Additional Options** field in the **Command Line** property page instead.

### To set this compiler option programmatically

- See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.AssemblerListingLocation%2A> or <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.AssemblerOutput%2A>. To specify **/FAu**, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.AdditionalOptions%2A>.

## Example
The following command line produces a combined source and machine-code listing called HELLO.cod:

```cmd
CL /FAcs HELLO.CPP
```
