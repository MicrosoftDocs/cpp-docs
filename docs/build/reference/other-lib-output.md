# Other LIB Output

In the default mode, you can use the /LIST option to display information about the resulting library. You can redirect this output to a file.

LIB displays a copyright and version message and echoes command files unless the /NOLOGO option is used.

When you type `lib` with no other input, LIB displays a usage statement that summarizes its options.

Error and warning messages issued by LIB have the form LNK*nnnn*. The LINK, DUMPBIN, and EDITBIN tools also use this range of errors. Help is available by selecting the error in the Output window and pressing F1.
