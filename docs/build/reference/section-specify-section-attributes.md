# /SECTION (Specify Section Attributes)

> **/SECTION:**_name_,[[**!**]{**DEKPRSW**}][**,ALIGN=**_number_]

## Remarks

The **/SECTION** option changes the attributes of a section, overriding the attributes set when the .obj file for the section was compiled.

A *section* in a portable executable (PE) file is a named contiguous block of memory that contains either code or data. Some sections contain code or data that your program declared and uses directly, while other data sections are created for you by the linker and library manager (lib.exe) and contain information vital to the operating system. For more information, see [PE Format](/windows/desktop/Debug/pe-format).

Specify a colon (:) and a section *name*. The *name* is case sensitive.

Do not use the following names, as they conflict with standard names. For example, .sdata is used on RISC platforms:

- .arch

- .bss

- .data

- .edata

- .idata

- .pdata

- .rdata

- .reloc

- .rsrc

- .sbss

- .sdata

- .srdata

- .text

- .xdata

Specify one or more attributes for the section. The attribute characters, listed below, are not case sensitive. You must specify all attributes that you want the section to have; an omitted attribute character causes that attribute bit to be turned off. If you do not specify R, W, or E, the existing read, write, or executable status remains unchanged.

To negate an attribute, precede its character with an exclamation point (!). The meanings of the attribute characters are shown in this table:

|Character|Attribute|Meaning|
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
|E|Execute|The section is executable|
|R|Read|Allows read operations on data|
|W|Write|Allows write operations on data|
|S|Shared|Shares the section among all processes that load the image|
|D|Discardable|Marks the section as discardable|
|K|Cacheable|Marks the section as not cacheable|
|P|Pageable|Marks the section as not pageable|

K and P are unusual in that the section flags that correspond to them are used in the negative sense. If you specify one of them on the .text section by using the **/SECTION:.text,K** option, there is no difference in the section flags when you run [DUMPBIN](../../build/reference/dumpbin-options.md) with the [/HEADERS](../../build/reference/headers.md) option; the section was already implicitly cached. To remove the default, specify **/SECTION:.text,!K** instead. DUMPBIN reveals section characteristics, including "Not Cached."

A section in the PE file that does not have E, R, or W set is probably invalid.

The **ALIGN=**_number_ argument lets you specify an alignment value for a particular section. The _number_ argument is in bytes and must be a power of two. See [/ALIGN](../../build/reference/align-section-alignment.md) for more information.

### To set this linker option in the Visual Studio development environment

1.  Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Setting Visual C++ Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Choose the **Configuration Properties** > **Linker** > **Command Line** property page.

1. Enter the option in the **Additional Options** box. Choose **OK** or **Apply** to apply the change.

### To set this linker option programmatically

- See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCLinkerTool.AdditionalOptions%2A>.
