# /X (Ignore Standard Include Paths)

Prevents the compiler from searching for include files in directories specified in the PATH and INCLUDE environment variables.

## Syntax

```
/X
```

## Remarks

You can use this option with the [/I (Additional Include Directories)](../../build/reference/i-additional-include-directories.md) (**/I**`directory`) option.

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Click the **C/C++** folder.

1. Click the **Preprocessor** property page.

1. Modify the **Ignore Standard Include Path** property.

### To set this compiler option programmatically

- See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.IgnoreStandardIncludePath%2A>.

## Example

In the following command, `/X` tells the compiler to ignore locations specified by the PATH and INCLUDE environment variables, and `/I` specifies the directory in which to look for include files:

```
CL /X /I \ALT\INCLUDE MAIN.C
```
