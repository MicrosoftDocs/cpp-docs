# /Zp (Struct Member Alignment)

Controls how the members of a structure are packed into memory and specifies the same packing for all structures in a module.

## Syntax

> **`/Zp`**[**`1`**|**`2`**|**`4`**|**`8`**|**`16`**]

## Remarks

The **`/ZpN`** option tells the compiler where to store each structure member. The compiler stores members after the first one on a boundary that's the smaller of either the size of the member type, or an *N*-byte boundary.

The available packing values are described in the following table:

|/Zp argument|Effect|
|-|-|
|1|Packs structures on 1-byte boundaries. Same as **`/Zp`**.|
|2|Packs structures on 2-byte boundaries.|
|4|Packs structures on 4-byte boundaries.|
|8|Packs structures on 8-byte boundaries (default for x86, ARM, and ARM64).|
|16| Packs structures on 16-byte boundaries (default for x64 and ARM64EC).|

Don't use this option unless you have specific alignment requirements.

> [!WARNING]
> The C/C++ headers in the Windows SDK assume the platform's default alignment is used. Don't change the setting from the default when you include the Windows SDK headers, either by using **`/Zp`** on the command line or by using `#pragma pack`. Otherwise, your application may cause memory corruption at runtime.

You can also use the [`pack` pragma](../../preprocessor/pack.md) to control structure packing. For more information about alignment, see:

- [`align`](../../cpp/align-cpp.md)

- [`alignof` Operator](../../cpp/alignof-operator.md)

- [`__unaligned`](../../cpp/unaligned.md)

- [`/ALIGN` (Section Alignment)](align-section-alignment.md)

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Set C++ compiler and build properties in Visual Studio](../working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Code Generation** property page.

1. Modify the **Struct Member Alignment** property.

### To set this compiler option programmatically

- See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.StructMemberAlignment%2A>.
