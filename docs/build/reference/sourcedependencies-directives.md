# `/sourceDependencies:directives` (List module and header unit dependencies)

This command-line option scans source files and their `#include` statements to generate a JSON file that lists module export and imports. A build system can use this information to determine the build order of modules and header units.

This option differs from [`/sourceDependencies`](sourcedependencies.md) in the following ways:

- The compiler doesn't produce compiled output. No compiled code, modules, or header units are produced. Instead, the files are scanned for module directives.
- The JSON format is different from what `/sourceDependencies` produces. The `/sourceDependencies` option is intended to be used with other build tools, such as CMake.
- The output JSON file doesn't list imported modules and imported header units (*`.ifc`* files) because this option does a scan of the project files, not a compilation. So there are no built modules or header units to list.
- Only directly imported modules or header units are listed. It doesn't list the dependencies of the imported modules or header units themselves.
- Header file dependencies aren't listed. That is, `#include <file>` or `#include "file"` dependencies aren't listed.
- `/sourceDependencies:directives` is meant to be used before *`.ifc`* files are built.
- `/sourceDependencies` causes the compiler to report all of the files, such as `#includes`, `.pch` files, `.ifc` files, and so on, that were used for a particular translation unit, whereas `/sourceDependencies:directives [file1]` scans the specified source file and reports all `import` and `export` statements. `/sourceDependencies` can be used with `/sourceDependencies:directives`.

## Syntax

> **`/sourceDependencies:directives-`**\
> **`/sourceDependencies:directives`** *filename*\
> **`/sourceDependencies:directives`** *directory*

## Arguments

*`-`*\
If the single dash is provided, then the compiler will emit the source dependencies JSON to `stdout`, or to where compiler output is redirected.

*`filename`*\
The compiler writes the source dependency output to the specified filename, which may include a relative or absolute path. The file is created if it doesn't exist.

*`directory`*\
If the argument is a directory, the compiler generates source dependency files in the specified directory. The directory must exist, or the argument is treated as a *`filename`*. The output file name is based on the full name of the input file, with an appended *`.json`* extension. For example, if the file provided to the compiler is *`main.cpp`*, the generated output filename is *`main.cpp.json`*.

## Remarks

**`/sourceDependencies:directives`** is available starting in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.10.

When you specify the [`/MP` (Build with multiple processes)](mp-build-with-multiple-processes.md) compiler option, we recommend that you use **`/sourceDependencies:directives`** with a directory argument. This option makes the compiler output a separate *`*.module.json`* file for each source file. If you provide a single filename argument, two instances of the compiler may attempt to open the output file simultaneously and cause an error. Use of **`/MP`** with **`/sourceDependencies:directives-`** to send output to `stdout` could cause interleaved results.

When a non-fatal compiler error occurs, the dependency information still gets written to the output file.

All file paths appear as absolute paths in the output.

This switch can be used with [`/translateInclude`](translateinclude.md).

### Examples

Given the following sample code:

```cpp
//main.cpp:
#include <vector>

import m;
import std;
import <utility>;
import "t.h";

int main() {}
```

This following command line:

`cl /std:c++latest /translateInclude /sourceDependencies:directives output.json main.cpp`

produces a JSON file *`output.json`* similar to:

```JSON
{
   "Version":"1.1",
   "Data":{
      "Source":"C:\\test\\main.cpp",
      "ProvidedModule":"",
      "ImportedModules":[
         "m",
         "std"
      ],
      "ImportedHeaderUnits":[
         "C:\\...\\utility",
         "C:\\...\\vector",
         "C:\\test\\t.h"
      ]
   }
}
```

For brevity, the previous example uses `...` to abbreviate the reported paths. The report contains the absolute paths. The paths reported depend on where the compiler finds the dependencies. If the results are unexpected, you might want to check your project's include path settings.

`ProvidedModule` lists exported module or module partition names.

No *`.ifc`* files are listed in the output because they weren't built. Unlike `/sourceDependencies`, the compiler doesn't produce compiled output when `/sourceDependencies:directives` is specified, so no compiled modules or header units are produced.

## To set this compiler option in Visual Studio

You normally shouldn't set this option yourself in the Visual Studio development environment. The build system sets it.
