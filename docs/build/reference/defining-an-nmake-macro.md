# Define an NMAKE macro

An NMAKE macro is defined by using this syntax:

```makefile
macro_name=string
```

The *macro_name* is a case-sensitive combination of letters, digits, and underscores (**`_`**) up to 1,024 characters long. The *macro_name* can contain an invoked macro. If *macro_name* consists entirely of an invoked macro, the macro being invoked can't be null or undefined.

The *string* can be any sequence of zero or more characters. A *null* string contains zero characters or only spaces or tabs. The *string* can contain a macro invocation.

## <a name="special-characters-in-macros"></a> Special characters in macros

A number sign (**`#`**) after a definition specifies a comment. To specify a literal number sign in a macro, use a caret (**`^`**) to escape it, as in **`^#`**.

A dollar sign (**`$`**) specifies a macro invocation. To specify a literal `$`, use **`$$`**.

To extend a definition to a new line, end the line with a backslash (**`\`**). When the macro is invoked, the backslash and following newline character is replaced with a space. To specify a literal backslash at the end of the line, precede it with a caret (**`^`**) escape, or follow it with a comment specifier (**`#`**).

To specify a literal newline character, end the line with a caret (**`^`**) escape, as in this example:

```makefile
CMDS = cls^
dir
```

## <a name="null-and-undefined-macros"></a> Null and undefined macros

Both null and undefined macros expand to null strings, but a macro defined as a null string is considered defined in preprocessing expressions. To define a macro as a null string, specify no characters except spaces or tabs after the equal sign (**`=`**) in a command line or command file, and enclose the null string or definition in double quotation marks (**`" "`**). To undefine a macro, use **`!UNDEF`**. For more information, see [Makefile preprocessing directives](makefile-preprocessing.md#makefile-preprocessing-directives).

## <a name="where-to-define-macros"></a> Where to define macros

Define macros in a command line, command file, makefile, or the *`Tools.ini`* file.

In a makefile or the *`Tools.ini`* file, each macro definition must appear on a separate line and can't start with a space or tab. Spaces or tabs around the equal sign are ignored. All *string* characters are literal, including surrounding quotation marks and embedded spaces.

In a command line or command file, spaces and tabs delimit arguments and can't surround the equal sign. If *string* has embedded spaces or tabs, enclose either the string itself or the entire macro in double quotation marks (**`" "`**).

## <a name="precedence-in-macro-definitions"></a> Precedence in macro definitions

If a macro has multiple definitions, NMAKE uses the highest-precedence definition. The following list shows the order of precedence, from highest to lowest:

1. A macro defined on the command line

1. A macro defined in a makefile or include file

1. An inherited environment-variable macro

1. A macro defined in the *`Tools.ini`* file

1. A predefined macro, such as [`CC`](special-nmake-macros.md#command-macros-and-options-macros) and [`AS`](special-nmake-macros.md#command-macros-and-options-macros)

Use **`/E`** to cause macros inherited from environment variables to override makefile macros with the same name. Use **`!UNDEF`** to override a command line.
