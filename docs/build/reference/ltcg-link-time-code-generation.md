# /LTCG (Link-time Code Generation)

Use **/LTCG** to perform whole-program optimization, or to create profile-guided optimization (PGO) instrumentation, perform training, and create profile-guided optimized builds.

## Syntax

> **/LTCG**[**:**{**INCREMENTAL**|**NOSTATUS**|**STATUS**|**OFF**}]<br/>

These options are deprecated starting in Visual Studio 2015:

> **/LTCG:**{**PGINSTRUMENT**|**PGOPTIMIZE**|**PGUPDATE**}<br/>

### Arguments

**INCREMENTAL** (optional)<br/>
Specifies that the linker only applies whole program optimization or link-time code generation (LTCG) to the set of files affected by an edit, instead of the entire project. By default, this flag is not set when **/LTCG** is specified, and the entire project is linked by using whole program optimization.

**NOSTATUS** &#124; **STATUS** (optional)<br/>
Specifies whether the linker displays a progress indicator that shows what percentage of the link is complete. By default, this status information is not displayed.

**OFF** (optional)<br/>
Disables link-time code generation. This behavior is the same as when **/LTCG** is not specified on the command line.

**PGINSTRUMENT** (optional)<br/>
This option is deprecated starting in Visual Studio 2015. Instead, use **/LTCG** and [/GENPROFILE or /FASTGENPROFILE](genprofile-fastgenprofile-generate-profiling-instrumented-build.md) to generate an instrumented build for profile-guided optimization. The data that is collected from instrumented runs is used to create an optimized image. For more information, see [Profile Guided Optimization](profile-guided-optimizations.md). The short form of this option is **/LTCG:PGI**.

**PGOPTIMIZE** (optional)<br/>
This option is deprecated starting in Visual Studio 2015. Instead, use **/LTCG** and  [/USEPROFILE](useprofile.md) to build an optimized image. For more information, see [Profile Guided Optimization](../../build/reference/profile-guided-optimizations.md). The short form of this option is **/LTCG:PGO**.

**PGUPDATE** (optional)<br/>
This option is deprecated starting in Visual Studio 2015. Instead, use **/LTCG** and  **/USEPROFILE** to rebuild an optimized image. For more information, see [Profile Guided Optimization](../../build/reference/profile-guided-optimizations.md). The short form of this option is **/LTCG:PGU**.

## Remarks

The **/LTCG** option tells the linker to call the compiler and perform whole-program optimization. You can also do profile guided optimization. For more information, see [Profile Guided Optimization](../../build/reference/profile-guided-optimizations.md).

With the following exceptions, you cannot add linker options to the PGO combination of **/LTCG** and **/USEPROFILE** that were not specified in the previous PGO initialization combination of **/LTCG** and **/GENPROFILE** options:

- [/BASE](../../build/reference/base-base-address.md)

- [/FIXED](../../build/reference/fixed-fixed-base-address.md)

- **/LTCG**

- [/MAP](../../build/reference/map-generate-mapfile.md)

- [/MAPINFO](../../build/reference/mapinfo-include-information-in-mapfile.md)

- [/NOLOGO](../../build/reference/nologo-suppress-startup-banner-linker.md)

- [/OUT](../../build/reference/out-output-file-name.md)

- [/PGD](../../build/reference/pgd-specify-database-for-profile-guided-optimizations.md)

- [/PDB](../../build/reference/pdb-use-program-database.md)

- [/PDBSTRIPPED](../../build/reference/pdbstripped-strip-private-symbols.md)

- [/STUB](../../build/reference/stub-ms-dos-stub-file-name.md)

- [/VERBOSE](../../build/reference/verbose-print-progress-messages.md)

Any linker options that are specified together with the **/LTCG** and **/GENPROFILE** options to initialize PGO do not have to be specified when you build by using **/LTCG** and **/USEPROFILE**; they are implied.

The rest of this article discusses **/LTCG** in terms of link-time code generation.

**/LTCG** is implied with [/GL](../../build/reference/gl-whole-program-optimization.md).

The linker invokes link-time code generation if it is passed a module that was compiled by using **/GL** or an MSIL module (see [.netmodule Files as Linker Input](../../build/reference/netmodule-files-as-linker-input.md)). If you do not explicitly specify **/LTCG** when you pass **/GL** or MSIL modules to the linker, the linker eventually detects this and restarts the link by using **/LTCG**. Explicitly specify **/LTCG** when you pass **/GL** and MSIL modules to the linker for the fastest possible build performance.

For even faster performance, use **/LTCG:INCREMENTAL**. This option tells the linker to only re-optimize the set of files that is affected by a source file change, instead of the entire project. This can significantly reduce the link time required. This is not the same option as incremental linking.

**/LTCG** is not valid for use with [/INCREMENTAL](../../build/reference/incremental-link-incrementally.md).

When **/LTCG** is used to link modules compiled by using [/Og](../../build/reference/og-global-optimizations.md), [/O1](../../build/reference/o1-o2-minimize-size-maximize-speed.md), [/O2](../../build/reference/o1-o2-minimize-size-maximize-speed.md), or [/Ox](../../build/reference/ox-full-optimization.md), the following optimizations are performed:

- Cross-module inlining

- Interprocedural register allocation (64-bit operating systems only)

- Custom calling convention (x86 only)

- Small TLS displacement (x86 only)

- Stack double alignment (x86 only)

- Improved memory disambiguation (better interference information for global variables and input parameters)

> [!NOTE]
> The linker determines which optimizations were used to compile each function and applies the same optimizations at link time.

Using **/LTCG** and **/Ogt** causes double-alignment optimization.

If **/LTCG** and **/Ogs** are specified, double alignment is not performed. If most of the functions in an application are compiled for speed, with a few functions compiled for size (for example, by using the [optimize](../../preprocessor/optimize.md) pragma), the compiler double-aligns the functions that are optimized for size if they call functions that require double alignment.

If the compiler can identify all of the call sites of a function, the compiler ignores explicit calling-convention modifiers on a function and tries to optimize the function's calling convention:

- pass parameters in registers

- reorder parameters for alignment

- remove unused parameters

If a function is called through a function pointer, or if a function is called from outside a module that is compiled by using **/GL**, the compiler does not attempt to optimize the function's calling convention.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use **/LTCG** and redefine `mainCRTStartup`, your application can have unpredictable behavior that relates to user code that executes before global objects are initialized. There are three ways to address this issue: do not redefine `mainCRTStartup`, do not compile the file that contains `mainCRTStartup` by using **/LTCG**, or initialize global variables and objects statically.

### /LTCG and MSIL Modules

Modules that are compiled by using [/GL](../../build/reference/gl-whole-program-optimization.md) and [/clr](../../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md) can be used as input to the linker when **/LTCG** is specified.

- **/LTCG** can accept native object files, and mixed native/managed object files (compiled by using **/clr**). The **/clr:pure** and **/clr:safe** compiler options are deprecated in Visual Studio 2015 and unsupported in Visual Studio 2017.

- **/LTCG:PGI** does not accept native modules compiled by using **/GL** and **/clr**

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the project **Property Pages** dialog box. See [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **General** property page.

1. Modify the **Whole Program Optimization** property.

You can also apply **/LTCG** to specific builds by choosing **Build** > **Profile Guided Optimization** on the menu bar, or by choosing one of the Profile Guided Optimization options on the shortcut menu for the project.

### To set this compiler option programmatically

- See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCLinkerTool.LinkTimeCodeGeneration%2A>.
