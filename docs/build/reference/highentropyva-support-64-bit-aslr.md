# /HIGHENTROPYVA (Support 64-Bit ASLR)
Specifies that the executable image supports high-entropy 64-bit address space layout randomization (ASLR).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
/HIGHENTROPYVA[:NO]  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 By default, /HIGHENTROPYVA is on for 64-bit executable images. It is not applicable to 32-bit executable images. To enable this option, /DYNAMICBASE must also be on.  
  
 /HIGHENTROPYVA modifies the header of a .dll file or .exe file to indicate whether ASLR with 64-bit addresses is supported. When this option is set on an executable and all of the modules that it depends on, an operating system that supports 64-bit ASLR can rebase the segments of the executable image at load time by using randomized addresses in a 64-bit virtual address space. This large address space makes it more difficult for an attacker to guess the location of a particular memory region.  
  
### To set this linker option in Visual Studio  
  
1.  Open the project **Property Pages** dialog box. For more information, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  
  
2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node.  
  
3.  Expand the **Linker** node.  
  
4.  Select the **Command Line** property page.  
  
5.  In **Additional Options**, enter `/HIGHENTROPYVA` or `/HIGHENTROPYVA:NO`.
