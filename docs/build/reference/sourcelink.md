## Arguments

Specifies a JSON-formatted configuration file that contains a simple mapping of local file paths to URLs where the source file can be retrieved for display by the debugger.

For information on how to use SourceLink in your projects and how to generate the SourceLink file as part of your project, see [Using SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink#using-sourcelink).
