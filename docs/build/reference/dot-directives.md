# Dot Directives

Specify dot directives outside a description block, at the start of a line. Dot directives begin with a period ( . ) and are followed by a colon (:). Spaces and tabs are allowed. Dot directive names are case sensitive and are uppercase.

|Directive|Purpose|
|---------------|-------------|
|**.IGNORE :**|Ignores nonzero exit codes returned by commands, from the place it is specified to the end of the makefile. By default, NMAKE halts if a command returns a nonzero exit code. To restore error checking, use **!CMDSWITCHES**. To ignore the exit code for a single command, use the dash (-) modifier. To ignore exit codes for an entire file, use /I.|
|**.PRECIOUS :** *targets*|Preserves *targets* on disk if the commands to update them are halted; has no effect if a command handles an interrupt by deleting the file. Separate the target names with one or more spaces or tabs. By default, NMAKE deletes a target if a build is interrupted by CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK. Each use of **.PRECIOUS** applies to the entire makefile; multiple specifications are cumulative.|
|**.SILENT :**|Suppresses display of executed commands, from the place it is specified to the end of the makefile. By default, NMAKE displays the commands it invokes. To restore echoing, use **!CMDSWITCHES**. To suppress echoing of a single command, use the **@** modifier. To suppress echoing for an entire file, use /S.|
|**.SUFFIXES :** `list`|Lists extensions for inference-rule matching; predefined to include the following extensions: .exe .obj .asm .c .cpp .cxx .bas .cbl .for .pas .res .rc .f .f90|

To change the **.SUFFIXES** list order or to specify a new list, clear the list and specify a new setting. To clear the list, specify no extensions after the colon:

```
.SUFFIXES :
```

To add additional suffixes to the end of the list, specify

```
.SUFFIXES : suffixlist
```

where *suffixlist* is a list of the additional suffixes, separated by one or more spaces or tabs. To see the current setting of **.SUFFIXES**, run NMAKE with /P.
