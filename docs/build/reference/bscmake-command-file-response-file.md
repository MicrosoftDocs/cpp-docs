# BSCMAKE Command File (Response File)

You can provide part or all of the command-line input in a command file. Specify the command file using the following syntax:

```  
BSCMAKE @filename
```  

Only one command file is allowed. You can specify a path with *filename*. Precede *filename* with an at sign (**\@**). BSCMAKE does not assume an extension. You can specify additional *sbrfiles* on the command line after *filename*. The command file is a text file that contains the input to BSCMAKE in the same order as you would specify it on the command line. Separate the command-line arguments with one or more spaces, tabs, or newline characters.

The following command calls BSCMAKE using a command file:

```  
BSCMAKE @prog1.txt
```  

The following is a sample command file:

```  
/n /v /o main.bsc /El
/S (  
toolbox.h
verdate.h c:\src\inc\screen.h
)
file1.sbr file2.sbr file3.sbr file4.sbr
```
