## Remarks

Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) is a computer processor feature that provides capabilities to defend against certain kinds of malware attacks. For more information, see [Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology Preview](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf).

The **/CETCOMPAT** linker option tells the linker to mark the binary as CET-compatible. **/CETCOMPAT:NO** marks the binary as not compatible with CET. If both options are specified on the command line, the last one specified is used. This switch is currently only applicable to x86 and x64 architectures.

The **/CETCOMPAT** option is available beginning in the Visual Studio 2019 Preview 3 toolset.
