# C/C++ Building Reference
Visual C++ provides two ways of building a C/C++ program. The easiest (and most common) way is to [build within the Visual C++ development environment](../../ide/building-cpp-projects-in-visual-studio.md). The other way is to [build from a command prompt using command-line tools](../../build/building-on-the-command-line.md). In either case, you can create your source files using the Visual C++ source editor or a third-party editor of your choice.  
  
 If your program uses a makefile rather than a .vcxproj file, you can still build it in the development environment as an [external project](../../ide/building-external-projects.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Compiling a C/C++ Program](../../build/reference/compiling-a-c-cpp-program.md)  
 Describes the compiler, which creates an object file containing machine code, linker directives, sections, external references, and function/data names.  
  
 [Linking](../../build/reference/linking.md)  
 Describes the linker, which combines code from the object files created by the compiler and from statically linked libraries, resolves the name references, and creates an executable file.  
  
 [Release Builds](../../build/reference/release-builds.md)  
 Presents information on why and when you would want to change from a debug build to a release build and also discusses some of the problems you may encounter when changing from a debug to a release build.  
  
 [Optimizing Your Code](../../build/reference/optimizing-your-code.md)  
 Provides links to topics discussing the mechanisms for optimizing code:  
  
 [C/C++ Build Tools](../../build/reference/c-cpp-build-tools.md)  
 Provides the following command-line tools for viewing or manipulating build output:  
  
 [C/C++ Build Errors](../../error-messages/compiler-errors-1/c-cpp-build-errors.md)  
 Introduces the build errors section in the table of contents.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [C/C++ Preprocessor Reference](../../preprocessor/c-cpp-preprocessor-reference.md)  
 Discusses the preprocessor, which prepares source files for the compiler by translating macros, operators, and directives.  
  
 [Understanding Custom Build Steps and Build Events](../../ide/understanding-custom-build-steps-and-build-events.md)  
 Discusses customizing the build process.  
  
 [Building a C/C++ Program](../../build/building-c-cpp-programs.md)  
 Provides links to topics describing building your program from the command line or from the integrated development environment of Visual Studio.  
  
 [Setting Compiler Options](../../build/reference/setting-compiler-options.md)  
 Describes setting compiler options in the development environment or on the command line.  
  
 [Compiler Options](../../build/reference/compiler-options.md)  
 Provides links to topics discussing using compiler options.  
  
 [Setting Linker Options](../../build/reference/setting-linker-options.md)  
 Describes setting linker options inside or outside the integrated development environment.  
  
 [Linker Options](../../build/reference/linker-options.md)  
 Provides links to topics discussing using linker options.  
  
 [BSCMAKE Reference](../../build/reference/bscmake-reference.md)  
 Describes the Microsoft Browse Information Maintenance Utility (BSCMAKE.EXE), which builds a browse information file (.bsc) from .sbr files created during compilation.  
  
 [LIB Reference](../../build/reference/lib-reference.md)  
 Describes the Microsoft Library Manager (LIB.exe), which creates and manages a library of Common Object File Format (COFF) object files.  
  
 [EDITBIN Reference](../../build/reference/editbin-reference.md)  
 Describes the Microsoft COFF Binary File Editor (EDITBIN.EXE), which modifies Common Object File Format (COFF) binary files.  
  
 [DUMPBIN Reference](../../build/reference/dumpbin-reference.md)  
 Describes the Microsoft COFF Binary File Dumper (DUMPBIN.EXE), which displays information about Common Object File Format (COFF) binary files.  
  
 [NMAKE Reference](../../build/nmake-reference.md)  
 Describes the Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE.EXE), which is a tool that builds projects based on commands contained in a description file.
