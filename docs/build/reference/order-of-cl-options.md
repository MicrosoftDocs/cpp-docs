# Order of CL Options

Options can appear anywhere on the CL command line, except for the /link option, which must occur last. The compiler begins with options specified in the [CL environment variable](../../build/reference/cl-environment-variables.md) and then reads the command line from left to right â€” processing command files in the order it encounters them. Each option applies to all files on the command line. If CL encounters conflicting options, it uses the rightmost option.
