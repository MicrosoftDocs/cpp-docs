# /arch (ARM)

Specifies the architecture for code generation on ARM. See also [/arch (x86)](../../build/reference/arch-x86.md) and [/arch (x64)](../../build/reference/arch-x64.md).

## Syntax

```
/arch:[ARMv7VE|VFPv4]
```

## Arguments

**/arch:ARMv7VE**<br/>
Enables the use of ARMv7VE Virtualization Extensions instructions.

**/arch:VFPv4**<br/>
Enables the use of ARM VFPv4 instructions. If this option is not specified, VFPv3 is the default.

## Remarks

The `_M_ARM_FP` macro (for ARM only) indicates which, if any, **/arch** compiler option was used. For more information, see [Predefined Macros](../../preprocessor/predefined-macros.md).

When you use [/clr](../../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md) to compile, **/arch** has no effect on code generation for managed functions. **/arch** only affects code generation for native functions.

### To set the /arch:ARMv7VE or /arch:VFPv4 compiler option in Visual Studio

1. Open the **Property Pages** dialog box for the project. For more information, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Select the **C/C++** folder.

1. Select the **Command Line** property page.

1. In the **Additional options** box, add `/arch:ARMv7VE` or `/arch:VFPv4`.

### To set this compiler option programmatically

- See <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VCProjectEngine.VCCLCompilerTool.EnableEnhancedInstructionSet%2A>.
