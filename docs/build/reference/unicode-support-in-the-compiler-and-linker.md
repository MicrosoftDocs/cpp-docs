# Unicode Support in the Compiler and Linker

Most Visual C++ build tools support Unicode inputs and outputs.

## Filenames

Filenames specified on the command line or in compiler directives (such as `#include`) may contain Unicode characters.

## Source code files

Unicode characters are supported in identifiers, macros, string and character literals, and in comments.  Universal character names are also supported.

Unicode can be input into a source code file in the following encodings:

- UTF-16 little endian with or without byte order mark (BOM)

- UTF-16 big endian with or without BOM

- UTF-8 with BOM

## Output

During compilation, the compiler outputs diagnostics to the console in UTF-16.  The characters that can be displayed at your console depend on the console window properties.  Compiler output redirected to a file is in the current ANSI console codepage.

## Linker response files and .DEF files

Response files and DEF files can be either UTF-16 with a BOM, or ANSI.

## .asm and .cod dumps

.asm and .cod dumps are in ANSI by default for compatibility with MASM. Use [/FAu](../../build/reference/fa-fa-listing-file.md) to output UTF-8. Note that if you specify **/FAs**, the intermingled source will just be directly printed and may look garbled, for example if source code is UTF-8 and you didn't specify **/FAsu**.
