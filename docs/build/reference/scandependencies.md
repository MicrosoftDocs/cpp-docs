# `/scanDependencies` (List module dependencies in standard form)

This compiler option generates a JSON file that lists module and header-unit dependencies according to C++ Standard proposal [`P1689R5 Format for describing dependencies of source files`](https://wg21.link/P1689r5).

## Syntax

> **`/scanDependencies-`**\
> **`/scanDependencies`** *`filename`*\
> **`/scanDependencies`** *`directory`*

## Arguments

*`-`*\
If the single dash is provided, then the compiler emits the source dependencies JSON to `stdout`, or to where compiler output is redirected.

*`filename`*\
The compiler writes the source dependency output to the specified filename, which may include a relative or absolute path. The file is created if it doesn't exist.

*`directory`*\
If the argument is a directory, the compiler generates source dependency files in the specified directory. The directory must exist, or the argument is treated as a *`filename`*. The output file name is based on the full name of the input file, with an appended *`.module.json`* extension. For example, if the file provided to the compiler is *`main.cpp`*, the generated output filename is *`main.cpp.module.json`*.

## Remarks

The **`/scanDependencies`** compiler option identifies which dependencies, modules, and header units must be compiled before you can compile the project that uses them. For instance, it lists `import <library>;` or `import "library";` as a header unit dependency, and `import name;` as a module dependency. The intent is to provide this information in a common format consumable by build tools such as CMake. To report module and header unit dependencies, you must also compile by using [`/std:c++20`](std-specify-language-standard-version.md) or later.

This command-line option is similar to [`/sourceDependencies:directives`](sourcedependencies-directives.md) and [`/sourceDependencies`](sourcedependencies.md), but differs in the following ways:

- The output uses the [`P1689R5`](https://wg21.link/P1689r5) schema, instead of the Microsoft-specific schema generated by **`/sourceDependencies:directives`**.
- Unlike **`/sourceDependencies`**, the compiler doesn't produce compiled output. Instead, the files are scanned for module directives. No compiled code, modules, or header units are produced.
- The output JSON file doesn't list imported modules and imported header units (*`.ifc`* files) because this option only scans the project files. There are no built modules or header units to list.
- Only directly imported modules or header units are listed. It doesn't list the dependencies of the imported modules or header units themselves.
- Textually included header files such as `#include <file>` or `#include "file"` aren't listed as dependencies unless translated to a header unit by using the [`/translateInclude`](translateinclude.md) option.
- **`/scanDependencies`** is meant to be used before *`.ifc`* files are built.

**`/scanDependencies`** is available starting in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.2. It's not enabled by default.

When you specify the [`/MP` (Build with multiple processes)](mp-build-with-multiple-processes.md) compiler option, we recommend that you use **`/scanDependencies`** with a directory argument. If you provide a single filename argument, two instances of the compiler may attempt to open the output file simultaneously and cause an error. Use of **`/MP`** with **`/scanDependencies-`** to send output to `stdout` could cause interleaved results.

When a non-fatal compiler error occurs, the dependency information still gets written to the output file.

All file paths appear as absolute paths in the output.

For details on the format and schema used in the output JSON file, see [`P1689R5`](https://wg21.link/P1689r5#_format) section 6.

### Examples

Consider the following sample code:

```cpp
//app.cpp:
#include <vector>

import other.module;
import std.core;

import "t.h";

import <iostream>;

int main() {}
```

You can use this command line to report dependencies in *`app.cpp`*:

> `cl /std:c++latest /scanDependencies output.json app.cpp`

The compiler produces a JSON file, *`output.json`*, with content similar to:

```JSON
{
    "version": 1,
    "revision": 0,
    "rules": [
        {
            "primary-output": "app.obj",
            "outputs": [
                "C:\\Users\\username\\source\\repos\\app\\app"
            ],
            "requires": [
                {
                    "logical-name": "other.module"
                },
                {
                    "logical-name": "std.core"
                },
                {
                    "logical-name": "t.h",
                    "source-path": "C:\\Users\\username\\source\\repos\\app\\app\\t.h",
                    "lookup-method": "include-quote",
                    "unique-on-source-path": true
                },
                {
                    "logical-name": "iostream",
                    "source-path": "C:\\Program Files\\...\\include\\iostream",
                    "lookup-method": "include-angle",
                    "unique-on-source-path": true
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

We've used `...` to abbreviate the reported paths. The report contains the absolute paths. The paths reported depend on where the compiler finds the dependencies. If the results are unexpected, you may want to check your project's include path settings.

No *`.ifc`* files are listed in the output because they weren't built. Unlike **`/sourceDependencies`**, the compiler doesn't produce compiled output when **`/scanDependencies`** is specified, so no compiled modules or header units are produced to import.

## To set this compiler option in Visual Studio

You normally shouldn't set the **`/scanDependencies`** option in the Visual Studio development environment. The compiler doesn't generate object files when you set this option, which makes the link step fail and report an error.

1. Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For more information, see [Set compiler and build properties](../working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Command Line** property page.

1. Modify the **Additional Options** property to add *`/scanDependencies-`* or *`/scanDependencies "pathname"`*, where *`"pathname"`* refers to a directory for output.

1. Choose **OK** to save your changes.

To report module and header unit dependencies, you must also set the **Configuration Properties** > **General** > **C++ Language Standard** property to **ISO C++20 Standard** or later.
