# Targets in Multiple Description Blocks

To update a target in more than one description block using different commands, specify two consecutive colons (::) between targets and dependents.

```
target.lib :: one.asm two.asm three.asm
    ml one.asm two.asm three.asm
    lib target one.obj two.obj three.obj
target.lib :: four.c five.c
    cl /c four.c five.c
    lib target four.obj five.obj
```
