# Targets in Multiple Description Blocks
To update a target in more than one description block using different commands, specify two consecutive colons (::) between targets and dependents.  
  
```  
target.lib :: one.asm two.asm three.asm  
    ml one.asm two.asm three.asm  
    lib target one.obj two.obj three.obj  
target.lib :: four.c five.c  
    cl /c four.c five.c  
    lib target four.obj five.obj  
```
