# Dependents

In a dependency line, specify zero or more dependents after the colon (:) or double colon (::), using any valid filename or [pseudotarget](../build/pseudotargets.md). Separate multiple dependents with one or more spaces or tabs. Dependents are not case sensitive. Paths are permitted with filenames.
