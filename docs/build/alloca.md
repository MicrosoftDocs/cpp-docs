# alloca
[_alloca](../c-runtime-library/reference/alloca.md) is required to be 16-byte aligned and additionally required to use a frame pointer.  
  
 The stack that is allocated needs to include space below it for parameters of subsequently called functions, as discussed in [Stack Allocation](../build/stack-allocation.md).
