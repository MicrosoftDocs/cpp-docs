# Using an NMAKE Macro

To use a macro, enclose its name in parentheses preceded by a dollar sign ($) as follows.

## Syntax

```
$(macroname)
```

## Remarks

No spaces are allowed. The parentheses are optional if *macroname* is a single character. The definition string replaces $(*macroname*); an undefined macro is replaced by a null string.
