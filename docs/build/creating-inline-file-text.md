# Creating Inline File Text

Inline files are temporary or permanent.

## Syntax

```
inlinetext
.
.
.
<<[KEEP | NOKEEP]
```

## Remarks

Specify *inlinetext* on the first line after the command. Mark the end with double angle brackets (<<) at the beginning of a separate line. The file contains all *inlinetext* before the delimiting brackets. The *inlinetext* can have macro expansions and substitutions, but not directives or makefile comments. Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are treated literally.

A temporary file exists for the duration of the session and can be reused by other commands. Specify **KEEP** after the closing angle brackets to retain the file after the NMAKE session; an unnamed file is preserved on disk with the generated filename. Specify **NOKEEP** or nothing for a temporary file. **KEEP** and **NOKEEP** are not case sensitive.
