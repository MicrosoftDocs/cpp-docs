# Importing Data Using __declspec(dllimport)
In the case of data, using **__declspec(dllimport)** is a convenience item that removes a layer of indirection. When you import data from a DLL, you still have to go through the import address table. Before **__declspec(dllimport)**, this meant you had to remember to do an extra level of indirection when accessing data exported from the DLL:  
  
```  
// project.h  
#ifdef _DLL   // If accessing the data from inside the DLL  
   ULONG ulDataInDll;  
  
#else         // If accessing the data from outside the DLL  
   ULONG *ulDataInDll;  
#endif  
```  
  
 You would then export the data in your .DEF file:  
  
```  
// project.def  
LIBRARY project  
EXPORTS  
   ulDataInDll   CONSTANT  
```  
  
 and access it outside the DLL:  
  
```  
if (*ulDataInDll == 0L)   
{  
   // Do stuff here  
}  
```  
  
 When you mark the data as **__declspec(dllimport)**, the compiler automatically generates the indirection code for you. You no longer have to worry about the steps above. As stated previously, do not use **__declspec(dllimport)** declaration on the data when building the DLL. Functions within the DLL do not use the import address table to access the data object; therefore, you will not have the extra level of indirection present.  
  
 To export the data automatically from the DLL, use this declaration:  
  
```  
__declspec(dllexport) ULONG ulDataInDLL;  
```
