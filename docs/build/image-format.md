# Image Format
The executable image format is PE32+. Executable images (both DLLs and EXEs) are restricted to a maximum size of 2 gigabytes, so relative addressing with a 32-bit displacement can be used to address static image data. This data includes the import address table, string constants, static global data, and so on.
