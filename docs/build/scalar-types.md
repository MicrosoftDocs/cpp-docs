# Scalar Types
Although the access of data can stem from any alignment, it is recommended that data be aligned on its natural boundary to avoid performance loss (or a multiple thereof). Enums are constant integers and are treated as 32-bit integers. The following table describes the type definition and recommended storage for it as it pertains to alignment using the following alignment values:  
  
-   Byte - 8 bits  
  
-   Word - 16 bits  
  
-   Double Word - 32 bits  
  
-   Quad Word - 64 bits  
  
-   Octa Word - 128 bits

|-|-|-|-|  
|Scalar Type|C Data Type|Storage Size (in bytes)|Recommended Alignment|  
|**INT8**|**char**|1|Byte|  
|**UINT8**|**unsigned char**|1|Byte|  
|**INT16**|**short**|2|Word|  
|**UINT16**|**unsigned short**|2|Word|  
|**INT32**|**int**, **long**|4|Doubleword|  
|**UINT32**|**unsigned int, unsigned long**|4|Doubleword|  
|**INT64**|**__int64**|8|Quadword|  
|**UINT64**|**unsigned __int64**|8|Quadword|  
|**FP32 (single precision)**|**float**|4|Doubleword|  
|**FP64 (double precision)**|**double**|8|Quadword|  
|**POINTER**|<strong>\*</strong>|8|Quadword|  
|**__m64**|**struct __m64**|8|Quadword|  
|**__m128**|**struct __m128**|16|Octaword|
