# Multiple Targets

NMAKE evaluates multiple targets in a single dependency as if each were specified in a separate description block.

For example, this...

```Output
bounce.exe leap.exe : jump.obj
   echo Building...
```

...is evaluated as this:

```Output
bounce.exe : jump.obj
   echo Building...
leap.exe : jump.obj
   echo Building...
```
