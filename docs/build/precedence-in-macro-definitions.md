# Precedence in Macro Definitions

If a macro has multiple definitions, NMAKE uses the highest-precedence definition. The following list shows the order of precedence, from highest to lowest:

1. A macro defined on the command line

1. A macro defined in a makefile or include file

1. An inherited environment-variable macro

1. A macro defined in the Tools.ini file

1. A predefined macro, such as [CC](../build/command-macros-and-options-macros.md) and [AS](../build/command-macros-and-options-macros.md)

Use /E to cause macros inherited from environment variables to override makefile macros with the same name. Use **!UNDEF** to override a command line.
