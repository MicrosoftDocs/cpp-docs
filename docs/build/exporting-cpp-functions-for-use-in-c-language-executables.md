# Exporting C++ Functions for Use in C-Language Executables
If you have functions in a DLL written in C++ that you want to access from a C-language module, you should declare these functions with C linkage instead of C++ linkage. Unless otherwise specified, the C++ compiler uses C++ type-safe naming (also known as name decoration) and C++ calling conventions, which can be difficult to call from C.  
  
 To specify C linkage, specify **extern** "**C**" for your function declarations. For example:  
  
```  
extern "C" __declspec( dllexport ) int MyFunc(long parm1);  
```
