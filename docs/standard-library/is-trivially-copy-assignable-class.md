# is_trivially_copy_assignable Class

Tests whether the type has a trivial copy assignment operator.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class Ty>
struct is_trivially_copy_assignable;
```

### Parameters

*T*
 The type to query.

## Remarks

An instance of the type predicate holds true if the type *T* is a class that has a trivial copy assignment operator, otherwise it holds false.

An assignment constructor for a class *T* is trivial if it is implicitly provided, the class *T* has no virtual functions, the class *T* has no virtual bases, the classes of all the non-static data members of class type have trivial assignment operators, and the classes of all the non-static data members of type array of class have trivial assignment operators.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<type_traits>

**Namespace:** std
