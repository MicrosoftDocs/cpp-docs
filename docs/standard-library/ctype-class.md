# ctype Class

A class that provides a facet that is used to classify characters, convert from upper and lower cases, and convert between the native character set and that set used by the locale.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class CharType>
class ctype : public ctype_base;
```

### Parameters

*CharType*
 The type used within a program to encode characters.

## Remarks

As with any locale facet, the static object ID has an initial stored value of zero. The first attempt to access its stored value stores a unique positive value in `id`. Classification criteria are provided a nested bitmask type in the base class ctype_base.

The C++ Standard Library defines two explicit specializations of this template class:

- [ctype](../standard-library/ctype-char-class.md)< `char`>, an explicit specialization whose differences are described separately.

- **ctype**<`wchar_t`>, which treats elements as wide characters.

Other specializations of template class **ctype**\< **CharType**>:

- Convert a value ***ch*** of type `CharType` to a value of type **char** with the expression (`char`) **ch**.

- Convert a value ***byte*** of type **char** to a value of type `CharType` with the expression **CharType** (**byte**).

All other operations are performed on **char** values in the same way as for the explicit specialization **ctype**<`char`>.

### Constructors

## Requirements

**Header:** \<locale>

**Namespace:** std

## <a name="char_type"></a>  ctype::char_type

A type that describes a character used by a locale.

```cpp
typedef CharType char_type;
```

### Remarks

The type is a synonym for the template parameter *CharType*.

### Example

See the member function [widen](#widen) for an example that uses `char_type` as a return value.

## <a name="ctype"></a>  ctype::ctype

Constructor for objects of class ctype that serve as locale facets for characters.

```cpp
explicit ctype(size_t _Refs = 0);
```

### Parameters

*_Refs*
 Integer value used to specify the type of memory management for the object.

### Remarks

The possible values for the *_Refs* parameter and their significance are:

- 0: The lifetime of the object is managed by the locales that contain it.

- 1: The lifetime of the object must be manually managed.

- \> 1: These values are not defined.

No direct examples are possible, because the destructor is protected.

The constructor initializes its `locale::facet` base object with **locale::**[facet](../standard-library/locale-class.md#facet_class)( `_Refs`).

## <a name="do_is"></a>  ctype::do_is

A virtual function called to test whether a single character has a particular attribute, or classify the attributes of each character in a range and stores them in an array.

```cpp
virtual bool do_is(
    mask maskVal,
    CharType ch) const;


virtual const CharType *do_is(
    const CharType* first,
    const CharType* last,
    mask* dest) const;
```

### Parameters

*maskVal*
 The mask value for which the character is to be tested.

*ch*
 The character whose attributes are to be tested.

*first*
 A pointer to the first character in the range whose attributes are to be classified.

*last*
 A pointer to the character immediately following the last character in the range whose attributes are to be classified.

*dest*
 A pointer to the beginning of the array where the mask values characterizing the attributes of each of the characters are to be stored.

### Return Value

The first member function returns a Boolean value that is **true** if the character tested has the attribute described by the mask value; **false** if it fails to have the attribute.

The second member function returns an array containing the mask values characterizing the attributes of each of the characters in the range.

### Remarks

The mask values classifying the attributes of the characters are provided by the class [ctype_base](../standard-library/ctype-base-class.md), from which ctype derives. The first member function can accept expressions for its first parameter referred to as bitmasks and formed from the combination of mask values by the logical bitwise operators (&#124; , & , ^ , ~).

### Example

See the example for [is](#is), which calls `do_is`.

## <a name="do_narrow"></a>  ctype::do_narrow

A virtual function called to convert a character of type `CharType` used by a locale to the corresponding character of type **char** in the native character set.

```cpp
virtual char do_narrow(
    CharType ch,
    char default = '\0') const;


virtual const CharType* do_narrow(
    const CharType* first,
    const CharType* last,
    char default,
    char* dest) const;
```

### Parameters

*ch*
 The character of type `Chartype` used by the locale to be converted.

*default*
 The default value to be assigned by the member function to characters of type `CharType` that do not have counterpart characters of type **char**.

*first*
 A pointer to the first character in the range of characters to be converted.

*last*
 A pointer to the character immediately following the last character in the range of characters to be converted.

*dest*
 A const pointer to the first character of type **char** in the destination range that stores the converted range of characters.

### Return Value

The first protected member function returns the native character of type char that corresponds to the parameter character of type `CharType` or *default* if no counterpart is defined.

The second protected member function returns a pointer to the destination range of native characters converted from characters of type `CharType`.

### Remarks

The second protected member template function stores in `dest`[ `I`] the value `do_narrow`( `first` [ `I`], `default`), for `I` in the interval [0, `last` - `first`).

### Example

See the example for [narrow](#narrow), which calls `do_narrow`.

## <a name="do_scan_is"></a>  ctype::do_scan_is

A virtual function called to locate the first character in a range that matches a specified mask.

```cpp
virtual const CharType *do_scan_is(

    const CharType* last,
    mask* dest) const;
```

### Parameters

*maskVal*
 The mask value for which the character is to be tested.

*ch*
 The character whose attributes are to be tested.

*first*
 A pointer to the first character in the range whose attributes are to be classified.

*last*
 A pointer to the character immediately following the last character in the range whose attributes are to be classified.

*dest*
 A pointer to the beginning of the array where the mask values characterizing the attributes of each of the characters are to be stored.

### Return Value

The first member function returns **true** if the character tested has the attribute described by the mask value; **false** if it fails to have the attribute.

The second member function returns a pointer to the last character in the range whose attributes are to be classified.

### Remarks

The mask values classifying the attributes of the characters are provided by the class [ctype_base Class](../standard-library/ctype-base-class.md), from which ctype derives. The first member function can accept expressions for its first parameter referred to as bitmasks and formed from the combination of mask values by the logical bitwise operators (&#124; , & , ^ , ~).

### Example

```cpp
// ctype_is.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <locale>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   locale loc1 ( "German_Germany" ), loc2 ( "English_Australia" );

   if (use_facet<ctype<char> > ( loc1 ).is( ctype_base::alpha, 'a' ))
      cout << "The character 'a' in locale loc1 is alphabetic."
           << endl;
   else
      cout << "The character 'a' in locale loc1 is not alphabetic."
           << endl;

   if (use_facet<ctype<char> > ( loc2 ).is( ctype_base::alpha, '!' ))
      cout << "The character '!' in locale loc2 is alphabetic."
           << endl;
   else
      cout << "The character '!' in locale loc2 is not alphabetic."
           << endl;

   char *string = "Hello, my name is John!";
   ctype<char>::mask maskarray[30];
   use_facet<ctype<char> > ( loc2 ).is(
      string, string + strlen(string), maskarray );
   for (unsigned int i = 0; i < strlen(string); i++) {
      cout << string[i] << ": "
           << (maskarray[i] & ctype_base::alpha  "alpha"
                                                : "not alpha")
           << endl;;
   };
}
```

## <a name="narrow"></a>  ctype::narrow

Converts characters of type `CharType` used by a locale to the corresponding characters of type **char** in the native character set.

```cpp
char narrow(CharType ch, char default = '\0') const;


const CharType* narrow(
    const CharType* first,
    const CharType* last,

    char* dest) const;
```

### Parameters

*ch*
 The character of type `Chartype` used by the locale to be converted.

*default*
 The default value to be assigned by the member function to characters of type `CharType` that do not have counterpart characters of type **char**.

*first*
 A pointer to the first character in the range of characters to be converted.

*last*
 A pointer to the character immediately following the last character in the range of characters to be converted.

*dest*
 A const pointer to the first character of type **char** in the destination range that stores the converted range of characters.

### Return Value

The first member function returns the native character of type **char** that corresponds to the parameter character of type `CharType default` if not counterpart is defined.

The second member function returns a pointer to the destination range of native characters converted from characters of type `CharType`.

### Remarks

The first member function returns [do_narrow](#do_narrow)(`ch`, `default`). The second member function returns [do_narrow](#do_narrow) (`first`, `last`, `default`, `dest`). Only the basic source characters are guaranteed to have a unique inverse image `CharType` under `narrow`. For these basic source characters, the following invariant holds: `narrow` ( [widen](#widen) ( **c** ), 0 ) == **c**.

### Example

```cpp
// ctype_narrow.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc /W3
#include <locale>
#include <iostream>
