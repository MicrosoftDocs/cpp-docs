# &lt;fstream&gt;

Defines several classes that support iostreams operations on sequences stored in external files.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <fstream>

```

### Typedefs

|Type name|Description|
|-|-|
|[filebuf](../standard-library/fstream-typedefs.md#filebuf)|A type `basic_filebuf` specialized on **char** template parameters.|
|[fstream](../standard-library/fstream-typedefs.md#fstream)|A type `basic_fstream` specialized on **char** template parameters.|
|[ifstream](../standard-library/fstream-typedefs.md#ifstream)|A type `basic_ifstream` specialized on **char** template parameters.|
|[ofstream](../standard-library/fstream-typedefs.md#ofstream)|A type `basic_ofstream` specialized on **char** template parameters.|
|[wfstream](../standard-library/fstream-typedefs.md#wfstream)|A type `basic_fstream` specialized on **wchar_t** template parameters.|
|[wifstream](../standard-library/fstream-typedefs.md#wifstream)|A type `basic_ifstream` specialized on **wchar_t** template parameters.|
|[wofstream](../standard-library/fstream-typedefs.md#wofstream)|A type `basic_ofstream` specialized on **wchar_t** template parameters.|
|[wfilebuf](../standard-library/fstream-typedefs.md#wfilebuf)|A type `basic_filebuf` specialized on **wchar_t** template parameters.|

### Classes

|Class|Description|
|-|-|
|[basic_filebuf](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md)|The template class describes a stream buffer that controls the transmission of elements of type `Elem`, whose character traits are determined by the class `Tr`, to and from a sequence of elements stored in an external file.|
|[basic_fstream](../standard-library/basic-fstream-class.md)|The template class describes an object that controls insertion and extraction of elements and encoded objects using a stream buffer of class [basic_filebuf](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md)\<**Elem**, **Tr**>, with elements of type `Elem`, whose character traits are determined by the class `Tr`.|
|[basic_ifstream](../standard-library/basic-ifstream-class.md)|The template class describes an object that controls extraction of elements and encoded objects from a stream buffer of class [basic_filebuf](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md)\<**Elem**, **Tr**>, with elements of type `Elem`, whose character traits are determined by the class `Tr`.|
|[basic_ofstream](../standard-library/basic-ofstream-class.md)|The template class describes an object that controls insertion of elements and encoded objects into a stream buffer of class [basic_filebuf](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md)\<**Elem**, **Tr**>, with elements of type `Elem`, whose character traits are determined by the class `Tr`.|
