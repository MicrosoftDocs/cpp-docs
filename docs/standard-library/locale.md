# &lt;locale&gt;

Defines template classes and functions that C++ programs can use to encapsulate and manipulate different cultural conventions regarding the representation and formatting of numeric, monetary, and calendric data, including internationalization support for character classification and string collation.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <locale>

```

### Classes

|Class|Description|
|-|-|
|[codecvt](../standard-library/codecvt-class.md)|A template class that provides a facet used to convert between internal and external character encodings.|
|[codecvt_base](../standard-library/codecvt-base-class.md)|A base class for the codecvt class that is used to define an enumeration type referred to as `result`, used as the return type for the facet member functions to indicate the result of a conversion.|
|[codecvt_byname](../standard-library/codecvt-byname-class.md)|A derived template class that describes an object that can serve as a collate facet of a given locale, enabling the retrieval of information specific to a cultural area concerning conversions.|
|[collate](../standard-library/collate-class.md)|A collate template class that provides a facet that handles string sorting conventions.|
|[collate_byname](../standard-library/collate-byname-class.md)|A derived template class that describes an object that can serve as a collate facet of a given locale, enabling the retrieval of information specific to a cultural area concerning string sorting conventions.|
|[ctype](../standard-library/ctype-class.md)|A template class that provides a facet that is used to classify characters, convert from upper- and lowercase and between the native character set and that set used by the locale.|
|[ctype\<char>](../standard-library/ctype-char-class.md)|A class that is an explicit specialization of template class `ctype<CharType>` to type **char**, describing an object that can serve as a locale facet to characterize various properties of a character of type **char**.|
|[ctype_base](../standard-library/ctype-base-class.md)|A base class for the ctype class that is used to define enumeration types used to classify or test characters either individually or within entire ranges.|
|[ctype_byname](../standard-library/ctype-byname-class.md)|A derived template class that describes an object that can serve as a ctype facet of a given locale, enabling the classification of characters and conversion of characters between case and native and locale specified character sets.|
|[locale](../standard-library/locale-class.md)|A class that describes a locale object that encapsulates culture-specific information as a set of facets that collectively define a specific localized environment.|
|[messages](../standard-library/messages-class.md)|A template class that describes an object that can serve as a locale facet to retrieve localized messages from a catalog of internationalized messages for a given locale.|
|[messages_base](../standard-library/messages-base-class.md)|A base class that describes an **int** type for the catalog of messages.|
|[messages_byname](../standard-library/messages-byname-class.md)|A derived template class that describes an object that can serve as a message facet of a given locale, enabling the retrieval of localized messages.|
|[money_base](../standard-library/money-base-class.md)|A base class for the ctype class that is used to define enumeration types used to classify or test characters either individually or within entire ranges.|
|[money_get](../standard-library/money-get-class.md)|A template class that describes an object that can serve as a locale facet to control conversions of sequences of type **CharType** to monetary values.|
|[money_put](../standard-library/money-put-class.md)|A template class that describes an object that can serve as a locale facet to control conversions of monetary values to sequences of type **CharType**.|
|[moneypunct](../standard-library/moneypunct-class.md)|A template class that describes an object that can serve as a locale facet to describe the sequences of type **CharType** used to represent a monetary input field or a monetary output field.|
|[moneypunct_byname](../standard-library/moneypunct-byname-class.md)|A derived template class that describes an object that can serve as a moneypunct facet of a given locale enabling the formatting monetary input or output fields.|
|[num_get](../standard-library/num-get-class.md)|A template class that describes an object that can serve as a locale facet to control conversions of sequences of type **CharType** to numeric values.|
|[num_put](../standard-library/num-put-class.md)|A template class that describes an object that can serve as a locale facet to control conversions of numeric values to sequences of type **CharType**.|
|[numpunct](../standard-library/numpunct-class.md)|A template class that describes an object that can serve as a local facet to describe the sequences of type **CharType** used to represent information about the formatting and punctuation of numeric and Boolean expressions.|
