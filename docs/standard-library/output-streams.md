# Output Streams

An output stream object is a destination for bytes. The three most important output stream classes are `ostream`, `ofstream`, and `ostringstream`.

The `ostream` class, through the derived class `basic_ostream`, supports the predefined stream objects:

- `cout` standard output

- `cerr` standard error with limited buffering

- `clog` similar to `cerr` but with full buffering

Objects are rarely constructed from `ostream`; predefined objects are generally used. In some cases, you can reassign predefined objects after program startup. The `ostream` class, which can be configured for buffered or unbuffered operation, is best suited to sequential text-mode output. All functionality of the base class, `ios`, is included in `ostream`. If you construct an object of class `ostream`, you must specify a `streambuf` object to the constructor.

The `ofstream` class supports disk file output. If you need an output-only disk, construct an object of class `ofstream`. You can specify whether `ofstream` objects accept binary or text-mode data when constructing the `ofstream` object or when calling the `open` member function of the object. Many formatting options and member functions apply to `ofstream` objects, and all functionality of the base classes `ios` and `ostream` is included.

If you specify a filename in the constructor, that file is automatically opened when the object is constructed. Otherwise, you can use the `open` member function after invoking the default constructor.

Like the run-time function `sprintf_s`, the `ostringstream` class supports output to in-memory strings. To create a string in memory by using I/O stream formatting, construct an object of class `ostringstream`.
