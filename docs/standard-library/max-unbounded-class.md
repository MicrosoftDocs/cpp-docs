# max_unbounded Class

Describes a [max class](../standard-library/allocators-header.md) object that does not limit the maximum length of a [freelist](../standard-library/freelist-class.md) object.

## Syntax

```cpp
class max_unbounded
```

### Member functions

|Member function|Description|
|-|-|
|[allocated](#allocated)|Increments the count of allocated memory blocks.|
|[deallocated](#deallocated)|Decrements the count of allocated memory blocks.|
|[full](#full)|Returns a value that specifies whether more memory blocks should be added to the free list.|
|[released](#released)|Decrements the count of memory blocks on the free list.|
|[saved](#saved)|Increments the count of memory blocks on the free list.|

## Requirements

**Header:** \<allocators>

**Namespace:** stdext

## <a name="allocated"></a>  max_unbounded::allocated

Increments the count of allocated memory blocks.

```cpp
void allocated(std::size_t _Nx = 1);
```

### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|*_Nx*|The increment value.|

### Remarks

This member function does nothing. It is called after each successful call by `cache_freelist::allocate` to operator **new**. The argument *_Nx* is the number of memory blocks in the chunk allocated by operator **new**.

## <a name="deallocated"></a>  max_unbounded::deallocated

Decrements the count of allocated memory blocks.

```cpp
void deallocated(std::size_t _Nx = 1);
```

### Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|*_Nx*|The increment value.|

### Remarks

The member function does nothing. This member function is called after each call by `cache_freelist::deallocate` to operator **delete**. The argument *_Nx* is the number of memory blocks in the chunk deallocated by operator **delete**.

## <a name="full"></a>  max_unbounded::full

Returns a value that specifies whether more memory blocks should be added to the free list.

```cpp
bool full();
```

### Return Value

The member function always returns **false**.

### Remarks

This member function is called by `cache_freelist::deallocate`. If the call returns **true**, `deallocate` puts the memory block on the free list; if it returns false, `deallocate` calls operator **delete** to deallocate the block.

## <a name="released"></a>  max_unbounded::released

Decrements the count of memory blocks on the free list.

```cpp
void released();
```

### Remarks

This member function does nothing. The `released` member function of the current max class is called by `cache_freelist::allocate` whenever it removes a memory block from the free list.

## <a name="saved"></a>  max_unbounded::saved

Increments the count of memory blocks on the free list.

```cpp
void saved();
```

### Remarks

This member function does nothing. It is called by `cache_freelist::deallocate` whenever it puts a memory block on the free list.
