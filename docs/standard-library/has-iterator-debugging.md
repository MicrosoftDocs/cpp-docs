# _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING

Superseded by [_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL](../standard-library/iterator-debug-level.md), this macro defines whether the iterator debugging feature is enabled in a debug build. By default, iterator debugging is enabled in Debug builds and disabled in Retail builds. For more information, see [Debug Iterator Support](../standard-library/debug-iterator-support.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Direct use of the _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING macro is deprecated. Instead, use _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL to control iterator debug settings. For more information, see [_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL](../standard-library/iterator-debug-level.md).

## Remarks

To enable iterator debugging in debug builds, set _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL to 2. This is equivalent to a _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING setting of 1, or enabled:

```cpp
#define _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL 2
```

_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL cannot be set to 2 (and _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING cannot be set to 1) in retail builds.

To disable debug iterators in debug builds, set _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL to 0 or 1. This is equivalent to a _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING setting of 0, or disabled:

```cpp
#define _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL 0
```
