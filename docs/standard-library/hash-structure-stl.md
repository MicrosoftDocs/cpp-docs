# hash Structure (C++ Standard Library)

Defines a member function that returns a value that's uniquely determined by `Val`. The member function defines a [hash](../standard-library/hash-class.md) function that's suitable for mapping values of type `thread::id` to a distribution of index values.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <>
struct hash<thread::id> :
    public unary_function<thread::id, size_t>
{
    size_t operator()(thread::id Val) const;

};
```

## Requirements

**Header:** \<thread>

**Namespace:** std
