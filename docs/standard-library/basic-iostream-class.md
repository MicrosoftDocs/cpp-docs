# basic_iostream Class

A stream class that can do both input and output.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class Elem, class Tr = char_traits<Elem>>
class basic_iostream : public basic_istream<Elem, Tr>,
    public basic_ostream<Elem, Tr>
{
public:
    explicit basic_iostream(basic_streambuf<Elem, Tr>* strbuf);

    virtual ~basic_iostream();

};
```

## Remarks

The template class describes an object that controls insertions, through its base class [basic_ostream](../standard-library/basic-ostream-class.md)< `Elem`, `Tr`>, and extractions, through its base class [basic_istream](../standard-library/basic-istream-class.md)< `Elem`, `Tr`>. The two objects share a common virtual base class [basic_ios](../standard-library/basic-ios-class.md)< `Elem`, `Tr`>. They also manage a common stream buffer, with elements of type `Elem`, whose character traits are determined by the class `Tr`. The constructor initializes its base classes through `basic_istream`( **strbuf**) and `basic_ostream`( **strbuf**).

### Constructors

|Constructor|Description|
|-|-|
|[basic_iostream](#basic_iostream)|Create a `basic_iostream` object.|

### Member functions

|Member function|Description|
|-|-|
|[swap](#swap)|Exchanges the contents of the provided `basic_iostream` object for the contents of this object.|

### Operators

|Operator|Description|
|-|-|
|[operator=](#op_eq)|Assigns the value of a specified `basic_iostream` object to this object. This is a move assignment involving an `rvalue` that does not leave a copy behind.|

## Requirements

**Header:** \<istream>

**Namespace:** std

## <a name="basic_iostream"></a>  basic_iostream::basic_iostream

Create a `basic_iostream` object.

```cpp
explicit basic_iostream(basic_streambuf<Elem, Tr>* strbuf);

basic_iostream(basic_iostream&& right);

basic_iostream();
```

### Parameters

*strbuf*
 An existing `basic_streambuf` object.

*right*
 An existing `basic_iostream` object that is used to construct a new `basic_iostream`.

### Remarks

The first constructor initializes the base objects by way of `basic_istream(strbuf)` and `basic_ostream(strbuf)`.

The second constructor initializes the base objects by calling `move(right)`.

## <a name="op_eq"></a>  basic_iostream::operator=

Assign the value of a specified `basic_iostream` object to this object. This is a move assignment involving an rvalue that does not leave a copy behind.

```cpp
basic_iostream& operator=(basic_iostream&& right);
```

### Parameters

*right*
 An `rvalue` reference to a `basic_iostream` object to assign from.

### Remarks

The member operator calls `swap(right)`.

## <a name="swap"></a>  basic_iostream::swap

Exchanges the contents of the provided `basic_iostream` object for the contents of this object.

```cpp
void swap(basic_iostream& right);
```

### Parameters

*right*
 The `basic_iostream` object to swap.

### Remarks

The member function calls `swap(right)`.
