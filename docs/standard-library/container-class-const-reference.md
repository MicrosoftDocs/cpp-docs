> [!NOTE]
> This topic is in the Microsoft C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the C++ Standard Library. For more information, see [C++ Standard Library Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).

Describes an object that can serve as a constant reference to an element of the controlled sequence.

```
