# &lt;limits&gt;

Defines the template class `numeric_limits` and two enumerations concerning floating-point representations and rounding.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <limits>

```

## Remarks

Explicit specializations of the `numeric_limits` class describe many properties of the fundamental types, including the character, integer, and floating-point types and **bool** that are implementation defined rather than fixed by the rules of the C++ language. Properties described in \<limits> include accuracy, minimum and maximum sized representations, rounding, and signaling type errors.

### Enumerations

|||
|-|-|
|[float_denorm_style](../standard-library/limits-enums.md#float_denorm_style)|The enumeration describes the various methods that an implementation can choose for representing a denormalized floating-point value â€” one too small to represent as a normalized value:|
|[float_round_style](../standard-library/limits-enums.md#float_round_style)|The enumeration describes the various methods that an implementation can choose for rounding a floating-point value to an integer value.|

### Classes

|Class|Description|
|-|-|
|[numeric_limits Class](../standard-library/numeric-limits-class.md)|The template class describes arithmetic properties of built-in numerical types.|
