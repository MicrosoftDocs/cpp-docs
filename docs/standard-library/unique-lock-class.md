# unique_lock Class

Represents a template that can be instantiated to create objects that manage the locking and unlocking of a `mutex`.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class Mutex>
class unique_lock;
```

## Remarks

The template argument `Mutex` must name a *mutex type*.

Internally, a `unique_lock` stores a pointer to an associated `mutex` object and a **bool** that indicates whether the current thread owns the `mutex`.

## Members

## Inheritance Hierarchy

*unique_lock*<br/>

## Requirements

**Header:** \<mutex>

**Namespace:** std

## <a name="lock"></a>  lock

Blocks the calling thread until the thread obtains ownership of the associated `mutex`.

```cpp
void lock();
```

### Remarks

If the stored `mutex` pointer is NULL, this method throws a [system_error](../standard-library/system-error-class.md) that has an error code of `operation_not_permitted`.

If the calling thread already owns the associated `mutex`, this method throws a `system_error` that has an error code of `resource_deadlock_would_occur`.

Otherwise, this method calls `lock` on the associated `mutex` and sets the internal thread ownership flag to **true**.

## <a name="mutex"></a>  mutex

Retrieves the stored pointer to the associated `mutex`.

```cpp
mutex_type *mutex() const noexcept;
```

## <a name="op_bool"></a>  operator bool

Specifies whether the calling thread has ownership of the associated mutex.

```cpp
explicit operator bool() noexcept
```

### Return Value

**true** if the thread owns the mutex; otherwise **false**.

## <a name="op_eq"></a>  operator=

Copies the stored `mutex` pointer and associated ownership status from a specified object.

```cpp
unique_lock& operator=(unique_lock&& Other) noexcept;
```

### Parameters

*Other*  
A `unique_lock` object.

### Return Value

`*this`

### Remarks

If the calling thread owns the previously associated `mutex`, before this method calls `unlock` on the `mutex`, it assigns the new values.

After the copy, this method sets *Other* to a default-constructed state.

## <a name="owns_lock"></a>  owns_lock

Specifies whether the calling thread owns the associated `mutex`.

```cpp
bool owns_lock() const noexcept;
```

### Return Value

**true** if the thread owns the `mutex`; otherwise, **false**.

## <a name="release"></a>  release

Disassociates the `unique_lock` object from the associated `mutex` object.

```cpp
mutex_type *release() noexcept;
```

### Return Value

The previous value of the stored `mutex` pointer.

### Remarks

This method sets the value of the stored `mutex` pointer to 0 and sets the internal `mutex` ownership flag to **false**.

## <a name="swap"></a>  swap

Swaps the associated `mutex` and ownership status with that of a specified object.

```cpp
void swap(unique_lock& Other) noexcept;
```

### Parameters

*Other*  
A `unique_lock` object.

## <a name="try_lock"></a>  try_lock

Attempts to obtain ownership of the associated `mutex` without blocking.

```cpp
bool try_lock() noexcept;
```

### Return Value

**true** if the method successfully obtains ownership of the `mutex`; otherwise, **false**.

### Remarks

If the stored `mutex` pointer is NULL, the method throws a [system_error](../standard-library/system-error-class.md) that has an error code of `operation_not_permitted`.

If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the method throws a `system_error` that has an error code of `resource_deadlock_would_occur`.

## <a name="try_lock_for"></a>  try_lock_for

Attempts to obtain ownership of the associated `mutex` without blocking.

```cpp
template <class Rep, class Period>
bool try_lock_for(
    const chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& Rel_time);
```

### Parameters

*Rel_time*  
A [chrono::duration](../standard-library/duration-class.md) object that specifies the maximum amount of time that the method attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex`.

### Return Value

**true** if the method successfully obtains ownership of the `mutex`; otherwise, **false**.

### Remarks

If the stored `mutex` pointer is NULL, the method throws a [system_error](../standard-library/system-error-class.md) that has an error code of `operation_not_permitted`.

If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the method throws a `system_error` that has an error code of `resource_deadlock_would_occur`.

## <a name="try_lock_until"></a>  try_lock_until

Attempts to obtain ownership of the associated `mutex` without blocking.

```cpp
template <class Clock, class Duration>
bool try_lock_until(const chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>& Abs_time);

bool try_lock_until(const xtime* Abs_time);
```

### Parameters

*Abs_time*  
A point in time that specifies the threshold after which the method no longer attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex`.

### Return Value

**true** if the method successfully obtains ownership of the `mutex`; otherwise, **false**.

### Remarks

If the stored `mutex` pointer is NULL, the method throws a [system_error](../standard-library/system-error-class.md) that has an error code of `operation_not_permitted`.

If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the method throws a `system_error` that has an error code of `resource_deadlock_would_occur`.

## <a name="unique_lock"></a>  unique_lock Constructor

Constructs a `unique_lock` object.

```cpp
unique_lock() noexcept;
unique_lock(unique_lock&& Other) noexcept;
explicit unique_lock(mutex_type& Mtx);

unique_lock(mutex_type& Mtx, adopt_lock_t Adopt);

unique_lock(mutex_type& Mtx, defer_lock_t Defer) noexcept;
unique_lock(mutex_type& Mtx, try_to_lock_t Try);

template <class Rep, class Period>
unique_lock(mutex_type& Mtx,
    const chrono::duration<Rep, Period>
Rel_time);

template <class Clock, class Duration>
unique_lock(mutex_type& Mtx,
    const chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>
Abs_time);

unique_lock(mutex_type& Mtx,
    const xtime* Abs_time) noexcept;
```

### Parameters

*Mtx*  
A mutex type object.

*Rel_time*  
A [chrono::duration](../standard-library/duration-class.md) object that specifies the maximum amount of time that the method attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex`.

*Abs_time*  
A point in time that specifies the threshold after which the method no longer attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex`.

*Other*  
A `unique_lock` object.

### Remarks

The first constructor constructs an object that has an associated mutex pointer value of 0.

The second constructor moves the associated mutex status from *Other*. After the move, *Other* is no longer associated with a mutex.

The remaining constructors store & *Mtx* as the stored `mutex` pointer. Ownership of the `mutex` is determined by the second argument, if it exists.

|||
|-|-|
|`No argument`|Ownership is obtained by calling the `lock` method on the associated `mutex` object.|
|`Adopt`|Ownership is assumed. `Mtx` must be locked when the constructor is called.|
|`Defer`|The calling thread is assumed not to own the `mutex` object. `Mtx` must not be locked when the constructor is called.|
|`Try`|Ownership is determined by calling `try_lock` on the associated `mutex` object. The constructor throws nothing.|
|`Rel_time`|Ownership is determined by calling `try_lock_for(Rel_time)`.|
|`Abs_time`|Ownership is determined by calling `try_lock_until(Abs_time)`.|

## <a name="dtorunique_lock_destructor"></a>  ~unique_lock Destructor

Releases any resources that are associated with the `unique_lock` object.

```cpp
~unique_lock() noexcept;
```

### Remarks

If the calling thread owns the associated `mutex`, the destructor releases ownership by calling unlock on the `mutex` object.

## <a name="unlock"></a>  unlock

Releases ownership of the associated `mutex`.

```cpp
void unlock();
```

### Remarks

If the calling thread doesn't own the associated `mutex`, this method throws a [system_error](../standard-library/system-error-class.md) that has an error code of `operation_not_permitted`.

Otherwise, this method calls `unlock` on the associated `mutex` and sets the internal thread ownership flag to **false**.
