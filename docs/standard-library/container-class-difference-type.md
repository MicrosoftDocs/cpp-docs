# Container Class::difference_type
> [!NOTE]
>  This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the Standard C++ Library. For more information, see [STL Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).  
  
 Describes an object that can represent the difference between the addresses of any two elements in the controlled sequence.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
 
typedef T1 difference_type;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type **T1** (typically **Alloc::difference_type**).
