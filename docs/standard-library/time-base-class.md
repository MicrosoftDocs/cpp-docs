# time_base Class

The class serves as a base class for facets of template class time_get, defining just the enumerated type `dateorder` and several constants of this type.

## Syntax

```cpp
class time_base : public locale::facet {
public:
    enum dateorder {no_order,
    dmy,
 mdy,
    ymd,
 ydm};
    time_base(
 size_t _Refs = 0)
 ~time_base();

};
```

## Remarks

Each constant characterizes a different way to order the components of a date. The constants are:

- `no_order` specifies no particular order.

- `dmy` specifies the order day, month, then year, as in 2 December 1979.

- `mdy` specifies the order month, day, then year, as in December 2, 1979.

- `ymd` specifies the order year, month, then day, as in 1979/12/2.

- `ydm` specifies the order year, day, then month, as in 1979: 2 Dec.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<locale>

**Namespace:** std
