# ctype_byname Class

The derived class template describes an object that can serve as a ctype facet of a given locale, enabling the classification of characters and conversion of characters between case and native and locale specified character sets.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class _Elem>
class ctype_byname : public ctype<_Elem>
{
public:
    explicit ctype_byname(
    const char* _Locname,
    size_t _Refs = 0);

    explicit ctype_byname(
    const string& _Locname,
    size_t _Refs = 0);

protected:
    virtual __CLR_OR_THIS_CALL ~ctype_byname();

};
```

## Remarks

Its behavior is determined by the named locale `_Locname`. Each constructor initializes its base object with [ctype](../standard-library/ctype-class.md)\<CharType>(`_Refs`) or the equivalent for base class `ctype<char>`.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<locale>

**Namespace:** std
