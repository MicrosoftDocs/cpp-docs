# &lt;streambuf&gt;

Include the iostreams standard header \<streambuf> to define the template class [basic_streambuf](../standard-library/basic-streambuf-class.md), which is basic to the operation of the iostreams classes. This header is typically included for you by another of the iostreams headers; you rarely need to include it directly.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <streambuf>

```

### Typedefs

|Type name|Description|
|-|-|
|[streambuf](../standard-library/streambuf-typedefs.md#streambuf)|A specialization of `basic_streambuf` that uses **char** as the template parameters.|
|[wstreambuf](../standard-library/streambuf-typedefs.md#wstreambuf)|A specialization of `basic_streambuf` that uses **wchar_t** as the template parameters.|

### Classes

|Class|Description|
|-|-|
|[basic_streambuf Class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d9c706ba-ce01-43e0-b0b2-a558fc53ea8d)|The template class describes an abstract base class for deriving a stream buffer, which controls the transmission of elements to and from a specific representation of a stream.|
