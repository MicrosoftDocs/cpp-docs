# &lt;codecvt&gt;

Defines several template classes that describe objects based on template class [codecvt](../standard-library/codecvt-class.md). These objects can serve as [locale facets](../standard-library/locale-class.md#facet_class) that control conversions between a sequence of values of type `Elem` and a sequence of values of type **char**.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <codecvt>

```

## Remarks

The locale facets declared in this header convert between several character encodings. For wide characters (stored within the program in fixed-size integers):

- UCS-4 is Unicode (ISO 10646) encoded within the program as a 32-bit integer.

- UCS-2 is Unicode encoded within the program as a 16-bit integer.

- UTF-16 is Unicode encoded within the program as either one or two 16-bit integers. (Note that this does not meet all the requirements of a valid wide-character encoding for Standard C or Standard C++. Nevertheless it is widely used as such.)

For byte streams (stored in a file, transmitted as a byte sequence, or stored within the program in an array of **char**):

- UTF-8 is Unicode encoded within a byte stream as one or more eight-bit bytes with a deterministic byte order.

- UTF-16LE is Unicode encoded within a byte stream as UTF-16 with each 16-bit integer presented as two eight-bit bytes, less significant byte first.

- UTF-16BE is Unicode encoded within a byte stream as UTF-16 with each 16-bit integer presented as two eight-bit bytes, more significant byte first.

### Enumerations
