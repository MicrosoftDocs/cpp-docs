# collate_byname Class

A derived class template that describes an object that can serve as a collate facet of a given locale, enabling the retrieval of information specific to a cultural area concerning string sorting conventions.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class CharType>
class collate_byname : public collate<CharType> {
public:
    explicit collate_byname(
    const char* _Locname,
    size_t _Refs = 0);

    explicit collate_byname(
    const string& _Locname,
    size_t _Refs = 0);

protected:
    virtual ~collate_byname();

};
```

### Parameters

*_Locname*\
A named locale.

*_Refs*\
An initial reference count.

## Remarks

The class template describes an object that can serve as a [locale facet](../standard-library/locale-class.md#facet_class) of type [collate](../standard-library/collate-class.md#collate)\<CharType>. Its behavior is determined by the [named](../standard-library/locale-class.md#name) locale *_Locname*. Each constructor initializes its base object with [collate](../standard-library/collate-class.md#collate)\<CharType>(`_Refs`).

## Requirements

**Header:** \<locale>

**Namespace:** std
