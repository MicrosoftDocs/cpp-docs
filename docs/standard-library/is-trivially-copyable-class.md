# is_trivially_copyable Class

Tests whether the type is a trivially copyable type.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class T>
struct is_trivially_copyable;
```

### Parameters

*T*
 The type to query.

## Remarks

An instance of the type predicate holds true if the type *T* is a trivially copyable type, otherwise it holds false. Trivially copyable types have no non-trivial copy operations, move operations, or destructors. Generally, a copy operation is considered trivial if it can be implemented as a bitwise copy. Both built-in types and arrays of trivially copyable types are trivially copyable.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<type_traits>

**Namespace:** std
