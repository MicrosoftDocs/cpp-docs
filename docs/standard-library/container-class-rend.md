# Container Class::rend

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the C++ Standard Library. For more information, see [C++ Standard Library Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).

The member function returns a reverse iterator that points at the first element of the sequence (or just beyond the end of an empty sequence), designating the end of the reverse sequence.

## Syntax

```

    const_reverse_iterator rend() const;


reverse_iterator rend();
```
