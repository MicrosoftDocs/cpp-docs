# complex&lt;double&gt;

Describes an object that stores an ordered pair of objects both of type **double***,* the first representing the real part of a complex number and the second representing the imaginary part.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <>
class complex<double> {
public:
    constexpr complex(
    double RealVal = 0,
    double ImagVal = 0);

constexpr complex(const complex<double>& complexNum);

constexpr explicit complex(const complex<long double>& complexNum);
// rest same as template class complex
};
```

### Parameters

*RealVal*
 The value of type **double** for the real part of the complex number being constructed.

*ImagVal*
 The value of type **double** for the imaginary part of the complex number being constructed.

*complexNum*
 The complex number of type **float** or of type **long double** whose real and imaginary parts are used to initialize a complex number of type **double** being constructed.

## Return Value

A complex number of type **double**.

## Remarks

The explicit specialization of the template class complex to a complex class of type **double** differs from the template class only in the constructors it defines. The conversion from **float** to **double** is allowed to be implicit, but the conversion from **long double** to **double** is required to be **explicit**. The use of **explicit** rules out the initiation with type conversion using assignment syntax.

For more information on the template class `complex`, see [complex Class](../standard-library/complex-class.md). For a list of members of the template class `complex`, see .

## Example

```cpp
// complex_comp_dbl.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   double pi = 3.14159265359;

   // The first constructor specifies real & imaginary parts
   complex <double> c1 ( 4.0 , 5.0 );
   cout << "Specifying initial real & imaginary parts,\n"
        << " as type double gives c1 = " << c1 << endl;

   // The second constructor initializes values of the real &
   // imaginary parts using those of complex number of type float
   complex <float> c2float ( 4.0 , 5.0 );
   complex <double> c2double ( c2float );
   cout << "Implicit conversion from type float to type double,"
        << "\n gives c2double = " << c2double << endl;

   // The third constructor initializes values of the real &
   // imaginary parts using those of a complex number
   // of type long double
   complex <long double> c3longdouble ( 4.0 , 5.0 );
   complex <double> c3double ( c3longdouble );
   cout << "Explicit conversion from type float to type double,"
        << "\n gives c3longdouble = " << c3longdouble << endl;

   // The modulus and argument of a complex number can be recovered
   double absc3 = abs ( c3longdouble );
   double argc3 = arg ( c3longdouble );
   cout << "The modulus of c3 is recovered from c3 using: abs ( c3 ) = "
        << absc3 << endl;
   cout << "Argument of c3 is recovered from c3 using:\n arg ( c3 ) = "
        << argc3 << " radians, which is " << argc3 * 180 / pi
        << " degrees." << endl;
}
\* Output:
Specifying initial real & imaginary parts,
 as type double gives c1 = (4,5)
Implicit conversion from type float to type double,
 gives c2double = (4,5)
Explicit conversion from type float to type double,
 gives c3longdouble = (4,5)
The modulus of c3 is recovered from c3 using: abs ( c3 ) = 6.40312
Argument of c3 is recovered from c3 using:
 arg ( c3 ) = 0.896055 radians, which is 51.3402 degrees.
