## <a name="op_neq"></a>  operator!= (set)

Tests if the set object on the left side of the operator is not equal to the set object on the right side.

```cpp
bool operator!=(const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& left, const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& right);
```

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
An object of type `set`.

*right*<br/>
An object of type `set`.

### Return Value

**true** if the sets are not equal; **false** if sets are equal.

### Remarks

The comparison between set objects is based on a pairwise comparison between their elements. Two sets are equal if they have the same number of elements and their respective elements have the same values. Otherwise, they are unequal.

### Example

```cpp
// set_op_ne.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <set>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   set <int> s1, s2, s3;
   int i;

   for ( i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ )
   {
      s1.insert ( i );
      s2.insert ( i * i );
      s3.insert ( i );
   }

   if ( s1 != s2 )
      cout << "The sets s1 and s2 are not equal." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The sets s1 and s2 are equal." << endl;

   if ( s1 != s3 )
      cout << "The sets s1 and s3 are not equal." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The sets s1 and s3 are equal." << endl;
}
\* Output:
The sets s1 and s2 are not equal.
The sets s1 and s3 are equal.
*\
```

## <a name="op_lt"></a>  operator&lt; (set)

Tests if the set object on the left side of the operator is less than the set object on the right side.

```cpp
bool operator<(const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& left, const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& right);
```

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
An object of type `set`.

*right*<br/>
An object of type `set`.

### Return Value

**true** if the set on the left side of the operator is strictly less than the set on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.

### Remarks

The comparison between set objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. The less-than relationship between two objects is based on a comparison of the first pair of unequal elements.

### Example

```cpp
// set_op_lt.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <set>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   set <int> s1, s2, s3;
   int i;

   for ( i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ )
   {
      s1.insert ( i );
      s2.insert ( i * i );
      s3.insert ( i - 1 );
   }

   if ( s1 < s2 )
      cout << "The set s1 is less than the set s2." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The set s1 is not less than the set s2." << endl;

   if ( s1 < s3 )
      cout << "The set s1 is less than the set s3." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The set s1 is not less than the set s3." << endl;
}
\* Output:
The set s1 is less than the set s2.
The set s1 is not less than the set s3.
*\
```

## <a name="op_lt_eq"></a>  operator&lt;= (set)

Tests if the set object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the set object on the right side.

```cpp
bool operator!<=(const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& left, const set <Key, Traits, Allocator>& right);
```

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
An object of type `set`.

*right*<br/>
An object of type `set`.

### Return Value

**true** if the set on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the set on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.

### Remarks

The comparison between set objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. The less than or equal to relationship between two objects is based on a comparison of the first pair of unequal elements.

### Example

```cpp
// set_op_le.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <set>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   set <int> s1, s2, s3, s4;
   int i;

   for ( i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++ )
   {
      s1.insert ( i );
      s2.insert ( i * i );
      s3.insert ( i - 1 );
      s4.insert ( i );
   }

   if ( s1 <= s2 )
      cout << "Set s1 is less than or equal to the set s2." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The set s1 is greater than the set s2." << endl;

   if ( s1 <= s3 )
      cout << "Set s1 is less than or equal to the set s3." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The set s1 is greater than the set s3." << endl;

   if ( s1 <= s4 )
      cout << "Set s1 is less than or equal to the set s4." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The set s1 is greater than the set s4." << endl;
}
\* Output:
Set s1 is less than or equal to the set s2.
