# mem_fun1_t Class

An adapter class that allows a `non_const` member function that takes a single argument to be called as a binary function object when initialized with a pointer argument.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class Result, class Type, class Arg>
class mem_fun1_t : public binary_function<Type *, Arg, Result> {
    explicit mem_fun1_t(
    Result (Type::* _Pm)(Arg));

    Result operator()(
    Type* _Pleft,
    Arg right) const;

};
```

### Parameters

*_Pm*
 A pointer to the member function of class `Type` to be converted to a function object.

*_Pleft*
 The object that the *_Pm* member function is called on.

*right*
 The argument that is being given to *_Pm*.

## Return Value

An adaptable binary function.

## Remarks

The template class stores a copy of *_Pm*, which must be a pointer to a member function of class `Type`, in a private member object. It defines its member function `operator()` as returning ( **_Pleft**->\* `_Pm`)( **right**).

## Example

The constructor of `mem_fun1_t` is not usually used directly; the helper function `mem_fun` is used to adapt member functions. See [mem_fun](../standard-library/functional-functions.md#mem_fun) for an example of how to use member function adaptors.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<functional>

**Namespace:** std
