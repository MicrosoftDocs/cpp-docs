# `<new>`

Defines several types and functions that control the allocation and freeing of storage under program control. It also defines components for reporting on storage management errors.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<new>

**Namespace:** std

## Remarks

Some of the functions declared in this header are replaceable. The implementation supplies a default version, whose behavior is described in this document. A program can, however, define a function with the same signature to replace the default version at link time. The replacement version must satisfy the requirements described in this document.

## Members

### Objects

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|[nothrow](../standard-library/new-functions.md#nothrow)|Provides an object to be used as an argument for the **`nothrow`** versions of **`new`** and **`delete`**.|

### Typedefs

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|[new_handler](../standard-library/new-typedefs.md#new_handler)|A type that points to a function suitable for use as a new handler.|
|[hardware_constructive_interference_size](../standard-library/new-typedefs.md#hardware_constructive_interference_size)||
|[hardware_destructive_interference_size](../standard-library/new-typedefs.md#hardware_destructive_interference_size)||

### Functions

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|[get_new_handler](../standard-library/new-functions.md#get_new_handler)||
|[launder](../standard-library/new-functions.md#launder)||
|[set_new_handler](../standard-library/new-functions.md#set_new_handler)|Installs a user function that is called when new fails in its attempt to allocate memory.|

### Operators

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|[`operator delete`](../standard-library/new-operators.md#op_delete)|The function called by a delete expression to deallocate storage for individual of objects.|
|[`operator delete[]`](../standard-library/new-operators.md#op_delete_arr)|The function called by a delete expression to deallocate storage for an array of objects.|
|[`operator new`](../standard-library/new-operators.md#op_new)|The function called by a new expression to allocate storage for individual objects.|
|[`operator new[]`](../standard-library/new-operators.md#op_new_arr)|The function called by a new expression to allocate storage for an array of objects.|

### Enums

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|[align_val_t](../standard-library/new-operators.md#op_align_val_t)||

### Classes

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|[bad_alloc Class](../standard-library/bad-alloc-class.md)|The class describes an exception thrown to indicate that an allocation request did not succeed.|
|[bad_array_new_length Class](../standard-library/bad-array-new-length.md)||
|[nothrow_t Class](../standard-library/nothrow-t-structure.md)|The class is used as a function parameter to operator new to indicate that the function should return a null pointer to report an allocation failure, rather than throw an exception.|
