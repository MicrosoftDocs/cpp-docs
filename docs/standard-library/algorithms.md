# Algorithms

Algorithms are a fundamental part of the C++ Standard Library. Algorithms do not work with containers themselves but rather with iterators. Therefore, the same algorithm can be used by most if not all of the C++ Standard Library containers. This section discusses the conventions and terminology of the C++ Standard Library algorithms.

## Remarks

The descriptions of the algorithm template functions employ several shorthand phrases:

- The phrase "in the range [*A*, *B*)" means the sequence of zero or more discrete values beginning with *A* up to but not including *B*. A range is valid only if *B* is reachable from *A;* you can store *A* in an object *N* (*N* = *A*), increment the object zero or more times (++*N*), and have the object compare equal to *B* after a finite number of increments (N == B*).*

- The phrase "each *N* in the range [*A*, *B*)" means that *N* begins with the value *A* and is incremented zero or more times until it equals the value *B*. The case *N* == *B* is not in the range.

- The phrase "the lowest value of *N* in the range [*A*, *B*) such that *X*" means that the condition *X* is determined for each *N* in the range [*A*, *B*) until the condition *X* is met.

- The phrase "the highest value of *N* in the range [*A*, *B*) such that *X* means that *X* is determined for each *N* in the range [*A*, *B*). The function stores in `K` a copy of *N* each time the condition *X* is met. If any such store occurs, the function replaces the final value of *N*, which equals *B*, with the value of `K`. For a bidirectional or random-access iterator, however, it can also mean that *N* begins with the highest value in the range and is decremented over the range until the condition *X* is met.

- Expressions such as *X* - *Y*, where *X* and *Y* can be iterators other than random-access iterators, are intended in the mathematical sense. The function does not necessarily evaluate operator**-** if it must determine such a value. The same is also true for expressions such as *X* + *N* and *X* - *N*, where *N* is an integer type.

Several algorithms make use of a predicate that performs a pairwise comparison, such as with `operator==`, to yield a **bool** result. The predicate function `operator==`, or any replacement for it, must not alter either of its operands. It must yield the same **bool** result every time it is evaluated, and it must yield the same result if a copy of either operand is substituted for the operand.

Several algorithms make use of a predicate that must impose a strict weak ordering on pairs of elements from a sequence. For the predicate `pr`(*X*, *Y*):

- Strict means that `pr`(*X*, *X*) is false.

- Weak means that *X* and *Y* have an equivalent ordering if !`pr`(*X*, *Y*) && !`pr`(*Y*, *X*) (*X* == *Y* does not need to be defined).

- Ordering means that `pr`(*X*, *Y*) && `pr`(*Y*, Z) implies `pr`(*X*, Z).

Some of these algorithms implicitly use the predicate *X* \< *Y*. Other predicates that typically satisfy the strict weak ordering requirement are *X* > *Y*, `less`(*X*, *Y*), and `greater`(*X*, *Y*). Note, however, that predicates such as *X* \<= *Y* and *X* >= *Y* do not satisfy this requirement.

A sequence of elements designated by iterators in the range [`First`, `Last`) is a sequence ordered by operator**<** if, for each *N* in the range [0, `Last` - `First`) and for each *M* in the range (N, `Last` - `First`) the predicate !(\*(`First` + *M*) < \*(*First* + *N*)) is true. (Note that the elements are sorted in ascending order.) The predicate function `operator<`, or any replacement for it, must not alter either of its operands. It must yield the same `bool` result every time it is evaluated, and it must yield the same result if a copy of either operand is substituted for the operand. Moreover, it must impose a strict weak ordering on the operands it compares.

A sequence of elements designated by iterators in the range [`First`, `Last`) is a heap ordered by `operator<` if, for each *N* in the range [1, `Last` - `First`) the predicate !(\*`First` < \*(`First` + *N*)) is true. (The first element is the largest.) Its internal structure is otherwise known only to the template functions [make_heap](../standard-library/algorithm-functions.md#make_heap), [pop_heap](../standard-library/algorithm-functions.md#pop_heap), and [push_heap](../standard-library/algorithm-functions.md#push_heap). As with an ordered sequence, the predicate function `operator<`, or any replacement for it, must not alter either of its operands, and it must impose a strict weak ordering on the operands it compares. It must yield the same **bool** result every time it is evaluated, and it must yield the same result if a copy of either operand is substituted for the operand.

The C++ Standard Library algorithms are located in the [\<algorithm>](../standard-library/algorithm.md) and [\<numeric>](../standard-library/numeric.md) header files.
