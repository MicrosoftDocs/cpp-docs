# complex&lt;long double&gt;
Describes an object that stores an ordered pair of objects both of type `long double`, the first representing the real part of a complex number and the second representing the imaginary part.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
template <>
class complex<long double> {
public:
    constexpr complex(
    long double _RealVal = 0,
    long double _ImagVal = 0);

complex(
    constexpr complex<long double>& complexNum);
// rest same as template class complex
};
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_RealVal`  
 The value of type **long double** for the real part of the complex number being constructed.  
  
 `_ImagVal`  
 The value of type `long double` for the imaginary part of the complex number being constructed.  
  
 ` complexNum`  
 The complex number of type **double** or of type **float** whose real and imaginary parts are used to initialize a complex number of type `long double` being constructed.  
  
## Return Value  
 A complex number of type `long double`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The explicit specialization of the template class complex to a complex class of type `long double` differs from the template class only in the constructors it defines. The conversion from `long double` to **float** is allowed to be implicit, but the conversion from **double** to `long double` is required to be **explicit**. The use of **explicit** rules out the initiation with type conversion using assignment syntax.  
  
 For more information on the template class `complex`, see [complex Class](../standard-library/complex-class.md). For a list of members of the template class `complex`, see .  
  
## Example  
  
```cpp  
// complex_comp_ld.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <complex>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;  
   double pi = 3.14159265359;  
  
   // The first constructor specifies real & imaginary parts  
   complex <long double> c1 ( 4.0 , 5.0 );  
   cout << "Specifying initial real & imaginary parts,\n"  
        << " as type float gives c1 = " << c1 << endl;  
  
   // The second constructor initializes values of the real &  
   // imaginary parts using those of complex number of type float  
   complex <float> c2float ( 1.0 , 3.0 );  
   complex <long double> c2longdouble ( c2float );  
   cout << "Implicit conversion from type float to type long double,"  
        << "\n gives c2longdouble = " << c2longdouble << endl;  
  
   // The third constructor initializes values of the real &  
   // imaginary parts using those of a complex number  
   // of type double  
   complex <double> c3double ( 3.0 , 4.0 );  
   complex <long double> c3longdouble ( c3double );  
   cout << "Implicit conversion from type long double to type float,"  
        << "\n gives c3longdouble = " << c3longdouble << endl;  
  
   // The modulus and argument of a complex number can be recovered  
   double absc3 = abs ( c3longdouble );  
   double argc3 = arg ( c3longdouble );  
   cout << "The modulus of c3 is recovered from c3 using: abs ( c3 ) = "  
        << absc3 << endl;  
   cout << "Argument of c3 is recovered from c3 using:\n arg ( c3 ) = "  
        << argc3 << " radians, which is " << argc3 * 180 / pi  
        << " degrees." << endl;  
}  
\* Output:   
Specifying initial real & imaginary parts,  
 as type float gives c1 = (4,5)  
Implicit conversion from type float to type long double,  
 gives c2longdouble = (1,3)  
Implicit conversion from type long double to type float,  
 gives c3longdouble = (3,4)  
The modulus of c3 is recovered from c3 using: abs ( c3 ) = 5  
Argument of c3 is recovered from c3 using:  
 arg ( c3 ) = 0.927295 radians, which is 53.1301 degrees.
