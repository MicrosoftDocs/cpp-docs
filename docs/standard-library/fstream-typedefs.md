##  <a name="filebuf"></a>  filebuf  
 A type `basic_filebuf` specialized on `char` template parameters.  
  
```
typedef basic_filebuf<char, char_traits<char>> filebuf;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The type is a synonym for template class [basic_filebuf](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md), specialized for elements of type `char` with default character traits.  
  
##  <a name="fstream"></a>  fstream  
 A type `basic_fstream` specialized on `char` template parameters.  
  
```
typedef basic_fstream<char, char_traits<char>> fstream;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The type is a synonym for template class [basic_fstream](../standard-library/basic-fstream-class.md), specialized for elements of type `char` with default character traits.  
  
##  <a name="ifstream"></a>  ifstream  
 Defines a stream to be used to read single-byte character data serially from a file. `ifstream` is a typedef that specializes the template class `basic_ifstream` for `char`.  
  
 There is also `wifstream`, a typedef that specializes `basic_ifstream` to read `wchar_t` double-wide characters. For more information, see [wifstream](../standard-library/fstream-typedefs.md#wifstream).  
  
```
typedef basic_ifstream<char, char_traits<char>> ifstream;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The type is a synonym for template class [basic_ifstream](../standard-library/basic-ifstream-class.md), specialized for elements of type char with default character traits. An example is  
  
 `using namespace std;`  
  
 `ifstream infile("existingtextfile.txt");`  
  
 `if (!infile.bad())`  
  
 `{`  
  
 `// Dump the contents of the file to cout.`  
  
 `cout << infile.rdbuf();`  
  
 `infile.close();`  
  
 `}`  
  
##  <a name="ofstream"></a>  ofstream  
 A type `basic_ofstream` specialized on `char` template parameters.  
  
```
typedef basic_ofstream<char, char_traits<char>> ofstream;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The type is a synonym for template class [basic_ofstream](../standard-library/basic-ofstream-class.md), specialized for elements of type `char` with default character traits.  
  
##  <a name="wfstream"></a>  wfstream  
 A type `basic_fstream` specialized on `wchar_t` template parameters.  
  
```
typedef basic_fstream<wchar_t, char_traits<wchar_t>> wfstream;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The type is a synonym for template class [basic_fstream](../standard-library/basic-fstream-class.md), specialized for elements of type `wchar_t` with default character traits.  
  
##  <a name="wifstream"></a>  wifstream  
 A type `basic_ifstream` specialized on `wchar_t` template parameters.  
  
```
typedef basic_ifstream<wchar_t, char_traits<wchar_t>> wifstream;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The type is a synonym for template class [basic_ifstream](../standard-library/basic-ifstream-class.md), specialized for elements of type `wchar_t` with default character traits.  
  
##  <a name="wofstream"></a>  wofstream  
 A type `basic_ofstream` specialized on `wchar_t` template parameters.  
  
```
typedef basic_ofstream<wchar_t, char_traits<wchar_t>> wofstream;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The type is a synonym for template class [basic_ofstream](../standard-library/basic-ofstream-class.md), specialized for elements of type `wchar_t` with default character traits.  
  
##  <a name="wfilebuf"></a>  wfilebuf  
 A type `basic_filebuf` specialized on `wchar_t` template parameters.  
  
```
typedef basic_filebuf<wchar_t, char_traits<wchar_t>> wfilebuf;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The type is a synonym for template class [basic_filebuf](../standard-library/basic-filebuf-class.md), specialized for elements of type `wchar_t` with default character traits.
