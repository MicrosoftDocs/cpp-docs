# `<new>` functions

## <a name="get_new_handler"></a> get_new_handler

```cpp
new_handler get_new_handler() noexcept;
```

### Remarks

Returns the current `new_handler`.

## <a name="launder"></a> launder

```cpp
template <class T>
    constexpr T* launder(T* ptr) noexcept;
```

### Parameters

*ptr*\
The address of a byte in memory that holds an object whose type is similar to *T*.

### Return Value

A value of type *T\** that points to X.

### Remarks

Also referred to as a pointer optimization barrier.

Used as a constant expression when the value of its argument may be used in a constant expression. A byte of storage is reachable through a pointer value that points to an object if within the storage occupied by another object, an object with a similar pointer.

### Example

```cpp
struct X { const int n; };

X *p = new X{3};
const int a = p->n;
new (p) X{5}; // p does not point to new object because X::n is const
const int b = p->n; // undefined behavior
const int c = std::launder(p)->n; // OK
```

## <a name="nothrow"></a> nothrow

Provides an object to be used as an argument for the **`nothrow`** versions of **`new`** and **`delete`**.

```cpp
extern const std::nothrow_t nothrow;
```

### Remarks

The object is used as a function argument to match the parameter type [std::nothrow_t](../standard-library/nothrow-t-structure.md).

### Example

See [`operator new`](../standard-library/new-operators.md#op_new) and [`operator new[]`](../standard-library/new-operators.md#op_new_arr) for examples of how `std::nothrow_t` is used as a function parameter.

## <a name="set_new_handler"></a> set_new_handler

Installs a user function that is to be called when **operator new** fails in its attempt to allocate memory.

```cpp
new_handler set_new_handler(new_handler Pnew) throw();
```

### Parameters

*`Pnew`*\
The `new_handler` to be installed.

### Return Value

0 on the first call and the previous `new_handler` on subsequent calls.

### Remarks

The function stores *`Pnew`* in a static [`new` handler](../standard-library/new-typedefs.md#new_handler) pointer that it maintains, then returns the value previously stored in the pointer. The `new` handler is used by [`operator new`](../standard-library/new-operators.md#op_new).

### Example

```cpp
// new_set_new_handler.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <new>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
void __cdecl newhandler( )
{
   cout << "The new_handler is called:" << endl;
   throw bad_alloc( );
   return;
}

int main( )
{
   set_new_handler (newhandler);
   try
   {
      while ( 1 )
      {
         new int[5000000];
         cout << "Allocating 5000000 ints." << endl;
      }
   }
   catch ( exception e )
   {
      cout << e.what( ) << endl;
   }
}
```

```Output
Allocating 5000000 ints.
Allocating 5000000 ints.
Allocating 5000000 ints.
Allocating 5000000 ints.
