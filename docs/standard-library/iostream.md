# &lt;iostream&gt;

Declares objects that control reading from and writing to the standard streams. This is often the only header you need to include to perform input and output from a C++ program.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <iostream>

```

## Remarks

The objects fall into two groups:

- [cin](#cin), [cout](#cout), [cerr](#cerr), and [clog](#clog) are byte oriented, performing conventional byte-at-a-time transfers.

- [wcin](#wcin), [wcout](#wcout), [wcerr](#wcerr), and [wclog](#wclog) are wide oriented, translating to and from the wide characters that the program manipulates internally.

Once you perform certain operations on a stream, such as the standard input, you cannot perform operations of a different orientation on the same stream. Therefore, a program cannot operate interchangeably on both [cin](#cin) and [wcin](#wcin), for example.

All the objects declared in this header share a peculiar property â€” you can assume they are constructed before any static objects you define, in a translation unit that includes \<iostream>. Equally, you can assume that these objects are not destroyed before the destructors for any such static objects you define. (The output streams are, however, flushed during program termination.) Therefore, you can safely read from or write to the standard streams before program startup and after program termination.

This guarantee is not universal, however. A static constructor may call a function in another translation unit. The called function cannot assume that the objects declared in this header have been constructed, given the uncertain order in which translation units participate in static construction. To use these objects in such a context, you must first construct an object of class [ios_base::Init](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#init).

### Global Stream Objects

|||
|-|-|
|[cerr](#cerr)|Specifies the `cerr` global stream.|
|[cin](#cin)|Specifies the `cin` global stream.|
|[clog](#clog)|Specifies the `clog` global stream.|
|[cout](#cout)|Specifies the `cout` global stream.|
|[wcerr](#wcerr)|Specifies the `wcerr` global stream.|
|[wcin](#wcin)|Specifies the `wcin` global stream.|
|[wclog](#wclog)|Specifies the `wclog` global stream.|
|[wcout](#wcout)|Specifies the `wcout` global stream.|

###  <a name="cerr"></a>  cerr

The object `cerr` controls output to a stream buffer associated with the object `stderr`, declared in \<cstdio>.

```cpp
extern ostream cerr;
```

#### Return Value

An [ostream](../standard-library/ostream-typedefs.md#ostream) object.

#### Remarks

The object controls unbuffered insertions to the standard error output as a byte stream. Once the object is constructed, the expression `cerr.`[flags](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#flags) `&` [unitbuf](../standard-library/ios-functions.md#unitbuf) is nonzero, and `cerr.tie() == &cout`.

#### Example

```cpp
// iostream_cerr.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

void TestWide( )
{
   int i = 0;
   wcout << L"Enter a number: ";
   wcin >> i;
   wcerr << L"test for wcerr" << endl;
   wclog << L"test for wclog" << endl;
}

int main( )
{
   int i = 0;
   cout << "Enter a number: ";
   cin >> i;
   cerr << "test for cerr" << endl;
   clog << "test for clog" << endl;
   TestWide( );
}
```

###  <a name="cin"></a>  cin

Specifies the `cin` global stream.

```cpp
extern istream cin;
```

#### Return Value

An [istream](../standard-library/istream-typedefs.md#istream) object.

#### Remarks

The object controls extractions from the standard input as a byte stream. Once the object is constructed, the call `cin.`[tie](../standard-library/basic-ios-class.md#tie) returns `&`[cout](#cout).

#### Example

In this example, `cin` sets the fail bit on the stream when it encounters non-numeric characters. The program clears the fail bit and strips the invalid character from the stream to proceed.

```cpp
// iostream_cin.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int x;
   cout << "enter choice:";
   cin >> x;
   while (x < 1 || x > 4)
   {
      cout << "Invalid choice, try again:";
      cin >> x;
      // not a numeric character, probably
      // clear the failure and pull off the non-numeric character
      if (cin.fail())
      {
         cin.clear();
         char c;
         cin >> c;
      }
   }
}
```

```Output

2

```

###  <a name="clog"></a>  clog

Specifies the `clog` global stream.

```cpp
extern ostream clog;
```

#### Return Value

An [ostream](../standard-library/ostream-typedefs.md#ostream) object.

#### Remarks

The object controls buffered insertions to the standard error output as a byte stream.

#### Example

See [cerr](#cerr) for an example of using `clog`.

###  <a name="cout"></a>  cout

Specifies the `cout` global stream.

```cpp
extern ostream cout;
```

#### Return Value

An [ostream](../standard-library/ostream-typedefs.md#ostream) object.

#### Remarks

The object controls insertions to the standard output as a byte stream.

#### Example

See [cerr](#cerr) for an example of using `cout`.

###  <a name="wcerr"></a>  wcerr

Specifies the `wcerr` global stream.

```cpp
extern wostream wcerr;
```

#### Return Value

A [wostream](../standard-library/ostream-typedefs.md#wostream) object.

#### Remarks

The object controls unbuffered insertions to the standard error output as a wide stream. Once the object is constructed, the expression `wcerr.`[flags](../standard-library/ios-base-class.md#flags) `&` [unitbuf](../standard-library/ios-functions.md#unitbuf) is nonzero.

#### Example

See [cerr](#cerr) for an example of using `wcerr`.

###  <a name="wcin"></a>  wcin

Specifies the `wcin` global stream.

```cpp
extern wistream wcin;
```

#### Return Value

A [wistream](../standard-library/istream-typedefs.md#wistream) object.

#### Remarks

The object controls extractions from the standard input as a wide stream. Once the object is constructed, the call `wcin.`[tie](../standard-library/basic-ios-class.md#tie) returns `&`[wcout](#wcout).

#### Example

See [cerr](#cerr) for an example of using `wcin`.

###  <a name="wclog"></a>  wclog

Specifies the `wclog` global stream.

```cpp
extern wostream wclog;
```

#### Return Value

A [wostream](../standard-library/ostream-typedefs.md#wostream) object.

#### Remarks

The object controls buffered insertions to the standard error output as a wide stream.

#### Example

See [cerr](#cerr) for an example of using `wclog`.

###  <a name="wcout"></a>  wcout

Specifies the `wcout` global stream.

```cpp
extern wostream wcout;
```

#### Return Value

A [wostream](../standard-library/ostream-typedefs.md#wostream) object.

#### Remarks

The object controls insertions to the standard output as a wide stream.

#### Example

See [cerr](#cerr) for an example of using `wcout`.

`CString` instances in a `wcout` statement must be cast to `const wchar_t*`, as shown in the following example.

```

    CString cs("meow");

    wcout <<(const wchar_t*) cs <<endl;
```

For more information, see [Basic CString Operations](../atl-mfc-shared/basic-cstring-operations.md).
