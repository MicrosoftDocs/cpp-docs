# &lt;functional&gt;

Defines C++ Standard Library functions that help construct *function objects*—also known as functors—and their binders. A function object is an object of a type that defines `operator()`. A function object can be a function pointer, but more typically, the object is used to store additional information that can be accessed during a function call.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <functional>
```

## Remarks

Algorithms require two types of function objects: unary and binary. Unary function objects require one argument, and binary function objects require two arguments. A function object and function pointers can be passed as a predicate to an algorithm, but function objects are also adaptable and increase the scope, flexibility, and efficiency of the C++ Standard Library. If, for example, a value needed to be bound to a function before being passed to an algorithm, then a function pointer could not be used. Function adaptors convert function pointers into adaptable function objects that can be bound to a value. The header \<functional> also contains member function adaptors that allow member functions to be called as adaptable function objects. Functions are adaptable if they have nested type declarations specifying their argument and return types. The C++ Standard requires that this adaptability is implemented by having all standard object classes inherit from the unary_function or binary_function base classes. Function objects and their adaptors allow the C++ Standard Library to upgrade existing applications and help integrate the library into the C++ programming environment.

The Visual C++ implementation of the function objects in \<functional> includes *transparent operator functors*, which are specializations of standard function objects and take no template parameters, and perform perfect forwarding of the function arguments and perfect return of the result. This feature is part of the C++14 Draft Standard specification. These template specializations do not require that you specify argument types when you invoke arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operator functors. You can overload arithmetic, comparison, logical, or bitwise operators for your own types, or for heterogeneous combinations of types, and then use the transparent operator functors as function arguments. For example, if your type *MyType* implements `operator<`, you can call `sort(my_collection.begin(), my_collection.end(), less<>())` instead of explicitly specifying the type `sort(my_collection.begin(), my_collection.end(), less<MyType>())`.

## C++11/C++14 Implementation

The following features are added in the Visual C++ implementation of C++11/C++14:

- A *call signature* is the name of a return type followed by a parenthesized comma-separated list of zero or more argument types.

- A *callable type* is a pointer to function, a pointer to member function, a pointer to member data, or a class type whose objects can appear immediately to the left of a function call operator.

- A *callable object* is an object of a callable type.

- A *call wrapper type* is a type that holds a callable object and supports a call operation that forwards to that object.

- A *call wrapper* is an object of a call wrapper type.

- A *target object* is the callable object held by a call wrapper object.

The pseudo-function `INVOKE(f, t1, t2, ..., tN)` means one of the following things:

- `(t1.*f)(t2, ..., tN)` when `f` is a pointer to member function of class `T` and `t1` is an object of type `T` or a reference to an object of type `T` or a reference to an object of a type derived from `T`.

- `((*t1).*f)(t2, ..., tN)` when `f` is a pointer to member function of class `T` and `t1` is not one of the types described in the previous item.

- `t1.*f` when N == 1 and `f` is a pointer to member data of a class `T` and `t1` is an object of type `T` or a reference to an object of type `T` or a reference to an object of a type derived from `T`.

- `(*t1).*f` when N == 1 and `f` is a pointer to member data of a class `T` and `t1` is not one of the types described in the previous item.

- `f(t1, t2, ..., tN)` in all other cases.

The pseudo-function `INVOKE(f, t1, t2, ..., tN, R)` means `INVOKE(f, t1, t2, ..., tN)` implicitly converted to `R`.

If a call wrapper has a *weak result type*, the type of its member type `result_type` is based on the type `T` of the target object of the wrapper, as follows:

- If `T` is a pointer to function, `result_type` is a synonym for the return type of `T`.

- If `T` is a pointer to member function, `result_type` is a synonym for the return type of `T`.

- If `T` is a class type that has a member type `result_type`, then `result_type` is a synonym for `T::result_type`.

- Otherwise, there is no member `result_type`.

Every call wrapper has a move constructor and a copy constructor. A *simple call wrapper* is a call wrapper that has an assignment operator and whose copy constructor, move constructor, and assignment operator do not throw exceptions. A *forwarding call wrapper* is a call wrapper that can be called by using an arbitrary argument list and that delivers the arguments to the wrapped callable object as references. All rvalue arguments are delivered as rvalue references, and lvalue arguments are delivered as lvalue references.
