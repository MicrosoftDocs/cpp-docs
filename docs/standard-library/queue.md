|[operator<](../standard-library/queue-operators.md#operator_lt_)|Tests if the queue object on the left side of the operator is less than the queue object on the right side.|  
|[operator\<=](../standard-library/queue-operators.md#operator_lt__eq)|Tests if the queue object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the queue object on the right side.|  
|[operator==](../standard-library/queue-operators.md#operator_eq_eq)|Tests if the queue object on the left side of the operator is equal to the queue object on the right side.|  
|[operator>](../standard-library/queue-operators.md#operator_gt_)|Tests if the queue object on the left side of the operator is greater than the queue object on the right side.|
