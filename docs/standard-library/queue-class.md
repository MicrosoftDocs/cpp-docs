# queue Class

A template container adaptor class that provides a restriction of functionality for some underlying container type, limiting access to the front and back elements. Elements can be added at the back or removed from the front, and elements can be inspected at either end of the queue.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class Type, class Container = deque <Type>>
class queue
```

### Parameters

*Type*<br/>
The element data type to be stored in the queue

*Container*<br/>
The type of the underlying container used to implement the queue.

## Remarks

The elements of class `Type` stipulated in the first template parameter of a queue object are synonymous with [value_type](#value_type) and must match the type of element in the underlying container class `Container` stipulated by the second template parameter. The `Type` must be assignable, so that it is possible to copy objects of that type and to assign values to variables of that type.

Suitable underlying container classes for queue include [deque](../standard-library/deque-class.md) and [list](../standard-library/list-class.md), or any other sequence container that supports the operations of `front`, `back`, `push_back`, and `pop_front`. The underlying container class is encapsulated within the container adaptor, which exposes only the limited set of the sequence container member functions as a public interface.

The queue objects are equality comparable if and only if the elements of class `Type` are equality comparable, and are less-than comparable if and only if the elements of class `Type` are less-than comparable.

There are three types of container adaptors defined by the C++ Standard Library: stack, queue, and priority_queue. Each restricts the functionality of some underlying container class to provide a precisely controlled interface to a standard data structure.

- The [stack class](../standard-library/stack-class.md) supports a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. A good analogue to keep in mind would be a stack of plates. Elements (plates) may be inserted, inspected, or removed only from the top of the stack, which is the last element at the end of the base container. The restriction to accessing only the top element is the reason for using the stack class.

- The queue class supports a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. A good analogue to keep in mind would be people lining up for a bank teller. Elements (people) may be added to the back of the line and are removed from the front of the line. Both the front and the back of a line may be inspected. The restriction to accessing only the front and back elements in this way is the reason for using the queue class.

- The [priority_queue class](../standard-library/priority-queue-class.md) orders its elements so that the largest element is always at the top position. It supports insertion of an element and the inspection and removal of the top element. A good analogue to keep in mind would be people lining up where they are arranged by age, height, or some other criterion.

### Constructors

|Constructor|Description|
|-|-|
|[queue](#queue)|Constructs a `queue` that is empty or that is a copy of a base container object.|

### Typedefs

|Type name|Description|
|-|-|
|[container_type](#container_type)|A type that provides the base container to be adapted by the `queue`.|
|[size_type](#size_type)|An unsigned integer type that can represent the number of elements in a `queue`.|
|[value_type](#value_type)|A type that represents the type of object stored as an element in a `queue`.|

### Member functions

|Member function|Description|
|-|-|
|[back](#back)|Returns a reference to the last and most recently added element at the back of the `queue`.|
|[empty](#empty)|Tests if the `queue` is empty.|
|[front](#front)|Returns a reference to the first element at the front of the `queue`.|
|[pop](#pop)|Removes an element from the front of the `queue`.|
|[push](#push)|Adds an element to the back of the `queue`.|
|[size](#size)|Returns the number of elements in the `queue`.|

## Requirements

**Header:** \<queue>

**Namespace:** std

## <a name="back"></a>  queue::back

Returns a reference to the last and most recently added element at the back of the queue.

```cpp
reference back();

const_reference back() const;
```

### Return Value

The last element of the queue. If the queue is empty, the return value is undefined.

### Remarks

If the return value of `back` is assigned to a `const_reference`, the queue object cannot be modified. If the return value of `back` is assigned to a `reference`, the queue object can be modified.

When compiled by using [_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL](../standard-library/iterator-debug-level.md) defined as 1 or 2, a runtime error will occur if you attempt to access an element in an empty queue.  See [Checked Iterators](../standard-library/checked-iterators.md) for more information.

### Example

```cpp
// queue_back.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   queue <int> q1;

   q1.push( 10 );
   q1.push( 11 );

   int& i = q1.back( );
   const int& ii = q1.front( );

   cout << "The integer at the back of queue q1 is " << i
        << "." << endl;
   cout << "The integer at the front of queue q1 is " << ii
        << "." << endl;
}
```

## <a name="container_type"></a>  queue::container_type

A type that provides the base container to be adapted.

```cpp
typedef Container container_type;
```

### Remarks

The type is a synonym for the template parameter `Container`. Two C++ Standard Library sequence container classes — the list class and the default deque class — meet the requirements to be used as the base container for a queue object. User-defined types satisfying the requirements may also be used.

For more information on `Container`, see the Remarks section of the [queue Class](../standard-library/queue-class.md) topic.

### Example

See the example for [queue](#queue) for an example of how to declare and use `container_type`.

## <a name="empty"></a>  queue::empty

Tests if a queue is empty.

```cpp
bool empty() const;
```

### Return Value

**true** if the queue is empty; **false** if the queue is nonempty.

### Example

```cpp
// queue_empty.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
using namespace std;

   // Declares queues with default deque base container
   queue <int> q1, q2;

   q1.push( 1 );

   if ( q1.empty( ) )
      cout << "The queue q1 is empty." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The queue q1 is not empty." << endl;

   if ( q2.empty( ) )
      cout << "The queue q2 is empty." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The queue q2 is not empty." << endl;
}
```

```Output
The queue q1 is not empty.
The queue q2 is empty.
```

## <a name="front"></a>  queue::front

Returns a reference to the first element at the front of the queue.

```cpp
reference front();

const_reference front() const;
```

### Return Value

The first element of the queue. If the queue is empty, the return value is undefined.

### Remarks

If the return value of `front` is assigned to a `const_reference`, the queue object cannot be modified. If the return value of `front` is assigned to a `reference`, the queue object can be modified.

The member function returns a `reference` to the first element of the controlled sequence, which must be nonempty.

When compiled by using [_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL](../standard-library/iterator-debug-level.md) defined as 1 or 2, a runtime error will occur if you attempt to access an element in an empty queue.  See [Checked Iterators](../standard-library/checked-iterators.md) for more information.

### Example

```cpp
// queue_front.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
   using namespace std;
   queue <int> q1;

   q1.push( 10 );
   q1.push( 20 );
   q1.push( 30 );

   queue <int>::size_type i;
   i = q1.size( );
   cout << "The queue length is " << i << "." << endl;

   int& ii = q1.back( );
   int& iii = q1.front( );

   cout << "The integer at the back of queue q1 is " << ii
        << "." << endl;
   cout << "The integer at the front of queue q1 is " << iii
        << "." << endl;
}
```

## <a name="pop"></a>  queue::pop

Removes an element from the front of the queue.

```cpp
void pop();
```

### Remarks

The queue must be nonempty to apply the member function. The top of the queue is the position occupied by the most recently added element and is the last element at the end of the container.

### Example

```cpp
// queue_pop.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   queue <int> q1, s2;

   q1.push( 10 );
   q1.push( 20 );
   q1.push( 30 );

   queue <int>::size_type i;
   i = q1.size( );
   cout << "The queue length is " << i << "." << endl;

   i = q1.front( );
   cout << "The element at the front of the queue is "
        << i << "." << endl;

   q1.pop( );

   i = q1.size( );
   cout << "After a pop the queue length is "
        << i << "." << endl;

   i = q1. front ( );
   cout << "After a pop, the element at the front of the queue is "
        << i << "." << endl;
}
```

```Output
The queue length is 3.
The element at the front of the queue is 10.
After a pop the queue length is 2.
After a pop, the element at the front of the queue is 20.
```

## <a name="push"></a>  queue::push

Adds an element to the back of the queue.

```cpp
void push(const Type& val);
```

### Parameters

*val*<br/>
The element added to the back of the queue.

### Remarks

The back of the queue is the position occupied by the most recently added element and is the last element at the end of the container.

### Example

```cpp
// queue_push.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   queue <int> q1;

   q1.push( 10 );
   q1.push( 20 );
   q1.push( 30 );

   queue <int>::size_type i;
   i = q1.size( );
   cout << "The queue length is " << i << "." << endl;

   i = q1.front( );
   cout << "The element at the front of the queue is "
        << i << "." << endl;
}
```

```Output
The queue length is 3.
The element at the front of the queue is 10.
```

## <a name="queue"></a>  queue::queue

Constructs a queue that is empty or that is a copy of a base container object.

```cpp
queue();

explicit queue(const container_type& right);
```

### Parameters

*right*<br/>
The **const** container of which the constructed queue is to be a copy.

### Remarks

The default base container for queue is deque. You can also specify list as a base container, but you cannot specify vector, because it lacks the required `pop_front` member function.

### Example

```cpp
// queue_queue.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;

   // Declares queue with default deque base container
   queue <char> q1;

   // Explicitly declares a queue with deque base container
   queue <char, deque<char> > q2;

   // These lines don't cause an error, even though they
   // declares a queue with a vector base container
   queue <int, vector<int> > q3;
   q3.push( 10 );
   // but the following would cause an error because vector has
   // no pop_front member function
   // q3.pop( );

   // Declares a queue with list base container
   queue <int, list<int> > q4;

   // The second member function copies elements from a container
   list<int> li1;
   li1.push_back( 1 );
   li1.push_back( 2 );
   queue <int, list<int> > q5( li1 );
   cout << "The element at the front of queue q5 is "
        << q5.front( ) << "." << endl;
   cout << "The element at the back of queue q5 is "
        << q5.back( ) << "." << endl;
}
```

```Output
The element at the front of queue q5 is 1.
The element at the back of queue q5 is 2.
```

## <a name="size"></a>  queue::size

Returns the number of elements in the queue.

```cpp
size_type size() const;
```

### Return Value

The current length of the queue.

### Example

```cpp
// queue_size.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   queue <int> q1, q2;
   queue <int>::size_type i;

   q1.push( 1 );
   i = q1.size( );
   cout << "The queue length is " << i << "." << endl;

   q1.push( 2 );
   i = q1.size( );
   cout << "The queue length is now " << i << "." << endl;
}
```

```Output
The queue length is 1.
The queue length is now 2.
```

## <a name="size_type"></a>  queue::size_type

An unsigned integer type that can represent the number of elements in a queue.

```cpp
typedef typename Container::size_type size_type;
```

### Remarks

The type is a synonym for the `size_type` of the base container adapted by the queue.

### Example

See the example for [queue::front](#front) for an example of how to declare and use `size_type`.

## <a name="value_type"></a>  queue::value_type

A type that represents the type of object stored as an element in a queue.

```cpp
typedef typename Container::value_type value_type;
```

### Remarks

The type is a synonym for the `value_type` of the base container adapted by the queue.

### Example

```cpp
// queue_value_type.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
using namespace std;

   // Declares queues with default deque base container
   queue<int>::value_type AnInt;

   AnInt = 69;
   cout << "The value_type is AnInt = " << AnInt << endl;

   queue<int> q1;
   q1.push(AnInt);
   cout << "The element at the front of the queue is "
        << q1.front( ) << "." << endl;
}
```

```Output
The value_type is AnInt = 69
The element at the front of the queue is 69.
```
