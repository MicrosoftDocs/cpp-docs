# C++ Standard Library Overview

All C++ library entities are declared or defined in one or more standard headers. This implementation includes two additional headers, \<hash_map> and \<hash_set>, that are not required by the C++ Standard. For a complete list of headers that this implementation supports, see [Header Files Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-header-files.md).

A freestanding implementation of the C++ library provides only a subset of these headers:

|||
|-|-|
|[\<cstddef>](../standard-library/cstddef.md)|[\<cstdlib>](../standard-library/cstdlib.md) (declaring at least the functions `abort`, `atexit`, and `exit`)|
|[\<exception>](../standard-library/exception.md)|[\<limits>](../standard-library/limits.md)|
|[\<new>](../standard-library/new.md)|[\<cstdarg>](../standard-library/cstdarg.md)|

The C++ library headers have two broader subdivisions:

- [iostreams](../standard-library/iostreams-conventions.md) conventions.

- [C++ Standard Library Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md) conventions.

This section contains the following sections:

- [Using C++ Library Headers](../standard-library/using-cpp-library-headers.md)

- [C++ Library Conventions](../standard-library/cpp-library-conventions.md)

- [iostreams Conventions](../standard-library/iostreams-conventions.md)

- [C++ Program Startup and Termination](../standard-library/cpp-program-startup-and-termination.md)

- [Safe Libraries: C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/safe-libraries-cpp-standard-library.md)

- [Checked Iterators](../standard-library/checked-iterators.md)

- [Debug Iterator Support](../standard-library/debug-iterator-support.md)

- [C++ Standard Library Reference](../standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference.md)

- [Thread Safety in the C++ Standard Library](../standard-library/thread-safety-in-the-cpp-standard-library.md)

- [stdext Namespace](../standard-library/stdext-namespace.md)

- [Regular Expressions (C++)](../standard-library/regular-expressions-cpp.md)
