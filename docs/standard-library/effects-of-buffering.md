# Effects of Buffering

The following example shows the effects of buffering. You might expect the program to print `please wait`, wait 5 seconds, and then proceed. It will not necessarily work this way, however, because the output is buffered.

```cpp
// effects_buffering.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <iostream>
#include <time.h>
using namespace std;

int main( )
{
   time_t tm = time( NULL ) + 5;
   cout << "Please wait...";
   while ( time( NULL ) < tm )
      ;
   cout << "\nAll done" << endl;
}
```

To make the program work logically, the `cout` object must empty itself when the message is to appear. To flush an `ostream` object, send it the `flush` manipulator:

```cpp
cout <<"Please wait..." <<flush;
```

This step flushes the buffer, ensuring the message prints before the wait. You can also use the `endl` manipulator, which flushes the buffer and outputs a carriage return-linefeed, or you can use the `cin` object. This object (with the `cerr` or `clog` objects) is usually tied to the `cout` object. Thus, any use of `cin` (or of the `cerr` or `clog` objects) flushes the `cout` object.
