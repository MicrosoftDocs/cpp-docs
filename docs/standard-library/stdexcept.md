# &lt;stdexcept&gt;

Defines several standard classes used for reporting exceptions. The classes form a derivation hierarchy all derived from class [exception](../standard-library/exception-class.md) and include two general types of exceptions: logical errors and run-time errors. The logical errors are caused programmer mistakes. They derive from the base class logic_error and include:

- `domain_error`

- `invalid_argument`

- `length_error`

- `out_of_range`

The run-time errors occur because of mistakes in either the library functions or in the run-time system. They derive from the base class runtime_error and include:

- `overflow_error`

- `range_error`

- `underflow_error`

### Classes

|Class|Description|
|-|-|
|[domain_error Class](../standard-library/domain-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report a domain error.|
|[invalid_argument Class](../standard-library/invalid-argument-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report an invalid argument.|
|[length_error Class](../standard-library/length-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report an attempt to generate an object too long to be specified.|
|[logic_error Class](../standard-library/logic-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report errors presumably detectable before the program executes, such as violations of logical preconditions.|
|[out_of_range Class](../standard-library/out-of-range-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report an argument that is out of its valid range.|
|[overflow_error Class](../standard-library/overflow-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report an arithmetic overflow.|
|[range_error Class](../standard-library/range-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report a range error.|
|[runtime_error Class](../standard-library/runtime-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report errors presumably detectable only when the program executes.|
|[underflow_error Class](../standard-library/underflow-error-class.md)|The class serves as the base class for all exceptions thrown to report an arithmetic underflow.|
