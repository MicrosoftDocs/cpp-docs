# &lt;chrono&gt;

Include the standard header \<chrono> to define classes and functions that represent and manipulate time durations and time instants.

Beginning in Visual Studio 2015, the implementation of `steady_clock` has changed to meet the C++ Standard requirements for steadiness and monotonicity. `steady_clock` is now based on QueryPerformanceCounter() and `high_resolution_clock` is now a typedef for `steady_clock`. As a result, in Visual C++ `steady_clock::time_point` is now a typedef for `chrono::time_point<steady_clock>`; however, this is not necessarily the case for other implementations.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <chrono>
```

### Classes

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[duration Class](../standard-library/duration-class.md)|Describes a type that holds a time interval.|
|[time_point Class](../standard-library/time-point-class.md)|Describes a type that represents a point in time.|

### Structs

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[common_type Structure](../standard-library/common-type-structure.md)|Describes specializations of template class [common_type](../standard-library/common-type-class.md) for instantiations of `duration` and `time_point`.|
|[duration_values Structure](../standard-library/duration-values-structure.md)|Provides specific values for the `duration` template parameter `Rep`.|
|[steady_clock struct](../standard-library/steady-clock-struct.md)|Represents a `steady` clock.|
|[system_clock Structure](../standard-library/system-clock-structure.md)|Represents a *clock type* that is based on the real-time clock of the system.|
|[treat_as_floating_point Structure](../standard-library/treat-as-floating-point-structure.md)|Specifies whether a type can be treated as a floating-point type.|

### Functions

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[duration_cast](../standard-library/chrono-functions.md#duration_cast)|Casts a `duration` object to a specified type.|
|[time_point_cast](../standard-library/chrono-functions.md#time_point_cast)|Casts a `time_point` object to a specified type.|

### Operators

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[operator-](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#operator-)|Operator for subtraction or negation of `duration` and `time_point` objects.|
|[operator!=](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#op_neq)|Inequality operator that is used with `duration` or `time_point` objects.|
|[operator modulo](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#op_modulo)|Operator for modulo operations on `duration` objects.|
|[operator*](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#op_star)|Multiplication operator for `duration` objects.|
|[operator/](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#op_div)|Division operator for `duration` objects.|
|[operator+](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#op_add)|Adds `duration` and `time_point` objects.|
|[operator&lt;](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#op_lt)|Determines whether one `duration` or `time_point` object is less than another `duration` or `time_point` object.|
|[operator&lt;=](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#op_lt_eq)|Determines whether one `duration` or `time_point` object is less than or equal to another `duration` or `time_point` object.|
|[operator==](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#op_eq_eq)|Determines whether two `duration` objects represent time intervals that have the same length, or whether two `time_point` objects represent the same point in time.|
|[operator&gt;](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#op_gt)|Determines whether one `duration` or `time_point` object is greater than another `duration` or `time_point` object.|
|[operator&gt;=](../standard-library/chrono-operators.md#op_gt_eq)|Determines whether one `duration` or `time_point` object is greater than or equal to another `duration` or `time_point` object.|

### Predefined Duration Types

For more information about ratio types that are used in the following typedefs, see [\<ratio>](../standard-library/ratio.md).

|Typedef|Description|
|-------------|-----------------|
|`typedef duration<long long, nano> nanoseconds;`|Synonym for a `duration` type that has a tick period of one nanosecond.|
|`typedef duration<long long, micro> microseconds;`|Synonym for a `duration` type that has a tick period of one microsecond.|
|`typedef duration<long long, milli> milliseconds;`|Synonym for a `duration` type that has a tick period of one millisecond.|
|`typedef duration<long long> seconds;`|Synonym for a `duration` type that has a tick period of one second.|
|`typedef duration<int, ratio<60> > minutes;`|Synonym for a `duration` type that has a tick period of one minute.|
|`typedef duration<int, ratio<3600> > hours;`|Synonym for a `duration` type that has a tick period of one hour.|

### Literals

**(C++11)**The \<chrono> header defines the following [user-defined literals](../cpp/user-defined-literals-cpp.md) that you can use for greater convenience, type-safety and maintainability of your code. These literals are defined in the `literals::chrono_literals` inline namespace and are in scope when std::chrono is in scope.

|Literal|Description|
|-------------|-----------------|
|chrono::hours operator "" h(unsigned long long Val)|Specifies hours as an integral value.|
|chrono::duration\<double, ratio\<3600> > operator "" h(long double Val)|Specifies hours as a floating-point value.|
|chrono::minutes (operator "" min)(unsigned long long Val)|Specifies minutes as an integral value.|
|chrono::duration\<double, ratio\<60> > (operator "" min)( long double Val)|Specifies minutes as a floating-point value.|
|chrono::seconds operator "" s(unsigned long long Val)|Specifies minutes as an integral value.|
|chrono::duration\<double> operator "" s(long double Val)|Specifies seconds as a floating-point value.|
|chrono::milliseconds operator "" ms(unsigned long long Val)|Specifies milliseconds as an integral value.|
|chrono::duration\<double, milli> operator "" ms(long double Val)|Specifies milliseconds as a floating-point value.|
|chrono::microseconds operator "" us(unsigned long long Val)|Specifies microseconds as an integral value.|
|chrono::duration\<double, micro> operator "" us(long double Val)|Specifies microseconds as a floating-point value.|
|chrono::nanoseconds operator "" ns(unsigned long long Val)|Specifies nanoseconds as an integral value.|
|chrono::duration\<double, nano> operator "" ns(long double Val)|Specifies nanoseconds as a floating-point value.|
|||

The following examples show how to use the chrono literals.

```cpp
constexpr auto day = 24h;
constexpr auto week = 24h* 7;
constexpr auto my_duration_unit = 108ms;
```
