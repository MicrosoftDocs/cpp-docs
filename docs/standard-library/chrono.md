# `<chrono>`

Include the standard header `<chrono>` to define classes and functions that represent and manipulate time durations and time instants.

Beginning in Visual Studio 2015, the implementation of `steady_clock` has changed to meet the C++ Standard requirements for steadiness and monotonicity:
- `steady_clock` is now based on `QueryPerformanceCounter()`
- `high_resolution_clock` is now a typedef for `steady_clock`
In the Microsoft C++ implementation, `steady_clock::time_point` is now a `typedef` for `chrono::time_point<steady_clock>`.  However, this isn't necessarily the case for other implementations.

## Requirements

**Header:** `<chrono>`

Regional legislatures occasionally make changes to time zones, and an international standards body specifies when new leap seconds should be accounted for. A database of these changes was added to Windows 10. Specifically:

| Feature | Client version | Server version |
|--|--|--|
| Leap second database updates | Windows 10 version 1809 or later | Windows Server 2019 or later |
| Time zone support | Windows 10 version 1903/19H1 or later | Windows Server 2022 or later |

Using the time-zone facilities on older versions of Windows results in a runtime error.

**Namespace:** `std`

## Literals

**(C++11)** The `<chrono>` header defines the following [user-defined literals](../cpp/user-defined-literals-cpp.md) that you can use for greater convenience, type-safety, and maintainability of your code. These literals are defined in the `literals::chrono_literals` inline namespace and are in scope when `std::chrono` is in scope.

| Declaration | Description |
|--|--|
| `hours operator "" h(unsigned long long Val)` | Specifies hours as an integral value. |
| `duration<double, ratio<3600>> operator "" h(long double Val)` | Specifies hours as a floating-point value. |
| `minutes (operator "" min)(unsigned long long Val)` | Specifies minutes as an integral value. |
| `duration<double, ratio<60>> (operator "" min)( long double Val)` | Specifies minutes as a floating-point value. |
| `seconds operator "" s(unsigned long long Val)` | Specifies minutes as an integral value. |
| `duration<double> operator "" s(long double Val)` | Specifies seconds as a floating-point value. |
| `milliseconds operator "" ms(unsigned long long Val)` | Specifies milliseconds as an integral value. |
| `duration<double, milli> operator "" ms(long double Val)` | Specifies milliseconds as a floating-point value. |
| `microseconds operator "" us(unsigned long long Val)` | Specifies microseconds as an integral value. |
| `duration<double, micro> operator "" us(long double Val)` | Specifies microseconds as a floating-point value. |
| `nanoseconds operator "" ns(unsigned long long Val)` | Specifies nanoseconds as an integral value. |
| `duration<double, nano> operator "" ns(long double Val)` | Specifies nanoseconds as a floating-point value. |

The following examples show how to use `<chrono>` literals:

```cpp
constexpr auto day = 24h;
constexpr auto week = 24h* 7;
constexpr auto my_duration_unit = 108ms;
```
