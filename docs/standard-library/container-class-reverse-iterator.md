# Container Class::reverse_iterator
> [!NOTE]
>  This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the Standard C++ Library. For more information, see [STL Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).  
  
 Describes an object that can serve as a reverse iterator for the controlled sequence.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
 
typedef T7 reverse_iterator;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type **T7** (typically `reverse_iterator` **\<**[iterator](../standard-library/container-class-iterator.md)**>**).
