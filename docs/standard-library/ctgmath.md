# `<ctgmath>`

In effect, includes the C++ standard library headers `<complex>` and `<cmath>`, which provide type-generic math macros equivalent to `<tgmath.h>`.

> [!NOTE]
> The C standard library `<tgmath.h>` header isn't included by `<ctgmath>` because it's effectively replaced by the C++ overloads in `<complex>` and `<cmath>`. That makes the `<ctgmath>` header redundant. The `<tgmath.h>` header is deprecated in C++. The `<ctgmath>` header is deprecated in C++17 and removed in the draft C++20 standard.

## Requirements

**Header:** `<ctgmath>`

**Namespace:** `std`

## Remarks

The functionality of the C standard library header `<tgmath.h>` is provided by the overloads in `<complex>` and `<cmath>`.
