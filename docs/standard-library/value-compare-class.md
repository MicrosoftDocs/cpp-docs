# value_compare Class

Provides a function object that can compare the elements of a hash_map by comparing the values of their keys to determine their relative order in the hash_map.

## Syntax

```cpp
class value_compare
 : std::public binary_function<value_type, value_type, bool>
{
public:
    bool operator()(
    const value_type& left,
    const value_type& right) const
 {
    return (comp(left.first, right.first));

}
protected:
    value_compare(const key_compare& c) : comp (c) { }
    key_compare comp;
};
```

## Remarks

The comparison criteria provided by value_compare between `value_types` of whole elements contained by a hash_map is induced from a comparison between the keys of the respective elements by the auxiliary class construction. The member function operator uses the object `comp` of type `key_compare` stored in the function object provided by value_compare to compare the sort-key components of two elements.

For hash_sets and hash_multisets, which are simple containers where the key values are identical to the element values, value_compare is equivalent to `key_compare`; for hash_maps and hash_multimaps they are not, because the value of the type `pair` elements is not identical to the value of the element's key.

## Example

See the example for [hash_map::value_comp](../standard-library/hash-map-class.md#value_comp) for an example of how to declare and use value_compare.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<hash_map>

**Namespace:** stdext
