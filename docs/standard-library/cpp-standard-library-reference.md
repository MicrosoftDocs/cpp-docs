# C++ Standard Library reference

A C++ program can call on a large number of functions from this conforming implementation of the C++ Standard Library. These functions perform services such as input and output and provide efficient implementations of frequently used operations.

For more information about linking with the appropriate Visual C++ runtime .lib file, see [C Runtime (CRT) and C++ Standard Library .`lib` files](../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).
