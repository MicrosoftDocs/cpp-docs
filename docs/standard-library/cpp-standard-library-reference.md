# C++ Standard Library Reference

A C++ program can call on a large number of functions from this conforming implementation of the C++ Standard Library. These functions perform essential services such as input and output and provide efficient implementations of frequently used operations.

For more information about Visual C++ run-time libraries, see [CRT Library Features](../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).
