# &lt;ccomplex&gt;

Includes the C++ Standard Library header [\<complex>](../standard-library/complex.md), which effectively includes the Standard C library header \<complex.h> and adds the associated names to the `std` namespace.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <ccomplex>
```

## Remarks

Including this header ensures that the names declared using external linkage in the Standard C library header are declared in the `std` namespace.

The name `clog`, which is declared in \<complex.h>, is not defined in the `std` namespace because of potential conflicts with the `clog` that is declared in [\<iostream>](../standard-library/iostream.md).
