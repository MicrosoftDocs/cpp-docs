# `steady_clock` struct

Represents a clock that is never adjusted and that moves forward at a uniform rate.

## Syntax

```cpp
struct steady_clock;
```

## Remarks

A `steady_clock` is a monotonic clock, which means that the time it reports only moves forward. The value returned by a call to `now` is always less than or equal to the value that is returned by the next call to `now`.

A `steady_clock` ensures that the time between ticks is constant, making it better for measuring intervals than using a system clock. The system clock provides wall-clock time. The problem with using wall-clock time to measure elapsed time is that wall-clock time may get modified while measuring a time interval. It could be modified by synchronizing with another clock over the network, by a transition to daylight savings time, and so on. A `steady_clock` isn't subject to these adjustments, making it the preferred way to keep track of elapsed time.

`high_resolution_clock` is a typedef for `steady_clock`. On Windows, `steady_clock` wraps the `QueryPerformanceCounter` function.

## Example

```cpp
#include <chrono> 
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std::chrono;

int main()
{
    auto begin = steady_clock::now();
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
    auto end = steady_clock::now();
    
    std::cout << "Elapsed seconds:      "
        << duration_cast<seconds>(end - begin).count()
        << "s\n";

    std::cout << "Elapsed milliseconds: "
        << duration_cast<milliseconds>(end - begin).count()
        << "ms\n";

    std::cout << "Elapsed microseconds: "
        << duration_cast<microseconds>(end - begin).count()
        << "us\n";

    std::cout << "Elapsed nanoseconds:  "
        << duration_cast<nanoseconds>(end - begin).count()
        << " ns\n";

    return 0;
}
```

```Output
Elapsed seconds:      1s
Elapsed milliseconds: 1007ms
Elapsed microseconds: 1007266us
Elapsed nanoseconds:  1007266700 ns
```

### Convenience type aliases

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|`steady_clock::duration`|In Microsoft's implementation, it's a synonym for `nanoseconds`, which is defined as `duration<long long, nano>`. It represents a duration of time measured in billionths of a second. |
|`steady_clock::period`|In Microsoft's implementation, it's a synonym for `nano`, which is defined as `std::ratio<1i64, 1000000000i64>` . It represents the time in seconds (one billionth of a second) between each tick in the duration.|
|`steady_clock::rep`|A synonym for **`long long`**, which is the type used in the Microsoft implementation to represent the number of clock ticks in a `steady_clock::duration`|
|`steady_clock::time_point`|A synonym for `time_point<steady_clock>`. Used to represent a `time_point` for this clock. |

## Public functions

|Function|Description|
|--------------|-----------------|
|`now`|Returns the current time from the `steady_clock` as a `time_point` value.|

## Public constants

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|`steady_clock::is_steady`|Holds **`true`**. A `steady_clock` is *steady*. That means you can use this clock to get the time before an event, the time after an event, and reliably subtract them to get the duration of the event because the clock won't be adjusted during that time.|
