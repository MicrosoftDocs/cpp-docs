# Container Class::reference

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the C++ Standard Library. For more information, see [C++ Standard Library Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).

Describes an object that can serve as a reference to an element of the controlled sequence.

## Syntax

```

typedef T2 reference;
```

## Remarks

It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type `T2` (typically `Alloc::reference`). An object of type `reference` can be cast to an object of type [const_reference](../standard-library/container-class-const-reference.md).
