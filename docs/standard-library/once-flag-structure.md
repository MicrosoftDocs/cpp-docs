# once_flag Structure

Represents a **`struct`** that is used with the template function [call_once](../standard-library/mutex-functions.md#call_once) to ensure that initialization code is called only once, even in the presence of multiple threads of execution.

## Syntax

```cpp
struct once_flag
{
   constexpr once_flag() noexcept;
};
```

## Remarks

The `once_flag` **`struct`** has only a default constructor.

Objects of type `once_flag` can be created, but they cannot be copied.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<mutex>

**Namespace:** std
