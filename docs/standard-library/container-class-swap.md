# Container Class::swap

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the C++ Standard Library. For more information, see [C++ Standard Library Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).

Swaps the controlled sequences between **\*this** and its argument.

## Syntax

```cpp
void swap(Container& right);
```

## Remarks

If **\*this.get\_allocator ==** _right_**.get_allocator**, it does a swap in constant time. Otherwise, it performs a number of element assignments and constructor calls proportional to the number of elements in the two controlled sequences.
