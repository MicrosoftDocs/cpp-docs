## <a name="op_neq"></a>  operator!=

Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is not equal to the deque object on the right side.

```cpp
bool operator!=(const deque<Type, Allocator>& left, const deque<Type, Allocator>& right);
```

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
An object of type `deque`.

*right*<br/>
An object of type `deque`.

### Return Value

**true** if the deque objects are not equal; **false** if the deque objects are equal.

### Remarks

The comparison between deque objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. Two deque objects are equal if they have the same number of elements and their respective elements have the same values. Otherwise, they are unequal.

### Example

```cpp
// deque_op_ne.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   deque <int> c1, c2;

   c1.push_back( 1 );
   c2.push_back( 2 );

   if ( c1 != c2 )
      cout << "The deques are not equal." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The deques are equal." << endl;
}
\* Output:
The deques are not equal.
*\
```

## <a name="op_lt"></a>  operator&lt;

Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is less than the deque object on the right side.

```cpp
bool operator<(const deque<Type, Allocator>& left, const deque<Type, Allocator>& right);
```

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
An object of type `deque`.

*right*<br/>
An object of type `deque`.

### Return Value

**true** if the deque on the left side of the operator is less than and not equal to the deque on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.

### Remarks

The comparison between deque objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. The less-than relationship between two objects is based on a comparison of the first pair of unequal elements.

### Example

```cpp
// deque_op_lt.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   deque <int> c1, c2;

   c1.push_back( 1 );
   c1.push_back( 2 );
   c1.push_back( 4 );

   c2.push_back( 1 );
   c2.push_back( 3 );

   if ( c1 < c2 )
      cout << "Deque c1 is less than deque c2." << endl;
   else
      cout << "Deque c1 is not less than deque c2." << endl;
}
\* Output:
Deque c1 is less than deque c2.
*\
```

## <a name="op_lt_eq"></a>  operator&lt;=

Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the deque object on the right side.

```cpp
bool operator<=(const deque<Type, Allocator>& left, const deque<Type, Allocator>& right);
```

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
An object of type `deque`.

*right*<br/>
An object of type `deque`.

### Return Value

**true** if the deque on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the deque on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.

### Remarks

The comparison between deque objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. The less than or equal to relationship between two objects is based on a comparison of the first pair of unequal elements.

### Example

```cpp
// deque_op_le.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   deque <int> c1, c2;

   c1.push_back( 1 );
   c1.push_back( 2 );
   c1.push_back( 4 );

   c2.push_back( 1 );
   c2.push_back( 3 );

   if ( c1 <= c2 )
      cout << "Deque c1 is less than or equal to deque c2." << endl;
   else
      cout << "Deque c1 is greater than deque c2." << endl;
}
\* Output:
Deque c1 is less than or equal to deque c2.
*\

```

## <a name="op_eq_eq"></a>  operator==

Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is equal to the deque object on the right side.

```cpp
bool operator==(const deque<Type, Allocator>& left, const deque<Type, Allocator>& right);
```

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
An object of type `deque`.

*right*<br/>
An object of type `deque`.

### Return Value

**true** if the deque on the left side of the operator is equal to the deque on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.

### Remarks

The comparison between deque objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. Two deques are equal if they have the same number of elements and their respective elements have the same values. Otherwise, they are unequal.

### Example

```cpp
// deque_op_eq.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   deque <int> c1, c2;

   c1.push_back( 1 );
   c2.push_back( 1 );

   if ( c1 == c2 )
      cout << "The deques are equal." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The deques are not equal." << endl;

   c1.push_back( 1 );
   if ( c1 == c2 )
      cout << "The deques are equal." << endl;
   else
      cout << "The deques are not equal." << endl;
}
\* Output:
The deques are equal.
The deques are not equal.
*\

```

## <a name="op_gt"></a>  operator&gt;

```cpp
bool operator>(const deque<Type, Allocator>& left, const deque<Type, Allocator>& right);

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
An object of type `deque`.

*right*<br/>
An object of type `deque`.

### Return Value

**true** if the deque on the left side of the operator is greater than the deque on the right side of the operator; otherwise **false**.

### Remarks

The comparison between deque objects is based on a pairwise comparison of their elements. The greater-than relationship between two objects is based on a comparison of the first pair of unequal elements.

### Example

```cpp
// deque_op_gt.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   deque <int> c1, c2;

   c1.push_back( 1 );
   c1.push_back( 3 );
   c1.push_back( 1 );

   c2.push_back( 1 );
   c2.push_back( 2 );
   c2.push_back( 2 );

   if ( c1 > c2 )
      cout << "Deque c1 is greater than deque c2." << endl;
   else
      cout << "Deque c1 is not greater than deque c2." << endl;

\* Output:
Deque c1 is greater than deque c2.
*\

```

## <a name="op_gt_eq"></a>  operator&gt;=
