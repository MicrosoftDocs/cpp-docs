# value_compare Class (&lt;map&gt;)

Provides a function object that can compare the elements of a map by comparing the values of their keys to determine their relative order in the map.

## Syntax

```cpp
class value_compare : public binary_function<value_type, value_type, bool>
{
public:
    bool operator()(const value_type& left, const value_type& right) const;
    value_compare(key_compare pred) : comp(pred);
protected:
    key_compare comp;
};
```

## Remarks

The comparison criterion provided by `value_compare` between `value_types` of whole elements contained by a map is induced from a comparison between the keys of the respective elements by the auxiliary class construction. The member function operator uses the object `comp` of type `key_compare` stored in the function object provided by `value_compare` to compare the sort-key components of two elements.

For sets and multisets, which are simple containers where the key values are identical to the element values, `value_compare` is equivalent to `key_compare`; for maps and multimaps they are not, as the value of the type `pair` elements is not identical to the value of the element's key.

## Example

See example for [value_comp](../standard-library/map-class.md#value_comp) for an example of how to declare and use `value_compare`.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<map>

**Namespace:** std
