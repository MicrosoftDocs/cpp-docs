## <a name="pointer_safety"></a>  pointer_safety Enumeration

The enumeration of possible values returned by `get_pointer_safety`.

class pointer_safety {
   relaxed,
   preferred,
   strict
   };

### Remarks

The scoped **enum** defines the values that can be returned by `get_pointer_safety()`:

`relaxed` -- pointers not safely derived (obviously pointers to declared or allocated objects) are treated the same as those safely derived.

`preferred` -- as before, but pointers not safely derived should not be dereferenced.

`strict` -- pointers not safely derived might be treated differently than those safely derived.
