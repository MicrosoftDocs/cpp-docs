# `<utility>`

Defines C++ Standard Library types, functions, and operators that help to construct and manage pairs of objects, which are useful whenever two objects should be treated as if they were one.

## Requirements

**Header:** `<utility>`

**Namespace:** `std`

## Remarks

Pairs are widely used in the C++ Standard Library. They're required both as the arguments and return values for various functions and as element types for associative containers like [`map`](../standard-library/map-class.md) and [`multimap`](../standard-library/multimap-class.md).

## Members

### Classes

|Type|Description|
|-|-|
|[`chars_format`](../standard-library/chars-format-class.md)|Floating-point format for primitive numerical conversion.|
|[`tuple_element`](../standard-library/tuple-element-class-tuple.md)|Wraps the type of a `pair` element.|
|[`tuple_size`](../standard-library/tuple-size-class-tuple.md)|Wraps a `pair` element count.|

### Objects

|Template|Description|
|-|-|
|[`index_sequence`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#index_sequence)|An alias template defined for the common case where `T` is `std::size_t`  |
|[`index_sequence_for`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#index_sequence_for)|Helper alias template to convert any type parameter pack into an index sequence of the same length|
|[`make_index_sequence`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#make_index_sequence)| Helper alias template to simplify the creation of a `std::index_sequence` type. |
|[`make_integer_sequence`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#make_integer_sequence)|Helper alias template to simplify the creation of a `std::integer_sequence` type.|

### Functions

|Function|Description|
|-|-|
|[`as_const`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#asconst)|Returns type.|
|[`declval`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#declval)|Shorthand expression evaluation.|
|[`exchange`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#exchange)|Assigns a new value to an object and returns its old value.|
|[`forward`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#forward)|Preserves the reference type (either `lvalue` or `rvalue`) of the argument from being obscured by perfect forwarding.|
|[`from_chars`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#from_chars)||
|[`get`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#get)|A function that gets an element from a `pair` object.|
|[`make_pair`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#make_pair)|A template helper function used to construct objects of type `pair`, where the component types are based on the data types passed as parameters.|
|[`move`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#move)|Returns the passed in argument as an `rvalue` reference.|
|[`move_if_noexcept`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#moveif)||
|[`swap`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#swap)|Exchanges the elements of two `pair` objects.|
|[`to_chars`](../standard-library/utility-functions.md#to_chars)|Converts value into a character string.|

### Operators

|Operator|Description|
|-|-|
|[`operator!=`](../standard-library/utility-operators.md#op_neq)|Tests if the pair object on the left side of the operator isn't equal to the pair object on the right side.|
|[`operator==`](../standard-library/utility-operators.md#op_eq_eq)|Tests if the pair object on the left side of the operator is equal to the pair object on the right side.|
|[`operator<`](../standard-library/utility-operators.md#op_lt)|Tests if the pair object on the left side of the operator is less than the pair object on the right side.|
|[`operator<=`](../standard-library/utility-operators.md#op_lt_eq)|Tests if the pair object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the pair object on the right side.|
|[`operator>`](../standard-library/utility-operators.md#op_gt)|Tests if the pair object on the left side of the operator is greater than the pair object on the right side.|
|[`operator>=`](../standard-library/utility-operators.md#op_gt_eq)|Tests if the pair object on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the pair object on the right side.|

### Structs

|Struct|Description|
|-|-|
|[`from_chars_result`](../standard-library/from-chars-result-structure.md)|A struct used for `from_chars`.|
|[`identity`](../standard-library/identity-structure.md)|A struct that provides a type definition as the template parameter.|
|[`in_place_t`, `in_place_type_t`, `in_place_index_t`](../standard-library/in-place-t-struct.md)| Indicates how to create an object in place.|
|[`integer_sequence`](../standard-library/integer-sequence-class.md)|Represents an integer sequence.|
|[`pair`](../standard-library/pair-structure.md)|A type that provides for the ability to treat two objects as a single object.|
|[`piecewise_construct_t`](../standard-library/piecewise-construct-t-structure.md)|A type used to keep separate constructor and function overloading.|
|[`to_chars_result`](../standard-library/to-chars-result-structure.md)|A struct used for `to_chars`.|
