# &lt;atomic&gt; enums

## <a name="memory_order_enum"></a>  memory_order Enum

Supplies symbolic names for synchronization operations on memory locations. These operations affect how assignments in one thread become visible in another.

```cpp
typedef enum memory_order {
    memory_order_relaxed,
    memory_order_consume,
    memory_order_acquire,
    memory_order_release,
    memory_order_acq_rel,
    memory_order_seq_cst,
} memory_order;
```

### Enumeration members

|||
|-|-|
|`memory_order_relaxed`|No ordering required.|
|`memory_order_consume`|A load operation acts as a consume operation on the memory location.|
|`memory_order_acquire`|A load operation acts as an acquire operation on the memory location.|
|`memory_order_release`|A store operation acts as a release operation on the memory location.|
|`memory_order_acq_rel`|Combines `memory_order_acquire` and `memory_order_release`.|
|`memory_order_seq_cst`|Combines `memory_order_acquire` and `memory_order_release`. Memory accesses that are marked as `memory_order_seq_cst` must be sequentially consistent.|
