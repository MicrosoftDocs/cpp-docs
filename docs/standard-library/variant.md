# `<variant>`

A variant object holds and manages a value. If the variant holds a value, that value's type has to be one of the template argument types given to variant. These template arguments are called alternatives.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<variant>

**Namespace:** std

## Members

### Operators

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|[operator==](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#op_eq_eq)|Tests if the variant object on the left side of the operator is equal to the variant object on the right side.|
|[operator!=](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#op_neq)|Tests if the variant object on the left side of the operator is not equal to the variant object on the right side.|
|[operator<](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#op_lt)|Tests if the variant object on the left side of the operator is less than the variant object on the right side.|
|[operator<=](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#op_lt_eq)|Tests if the variant object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the variant object on the right side.|
|[operator>](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#op_gt)|Tests if the variant object on the left side of the operator is greater than the variant object on the right side.|
|[operator>=](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#op_gt_eq)|Tests if the variant object on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the variant object on the right side.|

### Functions

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|[get](../standard-library/variant-functions.md#get)|Gets the variant of an object.|
|[get_if](../standard-library/variant-functions.md#get_if)|Gets the variant of an object if it exists.|
|[holds_alternative](../standard-library/variant-functions.md#holds_alternative)|Return **`true`** if a variant exists.|
|[swap](../standard-library/variant-functions.md#swap)|Swaps a **variant**.|
|[visit](../standard-library/variant-functions.md#visit)|Moves to the next **variant**.|

### Classes

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|[bad_variant_access](../standard-library/bad-variant-access-class.md)|Objects thrown to report invalid accesses to the value of a variant object.|
|[variant](../standard-library/variant.md)|An object to either hold a value of one of its alternative types, or no value.|

### Structs

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|[hash](../standard-library/hash-structure.md)||
|[monostate](../standard-library/monostate-structure.md)|An alternative type for a variant to make the variant type default constructible.|
