# &lt;mutex&gt;

Include the standard header \<mutex> to define the classes `mutex`, `recursive_mutex`, `timed_mutex`, and `recursive_timed_mutex`; the templates `lock_guard` and `unique_lock`; and supporting types and functions that define mutual-exclusion code regions.

> [!WARNING]
> Beginning in Visual Studio 2015, the C++ Standard Library synchronization types are based on Windows synchronization primitives and no longer use ConcRT (except when the target platform is Windows XP). The types defined in \<mutex> should not be used with any ConcRT types or functions.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <mutex>
```

## Remarks

> [!NOTE]
> In code that is compiled by using **/clr**, this header is blocked.

The classes `mutex` and `recursive_mutex` are *mutex types*. A mutex type has a default constructor and a destructor that does not throw exceptions. These objects have methods that provide mutual exclusion when multiple threads try to lock the same object. Specifically, a mutex type contains the methods `lock`, `try_lock`, and `unlock`:

- The `lock` method blocks the calling thread until the thread obtains ownership of the mutex. Its return value is ignored.

- The `try_lock` method tries to obtain ownership of the mutex without blocking. Its return type is convertible to **bool** and is **true** if the method obtains ownership, but is otherwise **false**.

- The `unlock` method releases the ownership of the mutex from the calling thread.

You can use mutex types as type arguments to instantiate the templates `lock_guard` and `unique_lock`. You can use objects of these types as the `Lock` argument to the wait member functions in the template [condition_variable_any](../standard-library/condition-variable-any-class.md).

A *timed mutex type* satisfies the requirements for a mutex type. In addition, it has the `try_lock_for` and `try_lock_until` methods that must be callable by using one argument and must return a type that is convertible to **bool**. A timed mutex type can define these functions by using additional arguments, provided that those additional arguments all have default values.

- The `try_lock_for` method must be callable by using one argument, `Rel_time`, whose type is an instantiation of [chrono::duration](../standard-library/duration-class.md). The method tries to obtain ownership of the mutex, but returns within the time that is designated by `Rel_time`, regardless of success. The return value converts to **true** if the method obtains ownership; otherwise, the return value converts to **false**.

- The `try_lock_until` method must be callable by using one argument, `Abs_time`, whose type is an instantiation of [chrono::time_point](../standard-library/time-point-class.md). The method tries to obtain ownership of the mutex, but returns no later than the time that is designated by `Abs_time`, regardless of success. The return value converts to **true** if the method obtains ownership; otherwise, the return value converts to **false**.

A mutex type is also known as a *lockable type*. If it does not provide the member function `try_lock`, it is a *basic lockable type*. A timed mutex type is also known as a *timed lockable type*.

### Classes

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[lock_guard Class](../standard-library/lock-guard-class.md)|Represents a template that can be instantiated to create an object whose destructor unlocks a `mutex`.|
|[mutex Class (C++ Standard Library)](../standard-library/mutex-class-stl.md)|Represents a mutex type. Use objects of this type to enforce mutual exclusion within a program.|
|[recursive_mutex Class](../standard-library/recursive-mutex-class.md)|Represents a mutex type. In constrast to the `mutex` class, the behavior of calling locking methods for objects that are already locked is well-defined.|
|[recursive_timed_mutex Class](../standard-library/recursive-timed-mutex-class.md)|Represents a timed mutex type. Use objects of this type to enforce mutual exclusion that has time-limited blocking within a program. Unlike objects of type `timed_mutex`, the effect of calling locking methods for `recursive_timed_mutex` objects is well-defined.|
|[timed_mutex Class](../standard-library/timed-mutex-class.md)|Represents a timed mutex type. Use objects of this type to enforce mutual exclusion that has time-limited blocking within a program.|
|[unique_lock Class](../standard-library/unique-lock-class.md)|Represents a template that can be instantiated to create objects that manage the locking and unlocking of a `mutex`.|

### Functions

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[call_once](../standard-library/mutex-functions.md#call_once)|Provides a mechanism for calling a specified callable object exactly once during execution.|
|[lock](../standard-library/mutex-functions.md#lock)|Attempts to lock all arguments without deadlock.|

### Structs

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[adopt_lock_t Structure](../standard-library/adopt-lock-t-structure.md)|Represents a type that is used to define an `adopt_lock`.|
|[defer_lock_t Structure](../standard-library/defer-lock-t-structure.md)|Represents a type that defines a `defer_lock` object that is used to select one of the overloaded constructors of `unique_lock`.|
|[once_flag Structure](../standard-library/once-flag-structure.md)|Represents a **struct** that is used with the template function `call_once` to ensure that initialization code is called only once, even in the presence of multiple threads of execution.|
|[try_to_lock_t Structure](../standard-library/try-to-lock-t-structure.md)|Represents a **struct** that defines a `try_to_lock` object and is used to select one of the overloaded constructors of `unique_lock`.|

### Variables

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[adopt_lock](../standard-library/mutex-functions.md#adopt_lock)|Represents an object that can be passed to constructors for `lock_guard` and `unique_lock` to indicate that the mutex object that is also being passed to the constructor is locked.|
|[defer_lock](../standard-library/mutex-functions.md#defer_lock)|Represents an object that can be passed to the constructor for `unique_lock`, to indicate that the constructor should not lock the mutex object that is also being passed to it.|
|[try_to_lock](../standard-library/mutex-functions.md#try_to_lock)|Represents an object that can be passed to the constructor for `unique_lock` to indicate that the constructor should try to unlock the `mutex` that is also being passed to it without blocking.|
