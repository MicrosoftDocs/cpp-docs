# Container Class::const_reverse_iterator

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the C++ Standard Library. For more information, see [C++ Standard Library Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).

Describes an object that can serve as a constant reverse iterator for the controlled sequence.

## Syntax

```

typedef T8 const_reverse_iterator;
```

## Remarks

It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type `T8` (typically [reverse_iterator](../standard-library/container-class-reverse-iterator.md) <[const_iterator](../standard-library/container-class-const-iterator.md)`>`).
