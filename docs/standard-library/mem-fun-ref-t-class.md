# mem_fun_ref_t Class
An adapter class that allows a **non_const** member function that takes no arguments to be called as a unary function object when initialized with a reference argument.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
template <class Result, class Type>
class mem_fun_ref_t : public unary_function<Type, Result> {
    explicit mem_fun_ref_t(
    Result (Type::* _Pm)());

    Result operator()(Type& left) const;

 };
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_Pm`  
 A pointer to the member function of class **Type** to be converted to a function object.  
  
 `left`  
 The object that the `_Pm` member function is called on.  
  
## Return Value  
 An adaptable unary function.  
  
## Remarks  
 The template class stores a copy of `_Pm`, which must be a pointer to a member function of class **Type**, in a private member object. It defines its member function `operator()` as returning ( **left**.* `_Pm`)( ).  
  
## Example  
  The constructor of `mem_fun_ref_t` is not usually used directly; the helper function `mem_fun_ref` is used to adapt member functions. See [mem_fun_ref](../standard-library/functional-functions.md#mem_fun_ref_function) for an example of how to use member function adaptors.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** \<functional>  
  
 **Namespace:** std
