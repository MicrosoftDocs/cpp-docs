# indirect_array Class
An internal, auxiliary template class that supports objects that are subsets of valarrays by providing operations between subset arrays defined by specifying a subset of indices of a parent valarray.  
  
## Syntax  
  
  
  
## Remarks  
 The class describes an object that stores a reference to an object **va** of class [valarray](../standard-library/valarray-class.md)**\<Type>**, along with an object **xa** of class **valarray<size_t>**, which describes the sequence of elements to select from the **valarray\<Type>** object.  
  
 You construct an **indirect_array\<Type>** object only by writing an expression of the form **va[xa]**. The member functions of class indirect_array then behave like the corresponding function signatures defined for **valarray\<Type>**, except that only the sequence of selected elements is affected.  
  
 The sequence consists of **xa.**[size](../standard-library/valarray-class.md#valarray__size) elements, where element `I` becomes the index **xa**[ `I`] within **va**.  
  
## Example:  
  
```  
// indirect_array.cpp  
// compile with: /EHsc  
#include <valarray>  
#include <iostream>  
  
int main( )  
{  
   using namespace std;  
   int i;  
  
   valarray<int> va ( 10 );  
   for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i += 2 )  
      va [ i ] =  i;  
   for ( i = 1 ; i < 10 ; i += 2 )  
      va [ i ] =  -1;  
  
   cout << "The initial operand valarray is:  ( ";  
      for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ )  
         cout << va [ i ] << " ";  
   cout << ")." << endl;  
  
   // Select 2nd, 4th & 6th elements  
   // and assign a value of 10 to them  
   valarray<size_t> indx ( 3 );  
   indx [0] = 2;  
   indx [1] = 4;  
   indx [2] = 6;  
   va[indx] = 10;  
  
   cout << "The modified operand valarray is:  ( ";  
      for (i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++ )  
         cout << va [ i ] << " ";  
   cout << ")." << endl;  
}  
```  
  
### Output  
  
```  
The initial operand valarray is:  (0 -1 2 -1 4 -1 6 -1 8 -1).  
The modified operand valarray is:  (0 -1 10 -1 10 -1 10 -1 8 -1).  
```  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** \<valarray>  
  
 **Namespace:** std
