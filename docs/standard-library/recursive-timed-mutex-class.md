# recursive_timed_mutex Class

Represents a *timed mutex type*. Objects of this type are used to enforce mutual exclusion by using time-limited blocking within a program. Unlike objects of type [timed_mutex](../standard-library/timed-mutex-class.md), the effect of calling locking methods for `recursive_timed_mutex` objects is well-defined.

## Syntax

```cpp
class recursive_timed_mutex;
```

## Members

### Public Constructors

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[recursive_timed_mutex](#recursive_timed_mutex)|Constructs a `recursive_timed_mutex` object that's not locked.|
|[~recursive_timed_mutex Destructor](#dtorrecursive_timed_mutex_destructor)|Releases any resources that are used by the `recursive_timed_mutex` object.|

### Public Methods

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[lock](#lock)|Blocks the calling thread until the thread obtains ownership of the `mutex`.|
|[try_lock](#try_lock)|Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` without blocking.|
|[try_lock_for](#try_lock_for)|Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` for a specified time interval.|
|[try_lock_until](#try_lock_until)|Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` until a specified time.|
|[unlock](#unlock)|Releases ownership of the `mutex`.|

## Requirements

**Header:** \<mutex>

**Namespace:** std

## <a name="lock"></a>  lock

Blocks the calling thread until the thread obtains ownership of the `mutex`.

```cpp
void lock();
```

### Remarks

If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the method returns immediately, and the previous lock remains in effect.

## <a name="recursive_timed_mutex"></a>  recursive_timed_mutex Constructor

Constructs a `recursive_timed_mutex` object that is not locked.

```cpp
recursive_timed_mutex();
```

## <a name="dtorrecursive_timed_mutex_destructor"></a>  ~recursive_timed_mutex Destructor

Releases any resources that are used by the `recursive_timed_mutex` object.

```cpp
~recursive_timed_mutex();
```

### Remarks

If the object is locked when the destructor runs, the behavior is undefined.

## <a name="try_lock"></a>  try_lock

Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` without blocking.

```cpp
bool try_lock() noexcept;
```

### Return Value

**true** if the method successfully obtained ownership of the `mutex` or if the calling thread already owns the `mutex`; otherwise, **false**.

### Remarks

If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the function immediately returns **true**, and the previous lock remains in effect.

## <a name="try_lock_for"></a>  try_lock_for

Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` without blocking.

```cpp
template <class Rep, class Period>
bool try_lock_for(const chrono::duration<Rep, Period>& Rel_time);
```

### Parameters

*Rel_time*
 A [chrono::duration](../standard-library/duration-class.md) object that specifies the maximum amount of time that the method attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex`.

### Return Value

**true** if the method successfully obtains ownership of the `mutex` or if the calling thread already owns the `mutex`; otherwise, **false**.

### Remarks

If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the method immediately returns **true**, and the previous lock remains in effect.

## <a name="try_lock_until"></a>  try_lock_until

Attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex` without blocking.

```cpp
template <class Clock, class Duration>
bool try_lock_for(const chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>& Abs_time);

bool try_lock_until(const xtime* Abs_time);
```

### Parameters

*Abs_time*
 A point in time that specifies the threshold after which the method no longer attempts to obtain ownership of the `mutex`.

### Return Value

**true** if the method successfully obtains ownership of the `mutex` or if the calling thread already owns the `mutex`; otherwise, **false**.

### Remarks

If the calling thread already owns the `mutex`, the method immediately returns **true**, and the previous lock remains in effect.

## <a name="unlock"></a>  unlock

Releases ownership of the `mutex`.

```cpp
void unlock();
```

### Remarks

This method releases ownership of the `mutex` only after it is called as many times as [lock](#lock), [try_lock](#try_lock), [try_lock_for](#try_lock_for), and [try_lock_until](#try_lock_until) have been called successfully on the `recursive_timed_mutex` object.

If the calling thread does not own the `mutex`, the behavior is undefined.
