# is_literal_type Class

Tests whether a type can be used as a `constexpr` variable or be constructed, used by, or returned from `constexpr` functions.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class T>
struct is_literal_type;
```

### Parameters

*T*<br/>
The type to query.

## Remarks

An instance of the type predicate holds true if the type *T* is a *literal type*, otherwise it holds false. A literal type is either **void**, a scalar type, a reference type, an array of literal type, or a literal class type. A literal class type is a class type that has a trivial destructor, is either an aggregate type or has at least one non-move, non-copy `constexpr` constructor, and all of its base classes and non-static data members are non-volatile literal types. While the type of a literal is always a literal type, the concept of a literal type includes anything that the compiler can evaluate as a `constexpr` at compile time.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<type_traits>

**Namespace:** std
