# complex Class

The template class describes an object that stores two objects of type `Type`, one that represents the real part of a complex number and one that represents the imaginary part.

## Syntax

```

template <class
Type>
class complex
```

## Remarks

An object of class `Type`:

- Has a public default constructor, destructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator with conventional behavior.

- Can be assigned integer or floating-point values, or type cast to such values with conventional behavior.

- Defines the arithmetic operators and math functions, as needed, that are defined for the floating-point types with conventional behavior.

In particular, no subtle differences may exist between copy construction and default construction followed by assignment. None of the operations on objects of class `Type` may throw exceptions.

Explicit specializations of template class complex exist for the three floating-point types. In this implementation, a value of any other type `Type` is typecast to **double** for actual calculations, with the **double** result assigned back to the stored object of type `Type``.`

### Constructors

|Constructor|Description|
|-|-|
|[complex](#complex)|Constructs a complex number with specified real and imaginary parts or as a copy of some other complex number.|

### Typedefs

|Type name|Description|
|-|-|
|[value_type](#value_type)|A type that represents the data type used to represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.|

### Member functions

|Member function|Description|
|-|-|
|[imag](#imag)|Extracts the imaginary component of a complex number.|
|[real](#real)|Extracts the real component of a complex number.|

### Operators

|Operator|Description|
|-|-|
|[operator*=](#op_star_eq)|Multiplies a target complex number by a factor, which may be complex or be the same type as are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.|
|[operator+=](#op_add_eq)|Adds a number to a target complex number, where the number added may be complex or of the same type as are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number to which it is added.|
|[operator-=](#operator-_eq)|Subtracts a number from a target complex number, where the number subtracted may be complex or of the same type as are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number to which it is added.|
|[operator/=](#op_div_eq)|Divides a target complex number by a divisor, which may be complex or be the same type as are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.|
|[operator=](#op_eq)|Assigns a number to a target complex number, where the number assigned may be complex or of the same type as are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number to which it is being assigned.|

## Requirements

**Header**: \<complex>

**Namespace:** std

## <a name="complex"></a>  complex::complex

Constructs a complex number with specified real and imaginary parts or as a copy of some other complex number.

```cpp
constexpr complex(
    const T&
    _RealVal = 0  ,
    const T&
    _ImagVal = 0);

    template <class Other>
constexpr complex(
    const complex<Other>&
    complexNum);
```

### Parameters

*_RealVal*
 The value of the real part used to initialize the complex number being constructed.

*_ImagVal*
 The value of the imaginary part used to initialize the complex number being constructed.

*complexNum*
 The complex number whose real and imaginary parts are used to initialize the complex number being constructed.

### Remarks

The first constructor initializes the stored real part to _ *RealVal* and the stored imaginary part to \_ *Imagval*. The second constructor initializes the stored real part to `complexNum`**.real**() and the stored imaginary part to `complexNum`**.imag**().

In this implementation, if a translator does not support member template functions, the template:

```cpp
template <class Other>
complex(const complex<Other>& right);
```

is replaced with:

```

complex(const complex& right);
```

which is the copy constructor.

### Example

```cpp
// complex_complex.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   double pi = 3.14159265359;

   // The first constructor specifies real & imaginary parts
   complex <double> c1 ( 4.0 , 5.0 );
   cout << "Specifying initial real & imaginary parts,"
        << "c1 = " << c1 << endl;

   // The second constructor initializes values of the real &
   // imaginary parts using those of another complex number
   complex <double> c2 ( c1 );
   cout << "Initializing with the real and imaginary parts of c1,"
        << " c2 = " << c2 << endl;

   // Complex numbers can be initialized in polar form
   // but will be stored in Cartesian form
   complex <double> c3 ( polar ( sqrt( (double)8 ) , pi / 4 ) );
   cout << "c3 = polar ( sqrt ( 8 ) , pi / 4 ) = " << c3 << endl;

   // The modulus and argument of a complex number can be recovered
   double absc3 = abs ( c3 );
   double argc3 = arg ( c3 );
   cout << "The modulus of c3 is recovered from c3 using: abs ( c3 ) = "
        << absc3 << endl;
   cout << "Argument of c3 is recovered from c3 using:\n arg ( c3 ) = "
        << argc3 << " radians, which is " << argc3 * 180 / pi
        << " degrees." << endl;
}
```

## <a name="imag"></a>  complex::imag

Extracts the imaginary component of a complex number.

```cpp
T imag() const;


T imag(const T& right);
```

### Parameters

*right*
 A complex number whose imaginary value is to be extracted.

### Return Value

The imaginary part of the complex number.

### Remarks

For a complex number *a + bi*, the imaginary part or component is *Im(a + bi) = b.*

### Example

```cpp
// complex_imag.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;

   complex <double> c1 ( 4.0 , 3.0 );
   cout << "The complex number c1 = " << c1 << endl;

   double dr1 = c1.real ( );
   cout << "The real part of c1 is c1.real ( ) = "
        << dr1 << "." << endl;

   double di1 = c1.imag ( );
   cout << "The imaginary part of c1 is c1.imag ( ) = "
        << di1 << "." << endl;
}
```

```Output
The complex number c1 = (4,3)
The real part of c1 is c1.real ( ) = 4.
The imaginary part of c1 is c1.imag ( ) = 3.
```

## <a name="op_star_eq"></a>  complex::operator*=

Multiplies a target complex number by a factor, which may be complex or be the same type as are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

```cpp
template <class Other>
complex& operator*=(const complex<Other>& right);

complex<Type>& operator*=(const Type& right);

complex<Type>& operator*=(const complex<Type>& right);
```

### Parameters

*right*
 A complex number or a number that is of the same type as the parameter of the target complex number.

### Return Value

A complex number that has been multiplied by the number specified as a parameter.

### Remarks

The operation is overloaded so that simple arithmetic operations can be executed without the conversion of the data to a particular format.

### Example

```cpp
// complex_op_me.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
   using namespace std;
   double pi = 3.14159265359;

   cout << "The left-side complex number is cl1 = " << cl1 << endl;
   cout << "The right-side complex number is cr1 = " << cr1 << endl;

   complex <double> cs1 = cl1 * cr1;
   cout << "Quotient of two complex numbers is: cs1 = cl1 * cr1 = "
        << cs1 << endl;

   // This is equivalent to the following operation
   cl1 *= cr1;
   cout << "Quotient of two complex numbers is also: cl1 *= cr1 = "

   cout << "The argument of cl1 is: "<< argcl1 << " radians, which is "
        << argcl1 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;

   // Example of the second member function
   // type complex<double> multiplied by type double
   complex <double> cl2 ( polar ( 3.0 , pi / 6 ) );
   double cr2 = 5.0;

   // This is equivalent to the following operation
   cl2 *= cr2;
   cout << "Quotient of two complex numbers is also: cl2 *= cr2 = "
        << cl2 << endl;

   double abscl2 = abs ( cl2 );
   double argcl2 = arg ( cl2 );
   cout << "The modulus of cl2 is: " << abscl2 << endl;
   cout << "The argument of cl2 is: "<< argcl2 << " radians, which is "
