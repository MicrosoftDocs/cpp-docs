# Container Class::size_type

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the C++ Standard Library. For more information, see [C++ Standard Library Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).

Describes an object that can represent the length of any controlled sequence.

## Syntax

```

typedef T0 size_type;
```

## Remarks

It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type `T0` (typically `Alloc::size_type`).
