# is_trivially_move_assignable Class

Tests whether the type has a trivial move assignment operator.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <class Ty>
struct is_trivially_move_assignable;
```

### Parameters

*Ty*<br/>
The type to query.

## Remarks

An instance of the type predicate holds true if the type *Ty* is a class that has a trivial move assignment operator, otherwise it holds false.

A move assignment operator for a class *Ty* is trivial if:

it is implicitly provided

the class *Ty* has no virtual functions

the class *Ty* has no virtual bases

the classes of all the non-static data members of class type have trivial move assignment operators

the classes of all the non-static data members of type array of class have trivial move assignment operators

## Requirements

**Header:** \<type_traits>

**Namespace:** std
