## <a name="op_neq"></a>  operator!=

Tests for inequality between two complex numbers, one or both of which may belong to the subset of the type for the real and imaginary parts.

```

template <class Type>
bool operator!=(
    const complex<Type>& left,
    const complex<Type>& right);

template <class Type>
bool operator!=(
    const complex<Type>& left,
    const Type& right);

template <class Type>
bool operator!=(
    const Type& left,
    const complex<Type>& right);
```

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
A complex number or object of its parameter type to be tested for inequality.

*right*<br/>
A complex number or object of its parameter type to be tested for inequality.

### Return Value

**true** if the numbers are not equal; **false** if numbers are equal.

### Remarks

Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. Otherwise, they are unequal.

The operation is overloaded so that comparison tests can be executed without the conversion of the data to a particular format.

## <a name="operator-"></a>  operator-

Subtracts two complex numbers, one or both of which may belong to the subset of the type for the real and imaginary parts.

```cpp
template <class Type>
complex<Type> operator-(
    const complex<Type>& left,
    const complex<Type>& right);

template <class Type>
complex<Type> operator-(
    const complex<Type>& left,
    const Type& right);

template <class Type>
complex<Type> operator-(
    const Type& left,
    const complex<Type>& right);

template <class Type>
complex<Type> operator-(const complex<Type>& left);
```

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
The first of two complex numbers or a number that is of the parameter type for a complex number that is to be subtracted by the - operation.

*right*<br/>
The second of two complex numbers or a number that is of the parameter type for a complex number that is to be subtracted by the - operation.

### Return Value

The complex number that results from the subtraction of *right* from *left*, the two numbers whose values are specified by the parameter inputs.

### Remarks

The operation is overloaded so that simple arithmetic operations can be executed without the conversion of the data to a particular format.

The unary operator changes the sign of a complex number and returns a value whose real part is the negative of the real part of the number input and whose imaginary part is the negative of the imaginary part of the number input.

## <a name="op_lt_lt"></a>  operator&lt;&lt;

Inserts a complex number specified into the output stream.

```cpp
template <class Type, class Elem, class Traits>
basic_ostream<Elem, Traits>& operator<<(
    basic_ostream<Elem, Traits>& Ostr,
    const complex<Type>& right);
```

### Parameters

*Ostr*<br/>
The output stream into which the complex number is being entered.

*right*<br/>
The complex number to be entered into the output stream

### Return Value

Writes the value of the specified complex number to the *Ostr* in a Cartesian format: ( *real part, imaginary part* ).

### Remarks

The output stream is overloaded so that it will accept any form of a complex number, and its default output format is the Cartesian format.

### Example

```cpp
// complex_op_insert.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   double pi = 3.14159265359;

   complex <double> c1 ( 3.0, 4.0 );
   cout << "Complex number c1 = " << c1 << endl;

   complex <double> c2  ( polar ( 2.0, pi / 6 ) );
   cout << "Complex number c2 = " << c2 << endl;

   // To display in polar form
   double absc2 = abs ( c2 );
   double argc2 = arg ( c2 );
   cout << "The modulus of c2 is: " << absc2 << endl;
   cout << "The argument of c2 is: "<< argc2 << " radians, which is "
        << argc2 * 180 / pi << " degrees." << endl << endl;
}
```

```Output
Complex number c1 = (3,4)
Complex number c2 = (1.73205,1)
The modulus of c2 is: 2
The argument of c2 is: 0.523599 radians, which is 30 degrees.
```

## <a name="op_eq_eq"></a>  operator==

Tests for equality between two complex numbers, one or both of which may belong to the subset of the type for the real and imaginary parts.

```

template <class Type>
bool operator==(
    const complex<Type>& left,
    const complex<Type>& right);

template <class Type>
bool operator==(
    const complex<Type>& left,
    const Type& right);

template <class Type>
bool operator==(
    const Type& left,
    const complex<Type>& right);
```

### Parameters

*left*<br/>
A complex number or object of its parameter type to be tested for inequality.

*right*<br/>
A complex number or object of its parameter type to be tested for inequality.

### Return Value

**true** if the numbers are equal; **false** if numbers are not equal.

### Remarks

Two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. Otherwise, they are unequal.

The operation is overloaded so that comparison tests can be executed without the conversion of the data to a particular format.

### Example

```cpp
// complex_op_EQ.cpp
// compile with: /EHsc
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main( )
{
   using namespace std;
   double pi = 3.14159265359;
