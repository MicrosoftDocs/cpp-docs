# Container Class::iterator

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is in the Visual C++ documentation as a nonfunctional example of containers used in the C++ Standard Library. For more information, see [C++ Standard Library Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).

Describes an object that can serve as an iterator for the controlled sequence.

## Syntax

```

typedef T5 iterator;
```

## Remarks

It is described here as a synonym for the unspecified type **T5**. An object of type **iterator** can be cast to an object of type [const_iterator](../standard-library/container-class-const-iterator.md).
