Defines the container template class deque and several supporting templates.

## Syntax

```cpp
#include <deque>

```

### Operators

|||
|-|-|
|[operator!=](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#op_neq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is not equal to the deque object on the right side.|
|[operator<](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#op_lt)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is less than the deque object on the right side.|
|[operator\<=](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#op_gt_eq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the deque object on the right side.|
|[operator==](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#op_eq_eq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is equal to the deque object on the right side.|
|[operator>](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#op_gt)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is greater than the deque object on the right side.|
|[operator>=](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#op_gt_eq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the deque object on the right side.|

### Functions

|||
|-|-|
|[swap](../standard-library/deque-functions.md#swap)|Exchanges the elements of two deques.|

### Classes

|||
|-|-|
|[deque Class](../standard-library/deque-class.md)|A template class of sequence containers that arrange elements of a given type in a linear arrangement and, like vectors, allow fast random access to any element and efficient insertion and deletion at the back of the container.|
