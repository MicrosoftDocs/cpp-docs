|[operator\<=](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#op_lt_eq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the deque object on the right side.|
|[operator==](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#op_eq_eq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is equal to the deque object on the right side.|
|[operator>](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#op_gt)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is greater than the deque object on the right side.|
|[operator>=](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#op_gt_eq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the deque object on the right side.|
