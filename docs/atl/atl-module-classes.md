# ATL Module Classes

This topic discusses the module classes that were new in ATL 7.0.

## CComModule Replacement Classes

Earlier versions of ATL used `CComModule`. In ATL 7.0, `CComModule` functionality is replaced by several classes:

- [CAtlBaseModule](../atl/reference/catlbasemodule-class.md) Contains information required by most applications that use ATL. Contains the HINSTANCE of the module and the resource instance.

- [CAtlComModule](../atl/reference/catlcommodule-class.md) Contains information required by the COM classes in ATL.

- [CAtlWinModule](../atl/reference/catlwinmodule-class.md) Contains information required by the windowing classes in ATL.

- [CAtlDebugInterfacesModule](../atl/reference/catldebuginterfacesmodule-class.md) Contains support for interface debugging.

- [CAtlModule](../atl/reference/catlmodule-class.md) The following `CAtlModule`-derived classes are customized to contain information required in a particular application type. Most members in these classes can be overridden:

   - [CAtlDllModuleT](../atl/reference/catldllmodulet-class.md) Used in DLL applications. Provides code for the standard exports.

   - [CAtlExeModuleT](../atl/reference/catlexemodulet-class.md) Used in EXE applications. Provides code required in an EXE.

   - [CAtlServiceModuleT](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md) Provides support to create Windows NT and Windows 2000 Services.

`CComModule` is still available for backward compatibility.

## Reasons for Distributing CComModule Functionality

The functionality of `CComModule` was distributed into several new classes for the following reasons:

- Make the functionality in `CComModule` granular.

     Support for COM, windowing, interface debugging, and application-specific (DLL or EXE) features is now in separate classes.

- Automatically declare global instance of each of these modules.

     A global instance of the required module classes is linked into the project.

- Remove the necessity of calling Init and Term methods.

     Init and Term methods have moved into the constructors and destructors for the module classes; there is no longer a need to call Init and Term.
