# Dual Interfaces and ATL

A dual interface allows its methods to be accessed as dispinterface methods or as vtable methods. This section covers some of the features of dual interfaces from an ATL perspective.

## In This Section

[Implementing a Dual Interface](../atl/implementing-a-dual-interface.md)  
Discusses the classes and wizards involved in implementing a dual interface.

[Multiple Dual Interfaces](../atl/multiple-dual-interfaces.md)  
Discusses how to expose multiple dual interfaces on a single object.

[The nonextensible Attribute](../atl/nonextensible-attribute.md)  
Discusses when to use the **nonextensible** attribute on your interface definition.

[Dual Interfaces and Events](../atl/dual-interfaces-and-events.md)  
Discusses design reasons for not making an event interface a dual interface.

## Related Sections

[ATL](../atl/active-template-library-atl-concepts.md)  
Provides links to conceptual topics on how to program using the Active Template Library.
