# ATL Connection Point Classes

ATL uses the following classes to support connection points:

- [IConnectionPointImpl](../atl/reference/iconnectionpointimpl-class.md) implements a connection point. The IID of the outgoing interface it represents is passed as a template parameter.

- [IConnectionPointContainerImpl](../atl/reference/iconnectionpointcontainerimpl-class.md) implements the connection point container and manages the list of `IConnectionPointImpl` objects.

- [IPropertyNotifySinkCP](../atl/reference/ipropertynotifysinkcp-class.md) implements a connection point representing the [IPropertyNotifySink](/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-ipropertynotifysink) interface.

- [CComDynamicUnkArray](../atl/reference/ccomdynamicunkarray-class.md) manages an arbitrary number of connections between the connection point and its sinks.

- [CComUnkArray](../atl/reference/ccomunkarray-class.md) manages a predefined number of connections as specified by the template parameter.

- [CFirePropNotifyEvent](../atl/reference/cfirepropnotifyevent-class.md) notifies a client's sink that an object's property has changed or is about to change.

- [IDispEventImpl](../atl/reference/idispeventimpl-class.md) provides support for connection points for an ATL COM object. These connection points are mapped with an event sink map, which is provided by your COM object.

- [IDispEventSimpleImpl](../atl/reference/idispeventsimpleimpl-class.md) works in conjunction with the event sink map in your class to route events to the appropriate handler function.
