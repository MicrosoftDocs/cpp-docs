# CAtlServiceModuleT::ServiceMain Function
The service control manager (SCM) calls `ServiceMain` when you open the Services Control Panel application, select the service, and click **Start**.  
  
 After the SCM calls `ServiceMain`, a service must give the SCM a handler function. This function lets the SCM obtain the service's status and pass specific instructions (such as pausing or stopping). The SCM gets this function when the service passes `_Handler` to the Win32 API function, [RegisterServiceCtrlHandler](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms685054). (`_Handler` is a static member function that calls the non-static member function [Handler](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md#handler).)  
  
 At startup, a service should also inform the SCM of its current status. It does this by passing SERVICE_START_PENDING to the Win32 API function, [SetServiceStatus](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686241).  
  
 `ServiceMain` then calls `CAtlExeModuleT::InitializeCom`, which calls the Win32 API function [CoInitializeEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms695279). By default, `InitializeCom` passes the COINIT_MULTITHREADED flag to the function. This flag indicates that the program is to be a free-threaded server.  
  
 Now, `CAtlServiceModuleT::Run` is called to perform the main work of the service. `Run` continues to execute until the service is stopped.
