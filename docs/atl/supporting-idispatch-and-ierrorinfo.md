# Supporting IDispatch and IErrorInfo

You can use the template class [IDispatchImpl](../atl/reference/idispatchimpl-class.md) to provide a default implementation of the `IDispatch Interface` portion of any dual interfaces on your object.

If your object uses the `IErrorInfo` interface to report errors back to the client, then your object must support the `ISupportErrorInfo` interface. The template class [ISupportErrorInfoImpl](../atl/reference/isupporterrorinfoimpl-class.md) provides an easy way to implement this if you only have a single interface that generates errors on your object.
