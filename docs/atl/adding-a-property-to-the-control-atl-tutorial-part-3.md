# Adding a Property to the Control (ATL Tutorial, Part 3)

`IPolyCtl` is the interface that contains the control's custom methods and properties, and you will add a property to it.

### To add a property using the Add Property Wizard

1. In Class View, expand the Polygon branch.

2. Right-click IPolyCtl.

3. On the shortcut menu, click **Add**, and then click **Add Property**.

     The Add Property Wizard will appear.

4. In the drop-down list of property types, select `SHORT`.

5. Type *Sides* as the **Property name.**

6. Click **Finish** to finish adding the property.

When you add the property to the interface, MIDL (the program that compiles .idl files) defines a `Get` method for retrieving its value and a `Put` method for setting a new value. The methods are named by prepending `put_` and `get_` to the property name.

The Add Property Wizard adds the necessary lines to the .idl file. It also adds the `Get` and `Put` function prototypes to the class definition in PolyCtl.h and adds an empty implementation to PolyCtl.cpp. You can check this by opening PolyCtl.cpp and looking for the functions `get_Sides` and `put_Sides`.

Although you now have skeleton functions to set and retrieve the property, it needs a place to be stored. You will create a variable to store the property and update the functions accordingly.

#### To create a variable to store the property, and update the put and get methods

1. From Solution Explorer, open PolyCtl.h and add the following line after the definition of `m_clrFillColor`:

     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Windowing#44](../atl/codesnippet/cpp/adding-a-property-to-the-control-atl-tutorial-part-3_1.h)]

2. Set the default value of `m_nSides`. Make the default shape a triangle by adding a line to the constructor in PolyCtl.h:

     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Windowing#45](../atl/codesnippet/cpp/adding-a-property-to-the-control-atl-tutorial-part-3_2.h)]

3. Implement the `Get` and `Put` methods. The `get_Sides` and `put_Sides` function declarations have been added to PolyCtl.h. Replace the code in PolyCtl.cpp for `get_Sides` and `put_Sides` with the following code:

     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Windowing#46](../atl/codesnippet/cpp/adding-a-property-to-the-control-atl-tutorial-part-3_3.cpp)]

The `get_Sides` method returns the current value of the `Sides` property through the `pVal` pointer. In the `put_Sides` method, the code ensures the user is setting the `Sides` property to an acceptable value. The minimum must be 3, and because an array of points will be used for each side, 100 is a reasonable limit for a maximum value.

You now have a property called `Sides`. In the next step, you will change the drawing code to use it.
