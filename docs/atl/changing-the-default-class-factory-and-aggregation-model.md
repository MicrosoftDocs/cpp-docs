# Changing the Default Class Factory and Aggregation Model
ATL uses [CComCoClass](../atl/reference/ccomcoclass-class.md) to define the default class factory and aggregation model for your object. `CComCoClass` specifies the following two macros:  
  
-   [DECLARE_CLASSFACTORY](reference/aggregation-and-class-factory-macros.md#declare_classfactory) Declares the class factory to be [CComClassFactory](../atl/reference/ccomclassfactory-class.md).  
  
-   [DECLARE_AGGREGATABLE](reference/aggregation-and-class-factory-macros.md#declare_aggregatable) Declares that your object can be aggregated.  
  
 You can override either of these defaults by specifying another macro in your class definition. For example, to use [CComClassFactory2](../atl/reference/ccomclassfactory2-class.md) instead of `CComClassFactory`, specify the [DECLARE_CLASSFACTORY2](reference/aggregation-and-class-factory-macros.md#declare_classfactory2) macro:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_COM#2](../atl/codesnippet/cpp/changing-the-default-class-factory-and-aggregation-model_1.h)]  
  
 Two other macros that define a class factory are [DECLARE_CLASSFACTORY_AUTO_THREAD](reference/aggregation-and-class-factory-macros.md#declare_classfactory_auto_thread) and [DECLARE_CLASSFACTORY_SINGLETON](reference/aggregation-and-class-factory-macros.md#declare_classfactory_singleton).  
  
 ATL also uses the **typedef** mechanism to implement default behavior. For example, the DECLARE_AGGREGATABLE macro uses **typedef** to define a type called `_CreatorClass`, which is then referenced throughout ATL. Note that in a derived class, a **typedef** using the same name as the base class's **typedef** results in ATL using your definition and overriding the default behavior.
