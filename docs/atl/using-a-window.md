# Using a Window
Class [CWindow](../atl/reference/cwindow-class.md) allows you to use a window. Once you attach a window to a `CWindow` object, you can then call `CWindow` methods to manipulate the window. `CWindow` also contains an HWND operator to convert a `CWindow` object to an HWND. Thus you can pass a `CWindow` object to any function that requires a handle to a window. You can easily mix `CWindow` method calls and Win32 function calls, without creating any temporary objects.  
  
 Because `CWindow` has only two data member (a window handle and the default dimensions), it does not impose an overhead on your code. In addition, many of the `CWindow` methods simply wrap corresponding Win32 API functions. By using `CWindow`, the HWND member is automatically passed to the Win32 function.  
  
 In addition to using `CWindow` directly, you can also derive from it to add data or code to your class. ATL itself derives three classes from `CWindow`: [CWindowImpl](../atl/implementing-a-window.md), [CDialogImpl](../atl/implementing-a-dialog-box.md), and [CContainedWindowT](../atl/using-contained-windows.md).
