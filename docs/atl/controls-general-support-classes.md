# Controls: General Support Classes

The following classes provide general support for ATL controls:

- [CComControl](../atl/reference/ccomcontrol-class.md) Consists of helper functions and data members that are essential to ATL controls.

- [IOleControlImpl](../atl/reference/iolecontrolimpl-class.md) Provides methods necessary for controls.

- [IOleObjectImpl](../atl/reference/ioleobjectimpl-class.md) Provides the principal methods through which a container communicates with a control. Manages the activation and deactivation of in-place controls.

- [IQuickActivateImpl](../atl/reference/iquickactivateimpl-class.md) Combines initialization into a single call to help containers avoid delays when loading controls.

- [IPointerInactiveImpl](../atl/reference/ipointerinactiveimpl-class.md) Provides minimal mouse interaction for an otherwise inactive control.
