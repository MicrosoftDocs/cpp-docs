# Composite Controls Classes
The following class provides support for creating composite controls  
  
-   [CComCompositeControl](../atl/reference/ccomcompositecontrol-class.md) ActiveX controls derived from `CComCompositeControl` are hosted by a standard dialog box. These types of controls are called composite controls because they are able to host other controls (native Windows controls and ActiveX controls).
