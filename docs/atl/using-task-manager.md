# Using Task Manager

One of the simplest ways to debug a service is through the use of the Task Manager. While the service is running, start the Task Manager and click the **Processes** tab. Right-click the name of the EXE and then click **Debug**. This launches Visual C++ attached to that running process. Now, click **Break** on the **Debug** menu to allow you to set breakpoints in your code. Click **Run** to run to your selected breakpoints.
