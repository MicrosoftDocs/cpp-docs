# ATL Services

To create your ATL COM object so that it runs in a service, simply select Service (EXE) from the list of server options in the ATL Project Wizard. The wizard will then create a class derived from `CAtlServiceModuleT` to implement the service.

When the ATL COM object is built as a service, it will only be registered as a local server, and it will not appear in the list of services in Control Panel. This is because it is easier to debug the service as a local server than as a service. To install it as a service, run the following at the command prompt:

`YourEXE` `.exe /Service`

To uninstall it, run the following:

`YourEXE` `.exe /UnregServer`

The first four topics in this section discuss the actions that occur during execution of `CAtlServiceModuleT` member functions. These topics appear in the same sequence as the functions are typically called. To improve your understanding of these topics, it is a good idea to use the source code generated by the ATL Project Wizard as a reference. These first four topics are:

- [The CAtlServiceModuleT::Start Function](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md#start)

- [The CAtlServiceModuleT::ServiceMain Function](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md#servicemain)

- [The CAtlServiceModuleT::Run Function](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md#run)

- [The CAtlServiceModuleT::Handler Function](../atl/reference/catlservicemodulet-class.md#handler)

The last three topics discuss concepts related to developing a service:

- [Registry Entries](../atl/registry-entries.md) for ATL services

- [DCOMCNFG](../atl/dcomcnfg.md)

- [Debugging Tips](../atl/debugging-tips.md) for ATL services
