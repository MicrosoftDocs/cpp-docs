# Using Contained Windows
ATL implements contained windows with [CContainedWindowT](../atl/reference/ccontainedwindowt-class.md). A contained window represents a window that delegates its messages to a container object instead of handling them in its own class.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You do not need to derive a class from `CContainedWindowT` in order to use contained windows.  
  
 With contained windows, you can either superclass an existing Windows class or subclass an existing window. To create a window that superclasses an existing Windows class, first specify the existing class name in the constructor for the `CContainedWindowT` object. Then call `CContainedWindowT::Create`. To subclass an existing window, you don't need to specify a Windows class name (pass NULL to the constructor). Simply call the `CContainedWindowT::SubclassWindow` method with the handle to the window being subclassed.  
  
 You typically use contained windows as data members of a container class. The container does not need to be a window; however, it must derive from [CMessageMap](../atl/reference/cmessagemap-class.md).  
  
 A contained window can use alternate message maps to handle its messages. If you have more than one contained window, you should declare several alternate message maps, each corresponding to a separate contained window.  
  
## Example  
 Following is an example of a container class with two contained windows:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Windowing#67](../atl/codesnippet/cpp/using-contained-windows_1.h)]  
  
 For more information about contained windows, see the [SUBEDIT](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2008Samples/ATL/Controls/SubEdit) sample.
