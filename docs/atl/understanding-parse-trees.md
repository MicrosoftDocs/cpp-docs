# Understanding Parse Trees

You can define one or more parse trees in your registrar script, where each parse tree has the following form:

```  
<root key>{<registry expression>}+  
```

where:

```  
<root key> ::= HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT | HKEY_CURRENT_USER |  
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE | HKEY_USERS |  
    HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA | HKEY_DYN_DATA |  
    HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG | HKCR | HKCU |  
    HKLM | HKU | HKPD | HKDD | HKCC  
<registry expression> ::= <Add Key> | <Delete Key>  
<Add Key> ::= [ForceRemove | NoRemove | val]<Key Name> [<Key Value>][{<Add Key>}]  
<Delete Key> ::= Delete<Key Name>  
<Key Name> ::= '<AlphaNumeric>+'  
<AlphaNumeric> ::= any character not NULL, i.e. ASCII 0  
<Key Value> ::== <Key Type><Key Name>  
<Key Type> ::= s | d  
<Key Value> ::= '<AlphaNumeric>'  
```

> [!NOTE]
> `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` and `HKCR` are equivalent; `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` and `HKCU` are equivalent; and so on.

A parse tree can add multiple keys and subkeys to the \<root key>. In doing so, it keeps a subkey's handle open until the parser has completed parsing all of its subkeys. This approach is more efficient than operating on a single key at a time, as seen in the following example:

```  
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT  
{  
    'MyVeryOwnKey'  
    {  
        'HasASubKey'  
        {  
            'PrettyCool'  
        }  
    }  
}  
```

Here, the Registrar initially opens (creates) `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MyVeryOwnKey`. It then sees that `MyVeryOwnKey` has a subkey. Rather than close the key to `MyVeryOwnKey`, the Registrar retains the handle and opens (creates) `HasASubKey` using this parent handle. (The system registry can be slower when no parent handle is open.) Thus, opening `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MyVeryOwnKey` and then opening `HasASubKey` with `MyVeryOwnKey` as the parent is faster than opening `MyVeryOwnKey`, closing `MyVeryOwnKey`, and then opening `MyVeryOwnKey\HasASubKey`.
