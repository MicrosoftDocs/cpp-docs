# File Handling Classes

These classes provide methods for handling files, temporary files, and memory-mapped files.

- [CAtlFile](../atl/reference/catlfile-class.md) This class provides a thin wrapper around the Windows file-handling API.

- [CAtlFileMapping](../atl/reference/catlfilemapping-class.md) This class represents a memory-mapped file, adding a cast operator to the methods of [CAtlFileMappingBase](../atl/reference/catlfilemappingbase-class.md).

- [CAtlFileMappingBase](../atl/reference/catlfilemappingbase-class.md) This class represents a memory-mapped file.

- [CAtlTemporaryFile](../atl/reference/catltemporaryfile-class.md) This class provides methods for the creation and use of a temporary file.
