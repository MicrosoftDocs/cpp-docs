# ATL Support for DHTML Controls

Using ATL, you can create a control with Dynamic HTML (DHTML) capability. An ATL DHTML control:

- Hosts the WebBrowser control.

- Specifies, using HTML, the user interface (UI) of the DHTML control.

- Accesses the WebBrowser object and its methods through its interface, [IWebBrowser2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa752127.aspx).

- Manages communication between C++ code and HTML.

A DHTML control is similar to any other ATL control, except the DHTML control includes an additional dispatch interface. See the figure in [Identifying the Elements of the DHTML Control Project](../atl/identifying-the-elements-of-the-dhtml-control-project.md) for an illustration of the interfaces provided in the default DHTML project.

You can view the ATL DHTML control in a Web browser or other container, such as the ActiveX Control Test Container.
