# Class Factories Classes

The following classes implement or support a class factory:

- [CComClassFactory](../atl/reference/ccomclassfactory-class.md) Provides a default class factory for object creation.

- [CComClassFactory2](../atl/reference/ccomclassfactory2-class.md) Controls object creation through a license.

- [CComClassFactoryAutoThread](../atl/reference/ccomclassfactoryautothread-class.md) Allows objects to be created in multiple thread-pooled apartments.

- [CComClassFactorySingleton](../atl/reference/ccomclassfactorysingleton-class.md) Creates a single object.

- [CComCoClass](../atl/reference/ccomcoclass-class.md) Defines the class factory for the object.
