- [CRect](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) Provides an implementation for storing coordinates of rectangular areas.

- [CSize](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) Provides an implementation for storing distance, relative positions, or paired values.

- [CString](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md) Provides an implementation for storing character strings.

- [CAdapt](../atl/reference/cadapt-class.md) A simple template used to wrap classes that redefine the address-of operator.
