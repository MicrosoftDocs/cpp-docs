# Programming with ATL and C Run-Time Code

This section discusses the benefits of using the C Run-Time Library (CRT) with either static or dynamic linking.

## In This Section

[Benefits and Tradeoffs of the Method Used to Link to the CRT](../atl/benefits-and-tradeoffs-of-the-method-used-to-link-to-the-crt.md)  
Summarizes the benefits and tradeoffs involved in linking statically to the CRT or linking dynamically.

[Linking to the CRT in Your ATL Project](../atl/linking-to-the-crt-in-your-atl-project.md)  
Discusses the project settings and linker options for linking to the CRT; also provides details on how linking to the CRT affects your program image.
