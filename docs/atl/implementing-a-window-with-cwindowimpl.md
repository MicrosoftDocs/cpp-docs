# Implementing a Window with CWindowImpl

To implement a window, derive a class from `CWindowImpl`. In your derived class, declare a message map and the message handler functions. You can now use your class in three different ways:

- [Create a window based on a new Windows class](#_atl_creating_a_window_based_on_a_new_windows_class)

- [Superclass an existing Windows class](#_atl_superclassing_an_existing_windows_class)

- [Subclass an existing window](#_atl_subclassing_an_existing_window)

##  <a name="_atl_creating_a_window_based_on_a_new_windows_class"></a> Creating a Window Based on a New Windows Class

`CWindowImpl` contains the [DECLARE_WND_CLASS](reference/window-class-macros.md#declare_wnd_class) macro to declare Windows class information. This macro implements the `GetWndClassInfo` function, which uses [CWndClassInfo](../atl/reference/cwndclassinfo-class.md) to define the information of a new Windows class. When `CWindowImpl::Create` is called, this Windows class is registered and a new window is created.

> [!NOTE]
>  `CWindowImpl` passes NULL to the `DECLARE_WND_CLASS` macro, which means ATL will generate a Windows class name. To specify your own name, pass a string to DECLARE_WND_CLASS in your `CWindowImpl`-derived class.

## Example

Following is an example of a class that implements a window based on a new Windows class:

[!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Windowing#64](../atl/codesnippet/cpp/implementing-a-window-with-cwindowimpl_1.h)]

To create a window, create an instance of `CMyWindow` and then call the `Create` method.

> [!NOTE]
>  To override the default Windows class information, implement the `GetWndClassInfo` method in your derived class by setting the `CWndClassInfo` members to the appropriate values.

##  <a name="_atl_superclassing_an_existing_windows_class"></a> Superclassing an Existing Windows Class

The [DECLARE_WND_SUPERCLASS](reference/window-class-macros.md#declare_wnd_superclass) macro allows you to create a window that superclasses an existing Windows class. Specify this macro in your `CWindowImpl`-derived class. Like any other ATL window, messages are handled by a message map.

When you use DECLARE_WND_SUPERCLASS, a new Windows class will be registered. This new class will be the same as the existing class you specify, but will replace the window procedure with `CWindowImpl::WindowProc` (or with your function that overrides this method).

## Example

Following is an example of a class that superclasses the standard Edit class:

[!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Windowing#65](../atl/codesnippet/cpp/implementing-a-window-with-cwindowimpl_2.h)]

To create the superclassed Edit window, create an instance of `CMyEdit` and then call the `Create` method.

##  <a name="_atl_subclassing_an_existing_window"></a> Subclassing an Existing Window

To subclass an existing window, derive a class from `CWindowImpl` and declare a message map, as in the two previous cases. Note, however, that you do not specify any Windows class information, since you will subclass an already existing window.

Instead of calling `Create`, call `SubclassWindow` and pass it the handle to the existing window you want to subclass. Once the window is subclassed, it will use `CWindowImpl::WindowProc` (or your function that overrides this method) to direct messages to the message map. To detach a subclassed window from your object, call `UnsubclassWindow`. The window's original window procedure will then be restored.
