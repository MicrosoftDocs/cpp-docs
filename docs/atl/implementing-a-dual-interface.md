# Implementing a Dual Interface

You can implement a dual interface using the [IDispatchImpl](../atl/reference/idispatchimpl-class.md) class, which provides a default implementation of the `IDispatch` methods in a dual interface. For more information, see [Implementing the IDispatch Interface](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/automat/implementing-the-idispatch-interface).

To use this class:

- Define your dual interface in a type library.

- Derive your class from a specialization of `IDispatchImpl` (pass information about the interface and type library as the template arguments).

- Add an entry (or entries) to the COM map to expose the dual interface through `QueryInterface`.

- Implement the vtable part of the interface in your class.

- Ensure that the type library containing the interface definition is available to your objects at run time.

## ATL Simple Object Wizard

If you want to create a new interface and a new class to implement it, you can use the [ATL Add Class dialog box](../ide/add-class-dialog-box.md), and then the [ATL Simple Object Wizard](../atl/reference/atl-simple-object-wizard.md).

## Implement Interface Wizard

If you have an existing interface, you can use the [Implement Interface Wizard](../atl/reference/adding-a-new-interface-in-an-atl-project.md) to add the necessary base class, COM map entries, and skeleton method implementations to an existing class.

> [!NOTE]
>  You may need to adjust the generated base class so that the major and minor version numbers of the type library are passed as template arguments to your `IDispatchImpl` base class. The Implement Interface Wizard doesn't check the type library version number for you.

## Implementing IDispatch

You can use an `IDispatchImpl` base class to provide an implementation of a dispinterface just by specifying the appropriate entry in the COM map (using the [COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY2](reference/com-interface-entry-macros.md#com_interface_entry2) or [COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY_IID](reference/com-interface-entry-macros.md#com_interface_entry_iid) macro) as long as you have a type library describing a corresponding dual interface. It is quite common to implement the `IDispatch` interface this way, for example. The ATL Simple Object Wizard and Implement Interface Wizard both assume that you intend to implement `IDispatch` in this way, so they will add the appropriate entry to the map.

> [!NOTE]
>  ATL offers the [IDispEventImpl](../atl/reference/idispeventimpl-class.md) and [IDispEventSimpleImpl](../atl/reference/idispeventsimpleimpl-class.md) classes to help you implement dispinterfaces without requiring a type library containing the definition of a compatible dual interface.
