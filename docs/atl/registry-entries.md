# Registry Entries

DCOM introduced the concept of Application IDs (AppIDs), which group configuration options for one or more DCOM objects into a centralized location in the registry. You specify an AppID by indicating its value in the AppID named value under the object's CLSID.

By default, an ATL-generated service uses its CLSID as the GUID for its AppID. Under `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID`, you can specify DCOM-specific entries. Initially, two entries exist:

- `LocalService`, with a value equal to the name of the service. If this value exists, it is used instead of the `LocalServer32` key under the CLSID.

- `ServiceParameters`, with a value equal to `-Service`. This value specifies parameters that will be passed to the service when it is started. Note that these parameters are passed to the service's `ServiceMain` function, not `WinMain`.

Any DCOM service also needs to create another key under `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID`. This key is equal to the name of the EXE and acts as a cross-reference, as it contains an AppID value pointing back to the AppID entries.
