# Creating an Aggregated Object

Aggregation delegates `IUnknown` calls, providing a pointer to the outer object's `IUnknown` to the inner object.

### To create an aggregated object

1. Add an `IUnknown` pointer to your class object and initialize it to NULL in the constructor.

2. Override [FinalConstruct](../atl/reference/ccomobjectrootex-class.md#finalconstruct) to create the aggregate.

3. Use the `IUnknown` pointer, defined in Step 1, as the second parameter for the [COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY_AGGREGATE](reference/com-interface-entry-macros.md#com_interface_entry_aggregate) macros.

4. Override [FinalRelease](../atl/reference/ccomobjectrootex-class.md#finalrelease) to release the `IUnknown` pointer.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you use and release an interface from the aggregated object during `FinalConstruct`, you should add the [DECLARE_PROTECT_FINAL_CONSTRUCT](reference/aggregation-and-class-factory-macros.md#declare_protect_final_construct) macro to the definition of your class object.
