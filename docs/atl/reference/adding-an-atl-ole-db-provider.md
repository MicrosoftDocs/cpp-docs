# Adding an ATL OLE DB Provider

Use this wizard to add an ATL OLE DB provider to a project. An ATL OLE DB provider consists of a data source, session, command, and rowset classes. The project must have been created as an ATL COM application.

### To add an ATL OLE DB provider to your project

1. In Class View, right-click the project. On the shortcut menu, click **Add** and then click **Add Class**.

2. In the Visual C++ folder, double-click the **ATL OLE DB Provider** icon or select it and click **Open**.

     The ATL OLE DB Provider Wizard opens.

3. Define settings as described in [ATL OLE DB Provider Wizard](../../atl/reference/atl-ole-db-provider-wizard.md).

4. Click **Finish** to close the wizard, which will insert the newly created OLE DB provider code in your project.
