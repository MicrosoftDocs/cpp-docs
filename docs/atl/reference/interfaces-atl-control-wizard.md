# Interfaces, ATL Control Wizard

This page of the wizard identifies the interfaces that the control supports. By default, the supported interfaces are those typically used by most containers.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you selected **Minimal control** on the [Options](../../atl/reference/options-atl-control-wizard.md) tab, no interfaces appear by default in the **Supported** list box.

**Not supported**  
Indicates the available interfaces that are not currently supported for the control.

**Supported**
