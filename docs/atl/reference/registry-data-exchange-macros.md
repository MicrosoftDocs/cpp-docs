# Registry Data Exchange Macros
These macros perform Registry Data Exchange operations.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[BEGIN_RDX_MAP](#begin_rdx_map)|Marks the beginning of the Registry Data Exchange map.|  
|[END_RDX_MAP](#end_rdx_map)|Marks the end of the Registry Data Exchange map.|  
|[RDX_BINARY](#rdx_binary)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type BYTE.|  
|[RDX_CSTRING_TEXT](#rdx_cstring_text)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type CString.|  
|[RDX_DWORD](#rdx_dword)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type DWORD.|  
|[RDX_TEXT](#rdx_text)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type TCHAR.|  

## Requirements  
 **Header:** atlplus.h  
   
##  <a name="begin_rdx_map"></a>  BEGIN_RDX_MAP  
 Marks the beginning of the Registry Data Exchange map.  
  
```
BEGIN_RDX_MAP
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The following macros are used within the Registry Data Exchange map to read and write entries in the system registry:  
  
|Macro|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[RDX_BINARY](#rdx_binary)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type BYTE.|  
|[RDX_DWORD](#rdx_dword)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type DWORD.|  
|[RDX_CSTRING_TEXT](#rdx_cstring_text)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type CString.|  
|[RDX_TEXT](#rdx_text)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type TCHAR.|  
  
 The global function [RegistryDataExchange](../../atl/reference/registry-and-typelib-global-functions.md#registrydataexchange), or the member function of the same name created by the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros, should be used whenever your code needs to exchange data between the system registry and the variables specified in the RDX map.  
  
##  <a name="end_rdx_map"></a>  END_RDX_MAP  
 Marks the end of the Registry Data Exchange map.  
  
```
END_RDX_MAP
```  
  
##  <a name="rdx_binary"></a>  RDX_BINARY  
 Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type BYTE.  
  
```
RDX_BINARY(
    rootkey, 
    subkey, 
    valuename, 
    member, 
    member_size )
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *rootkey*  
 The registry key root.  
  
 *subkey*  
 The registry subkey.  
  
 *valuename*  
 The registry key.  
  
 *member*  
 The member variable to associate with the specified registry entry.  
  
 *member_size*  
 The size, in bytes, of the member variable.  
  
### Remarks  
 This macro is used in conjunction with the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros to associate a member variable with a given registry entry. The global function [RegistryDataExchange](../../atl/reference/registry-and-typelib-global-functions.md#registrydataexchange), or the member function of the same name created by the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros, should be used to perform exchange of data between the system registry and the member variables in the RDX map.  
  
##  <a name="rdx_cstring_text"></a>  RDX_CSTRING_TEXT  
 Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type CString.  
  
```
RDX_CSTRING_TEXT(
    rootkey, 
    subkey, 
    valuename, 
    member, 
    member_size )
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *rootkey*  
 The registry key root.  
  
 *subkey*  
 The registry subkey.  
  
 *valuename*  
 The registry key.  
  
 *member*  
 The member variable to associate with the specified registry entry.  
  
 *member_size*  
 The size, in bytes, of the member variable.  
  
### Remarks  
 This macro is used in conjunction with the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros to associate a member variable with a given registry entry. The global function [RegistryDataExchange](../../atl/reference/registry-and-typelib-global-functions.md#registrydataexchange), or the member function of the same name created by the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros, should be used to perform exchange of data between the system registry and the member variables in the RDX map.  
  
##  <a name="rdx_dword"></a>  RDX_DWORD  
 Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type DWORD.  
  
```
RDX_DWORD(
    rootkey, 
    subkey, 
    valuename, 
    member, 
    member_size )
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *rootkey*  
 The registry key root.  
  
 *subkey*  
 The registry subkey.  
  
 *valuename*  
 The registry key.  
  
 *member*  
 The member variable to associate with the specified registry entry.  
  
 *member_size*  
 The size, in bytes, of the member variable.  
  
### Remarks  
 This macro is used in conjunction with the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros to associate a member variable with a given registry entry. The global function [RegistryDataExchange](../../atl/reference/registry-and-typelib-global-functions.md#registrydataexchange), or the member function of the same name created by the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros, should be used to perform exchange of data between the system registry and the member variables in the RDX map.  
  
##  <a name="rdx_text"></a>  RDX_TEXT  
 Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type TCHAR.  
  
```
RDX_TEXT(
    rootkey, 
    subkey, 
    valuename, 
    member, 
    member_size )
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *rootkey*  
 The registry key root.  
  
 *subkey*  
 The registry subkey.  
  
 *valuename*  
 The registry key.  
  
 *member*  
 The member variable to associate with the specified registry entry.  
  
 *member_size*  
 The size, in bytes, of the member variable.  
  
### Remarks  
 This macro is used in conjunction with the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros to associate a member variable with a given registry entry. The global function [RegistryDataExchange](../../atl/reference/registry-and-typelib-global-functions.md#registrydataexchange), or the member function of the same name created by the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros, should be used to perform exchange of data between the system registry and the member variables in the RDX map.
