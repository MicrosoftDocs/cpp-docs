# Registry Data Exchange Macros

These macros perform Registry Data Exchange operations.

|||
|-|-|
|[BEGIN_RDX_MAP](#begin_rdx_map)|Marks the beginning of the Registry Data Exchange map.|
|[END_RDX_MAP](#end_rdx_map)|Marks the end of the Registry Data Exchange map.|
|[RDX_BINARY](#rdx_binary)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type BYTE.|
|[RDX_CSTRING_TEXT](#rdx_cstring_text)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type CString.|
|[RDX_DWORD](#rdx_dword)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type DWORD.|
|[RDX_TEXT](#rdx_text)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type TCHAR.|

## Requirements

**Header:** atlplus.h

##  <a name="begin_rdx_map"></a>  BEGIN_RDX_MAP

Marks the beginning of the Registry Data Exchange map.

```
BEGIN_RDX_MAP
```

### Remarks

The following macros are used within the Registry Data Exchange map to read and write entries in the system registry:

|Macro|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|[RDX_BINARY](#rdx_binary)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type BYTE.|
|[RDX_DWORD](#rdx_dword)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type DWORD.|
|[RDX_CSTRING_TEXT](#rdx_cstring_text)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type CString.|
|[RDX_TEXT](#rdx_text)|Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type TCHAR.|

The global function [RegistryDataExchange](../../atl/reference/registry-and-typelib-global-functions.md#registrydataexchange), or the member function of the same name created by the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros, should be used whenever your code needs to exchange data between the system registry and the variables specified in the RDX map.

##  <a name="end_rdx_map"></a>  END_RDX_MAP

Marks the end of the Registry Data Exchange map.

```
END_RDX_MAP
```

##  <a name="rdx_binary"></a>  RDX_BINARY

Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type BYTE.

```
RDX_BINARY(
    rootkey,
    subkey,
    valuename,
    member,
    member_size )
```

### Parameters

*rootkey*<br/>
The registry key root.

*subkey*<br/>
The registry subkey.

*valuename*<br/>
The registry key.

*member*<br/>
The member variable to associate with the specified registry entry.

*member_size*<br/>
The size, in bytes, of the member variable.

### Remarks

This macro is used in conjunction with the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros to associate a member variable with a given registry entry. The global function [RegistryDataExchange](../../atl/reference/registry-and-typelib-global-functions.md#registrydataexchange), or the member function of the same name created by the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros, should be used to perform exchange of data between the system registry and the member variables in the RDX map.

##  <a name="rdx_cstring_text"></a>  RDX_CSTRING_TEXT

Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type CString.

```
RDX_CSTRING_TEXT(
    rootkey,
    subkey,
    valuename,
    member,
    member_size )
```

### Parameters

*rootkey*<br/>
The registry key root.

*subkey*<br/>
The registry subkey.

*valuename*<br/>
The registry key.

*member*<br/>
The member variable to associate with the specified registry entry.

*member_size*<br/>
The size, in bytes, of the member variable.

### Remarks

This macro is used in conjunction with the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros to associate a member variable with a given registry entry. The global function [RegistryDataExchange](../../atl/reference/registry-and-typelib-global-functions.md#registrydataexchange), or the member function of the same name created by the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros, should be used to perform exchange of data between the system registry and the member variables in the RDX map.

##  <a name="rdx_dword"></a>  RDX_DWORD

Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type DWORD.

```
RDX_DWORD(
    rootkey,
    subkey,
    valuename,
    member,
    member_size )
```

### Parameters

*rootkey*<br/>
The registry key root.

*subkey*<br/>
The registry subkey.

*valuename*<br/>
The registry key.

*member*<br/>
The member variable to associate with the specified registry entry.

*member_size*<br/>
The size, in bytes, of the member variable.

### Remarks

This macro is used in conjunction with the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros to associate a member variable with a given registry entry. The global function [RegistryDataExchange](../../atl/reference/registry-and-typelib-global-functions.md#registrydataexchange), or the member function of the same name created by the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros, should be used to perform exchange of data between the system registry and the member variables in the RDX map.

##  <a name="rdx_text"></a>  RDX_TEXT

Associates the specified registry entry with a specified member variable of type TCHAR.

```
RDX_TEXT(
    rootkey,
    subkey,
    valuename,
    member,
    member_size )
```

### Parameters

*rootkey*<br/>
The registry key root.

*subkey*<br/>
The registry subkey.

*valuename*<br/>
The registry key.

*member*<br/>
The member variable to associate with the specified registry entry.

*member_size*<br/>
The size, in bytes, of the member variable.

### Remarks

This macro is used in conjunction with the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros to associate a member variable with a given registry entry. The global function [RegistryDataExchange](../../atl/reference/registry-and-typelib-global-functions.md#registrydataexchange), or the member function of the same name created by the BEGIN_RDX_MAP and END_RDX_MAP macros, should be used to perform exchange of data between the system registry and the member variables in the RDX map.
