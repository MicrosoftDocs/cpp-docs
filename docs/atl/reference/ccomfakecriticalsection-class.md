# CComFakeCriticalSection Class

This class provides the same methods as [CComCriticalSection](../../atl/reference/ccomcriticalsection-class.md) but does not provide a critical section.

## Syntax

```
class CComFakeCriticalSection
```

## Members

### Public Methods

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[CComFakeCriticalSection::Init](#init)|Does nothing since there is no critical section.|
|[CComFakeCriticalSection::Lock](#lock)|Does nothing since there is no critical section.|
|[CComFakeCriticalSection::Term](#term)|Does nothing since there is no critical section.|
|[CComFakeCriticalSection::Unlock](#unlock)|Does nothing since there is no critical section.|

## Remarks

`CComFakeCriticalSection` mirrors the methods found in [CComCriticalSection](../../atl/reference/ccomcriticalsection-class.md). However, `CComFakeCriticalSection` does not provide a critical section; therefore, its methods do nothing.

Typically, you use `CComFakeCriticalSection` through a `typedef` name, either `AutoCriticalSection` or `CriticalSection`. When using [CComSingleThreadModel](../../atl/reference/ccomsinglethreadmodel-class.md) or [CComMultiThreadModelNoCS](../../atl/reference/ccommultithreadmodelnocs-class.md), both of these `typedef` names reference `CComFakeCriticalSection`. When using [CComMultiThreadModel](../../atl/reference/ccommultithreadmodel-class.md), they reference [CComAutoCriticalSection](../../atl/reference/ccomautocriticalsection-class.md) and `CComCriticalSection`, respectively.
