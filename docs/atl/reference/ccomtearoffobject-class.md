# CComTearOffObject Class

This class implements a tear-off interface.

## Syntax

```
template<class Base>
class CComTearOffObject : public Base
```

#### Parameters

*Base*  
Your tear-off class, derived from `CComTearOffObjectBase` and the interfaces you want your tear-off object to support.

ATL implements its tear-off interfaces in two phases â€” the `CComTearOffObjectBase` methods handle the reference count and `QueryInterface`, while `CComTearOffObject` implements [IUnknown](/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown).

## Members

### Public Constructors

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[CComTearOffObject::CComTearOffObject](#ccomtearoffobject)|The constructor.|
|[CComTearOffObject::~CComTearOffObject](#dtor)|The destructor.|

### Public Methods

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[CComTearOffObject::AddRef](#addref)|Increments the reference count for a `CComTearOffObject` object.|
|[CComTearOffObject::QueryInterface](#queryinterface)|Returns a pointer to the requested interface on either your tear-off class or the owner class.|
|[CComTearOffObject::Release](#release)|Decrements the reference count for a `CComTearOffObject` object and destroys it.|

### CComTearOffObjectBase Methods

|-|-|
|[CComTearOffObjectBase](#ccomtearoffobjectbase)|Constructor.|

### CComTearOffObjectBase Data Members

|||
|-|-|
|[m_pOwner](#m_powner)|A pointer to a `CComObject` derived from the owner class.|

## Remarks

`CComTearOffObject` implements a tear-off interface as a separate object that is instantiated only when that interface is queried for. The tear-off is deleted when its reference count becomes zero. Typically, you build a tear-off interface for an interface that is rarely used, since using a tear-off saves a vtable pointer in all the instances of your main object.

You should derive the class implementing the tear-off from `CComTearOffObjectBase` and from whichever interfaces you want your tear-off object to support. `CComTearOffObjectBase` is templatized on the owner class and the thread model. The owner class is the class of the object for which a tear-off is being implemented. If you do not specify a thread model, the default thread model is used.

You should create a COM map for your tear-off class. When ATL instantiates the tear-off, it will create `CComTearOffObject<CYourTearOffClass>` or `CComCachedTearOffObject<CYourTearOffClass>`.

For example, in the BEEPER sample, the `CBeeper2` class is the tear-off class and the `CBeeper` class is the owner class:

[!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_COM#43](../../atl/codesnippet/cpp/ccomtearoffobject-class_1.h)]

## Inheritance Hierarchy

`Base`

`CComTearOffObject`

## Requirements

**Header:** atlcom.h

##  <a name="addref"></a>  CComTearOffObject::AddRef

Increments the reference count of the `CComTearOffObject` object by one.

```
STDMETHOD_(ULONG, AddRef)();
```

### Return Value

A value that may be useful for diagnostics and testing.

##  <a name="ccomtearoffobject"></a>  CComTearOffObject::CComTearOffObject

The constructor.

```
CComTearOffObject(void* pv);
```

### Parameters

*pv*  
[in] Pointer that will be converted to a pointer to a `CComObject<Owner>` object.

### Remarks

Increments the owner's reference count by one.

##  <a name="dtor"></a>  CComTearOffObject::~CComTearOffObject

The destructor.

```
~CComTearOffObject();
```

### Remarks

Frees all allocated resources, calls FinalRelease, and decrements the module lock count.

##  <a name="ccomtearoffobjectbase"></a>  CComTearOffObject::CComTearOffObjectBase

The constructor.

```
CComTearOffObjectBase();
```

### Remarks

Initializes the [m_pOwner](#m_powner) member to NULL.

##  <a name="m_powner"></a>  CComTearOffObject::m_pOwner

A pointer to a [CComObject](../../atl/reference/ccomobject-class.md) object derived from *Owner*.

```
CComObject<Owner>* m_pOwner;
```

### Parameters

*Owner*  
[in] The class for which a tear-off is being implemented.

### Remarks

The pointer is initialized to NULL during construction.

##  <a name="queryinterface"></a>  CComTearOffObject::QueryInterface

Retrieves a pointer to the requested interface.

```
STDMETHOD(QueryInterface)(REFIID iid, void** ppvObject);
```

### Parameters

*iid*  
[in] The IID of the interface being requested.

*ppvObject*  
[out] A pointer to the interface pointer identified by *iid*, or NULL if the interface is not found.

### Return Value

A standard HRESULT value.

### Remarks

Queries first for interfaces on your tear-off class. If the interface is not there, queries for the interface on the owner object. If the requested interface is `IUnknown`, returns the `IUnknown` of the owner.

##  <a name="release"></a>  CComTearOffObject::Release

Decrements the reference count by one and, if the reference count is zero, deletes the `CComTearOffObject`.

```
STDMETHOD_ULONG Release();
```

### Return Value

In non-debug builds, always returns zero. In debug builds, returns a value that may be useful for diagnostics or testing.
