# Worker Archetype
Classes that conform to the *worker* archetype provide the code to process work items queued on a thread pool.  
  
 **Implementation**  
  
 To implement a class conforming to this archetype, the class must provide the following features:  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[Initialize](#initialize)|Called to initialize the worker object before any requests are passed to [Execute](#execute).|  
|[Execute](#execute)|Called to process a work item.|  
|[Terminate](#terminate)|Called to uninitialize the worker object after all requests have been passed to [Execute](#execute).|  
  
|Typedef|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[RequestType](#requesttype)|A typedef for the type of work item that can be processed by the worker class.|  
  
 A typical *worker* class looks like this:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATL_Utilities#137](../../atl/codesnippet/cpp/worker-archetype_1.cpp)]  
  
 **Existing Implementations**  
  
 These classes conform to this archetype:  
  
|Class|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[CNonStatelessWorker](../../atl/reference/cnonstatelessworker-class.md)|Receives requests from the thread pool and passes them on to a worker object that is created and destroyed for each request.|  
  
 **Use**  
  
 These template parameters expect the class to conform to this archetype:  
  
|Parameter name|Used by|  
|--------------------|-------------|  
|*Worker*|[CThreadPool](../../atl/reference/cthreadpool-class.md)|  
|*Worker*|[CNonStatelessWorker](../../atl/reference/cnonstatelessworker-class.md)|  
  
### Requirements  
 **Header:** atlutil.h  
  
## <a name="execute"></a>WorkerArchetype::Execute
Called to process a work item.  
  
  
  
```  
void Execute(
    RequestType request,  
    void* pvWorkerParam,  
    OVERLAPPED* pOverlapped);
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *request*  
 The work item to be processed. The work item is of the same type as `RequestType`.  
  
 *pvWorkerParam*  
 A custom parameter understood by the worker class. Also passed to `WorkerArchetype::Initialize` and `Terminate`.  
  
 *pOverlapped*  
 A pointer to the [OVERLAPPED](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms684342) structure used to create the queue on which work items were queued.  
  
## <a name="initialize"></a> WorkerArchetype::Initialize
Called to initialize the worker object before any requests are passed to `WorkerArchetype::Execute`.  
```
BOOL Initialize(void* pvParam) throw();
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *pvParam*  
 A custom parameter understood by the worker class. Also passed to `WorkerArchetype::Terminate` and `WorkerArchetype::Execute`.  
  
### Return Value  
 Return TRUE on success, FALSE on failure.  
  
## <a name="requesttype"></a> WorkerArchetype::RequestType
A typedef for the type of work item that can be processed by the worker class.  
  
```  
typedef MyRequestType RequestType;    
```  
  
### Remarks  
 This type must be used as the first parameter of `WorkerArchetype::Execute` and must be capable of being cast to and from a ULONG_PTR.  
  
## <a name="terminate"></a> WorkerArchetype::Terminate
Called to uninitialize the worker object after all requests have been passed to `WorkerArchetype::Execute`).  
    
``` 
void Terminate(void* pvParam) throw();
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *pvParam*  
 A custom parameter understood by the worker class. Also passed to `WorkerArchetype::Initialize` and `WorkerArchetype::Execute`.
