## Remarks

This class provides methods for creating and managing ATL controls. [CComControl Class](../../atl/reference/ccomcontrol-class.md) derives from `CComControlBase`. When you create a Standard Control or DHTML control using the ATL Control Wizard, the wizard will automatically derive your class from `CComControlBase`.

For more information about creating a control, see the [ATL Tutorial](../../atl/active-template-library-atl-tutorial.md). For more information about the ATL Project Wizard, see the article [Creating an ATL Project](../../atl/reference/creating-an-atl-project.md).

## Requirements

**Header:** atlctl.h

##  <a name="appearancetype"></a>  CComControlBase::AppearanceType

Override if your `m_nAppearance` stock property isn't of type **short**.

```
typedef short AppearanceType;
```

### Remarks

The ATL Control Wizard adds `m_nAppearance` stock property of type short. Override `AppearanceType` if you use a different data type.

##  <a name="dtor"></a>  CComControlBase::~CComControlBase

The destructor.

```
~CComControlBase();
```

### Remarks

If the control is windowed, `~CComControlBase` destroys it by calling [DestroyWindow](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-destroywindow).

##  <a name="controlqueryinterface"></a>  CComControlBase::ControlQueryInterface

### Remarks

`SendOnViewChange` calls [IAdviseSink::OnViewChange](/windows/desktop/api/objidl/nf-objidl-iadvisesink-onviewchange). The only value of *lindex* currently supported is -1, which indicates that the entire view is of interest.

##  <a name="setcontrolfocus"></a>  CComControlBase::SetControlFocus

Sets or removes the keyboard focus to or from the control.

BOOL SetControlFocus(BOOL bGrab);
```

### Parameters

*bGrab*  
If TRUE, sets the keyboard focus to the calling control. If FALSE, removes the keyboard focus from the calling control, provided it has the focus.

### Return Value

Returns TRUE if the control successfully receives focus; otherwise, FALSE.

### Remarks

For a windowed control, the Windows API function [SetFocus](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646312) is called. For a windowless control, [IOleInPlaceSiteWindowless::SetFocus](/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-ioleinplacesitewindowless-setfocus) is called. Through this call, a windowless control obtains the keyboard focus and can respond to window messages.

### Remarks

`SetDirty(TRUE)` should be called to flag that the control has changed since it was last saved. The value of `m_bRequiresSave` is retrieved with [CComControlBase::GetDirty](#getdirty).
