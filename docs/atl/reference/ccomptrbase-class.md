## Remarks  
 This class provides the basis for other smart pointers which use COM memory management routines, such as [CComQIPtr](../../atl/reference/ccomqiptr-class.md) and [CComPtr](../../atl/reference/ccomptr-class.md). The derived classes add their own constructors and operators, but rely on the methods provided by `CComPtrBase`.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** atlcomcli.h  
  
##  <a name="advise"></a>  CComPtrBase::Advise  
 Call this method to create a connection between the `CComPtrBase`'s connection point and a client's sink.  
  
```
HRESULT Advise(
    IUnknown* pUnk,
    const IID& iid,
    LPDWORD pdw) throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pUnk*  
 A pointer to the client's `IUnknown`.  
  
 *iid*  
 The GUID of the connection point. Typically, this is the same as the outgoing interface managed by the connection point.  
  
 *pdw*  
 A pointer to the cookie that uniquely identifies the connection.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 See [AtlAdvise](connection-point-global-functions.md#atladvise) for more information.  
  
##  <a name="attach"></a>  CComPtrBase::Attach  
 Call this method to take ownership of an existing pointer.  
  
```
void Attach(T* p2) throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *p2*  
 The `CComPtrBase` object will take ownership of this pointer.  
  
### Remarks  
 `Attach` calls [CComPtrBase::Release](#release) on the existing [CComPtrBase::p](#p) member variable and then assigns *p2* to `CComPtrBase::p`. When a `CComPtrBase` object takes ownership of a pointer, it will automatically call `Release` on the pointer which will delete the pointer and any allocated data if the reference count on the object goes to 0.  
  
##  <a name="dtor"></a>  CComPtrBase::~CComPtrBase  
 The destructor.  
  
```
~CComPtrBase() throw();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Releases the interface pointed to by `CComPtrBase`.  
  
##  <a name="cocreateinstance"></a>  CComPtrBase::CoCreateInstance  
 Call this method to create an object of the class associated with a specified Class ID or Program ID.  
  
```
HRESULT CoCreateInstance(  
    LPCOLESTR szProgID,
    LPUNKNOWN pUnkOuter = NULL,
    DWORD dwClsContext = CLSCTX_ALL) throw();

HRESULT CoCreateInstance(  
    REFCLSID rclsid,
    LPUNKNOWN pUnkOuter = NULL,
    DWORD dwClsContext = CLSCTX_ALL) throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *szProgID*  
 Pointer to a ProgID, used to recover the CLSID.  
  
 *pUnkOuter*  
 If NULL, indicates that the object is not being created as part of an aggregate. If non- NULL, is a pointer to the aggregate object's `IUnknown` interface (the controlling `IUnknown`).  
  
 *dwClsContext*  
 Context in which the code that manages the newly created object will run.  
  
 *rclsid*  
 CLSID associated with the data and code that will be used to create the object.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, or REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG, CLASS_E_NOAGGREGATION, CO_E_CLASSSTRING or E_NOINTERFACE on failure. See [CoCreateClassInstance](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686615) and [CLSIDFromProgID](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms688386) for a description of these errors.  
  
### Remarks  
 If the first form of the method is called, [CLSIDFromProgID](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms688386) is used to recover the CLSID. Both forms then call [CoCreateClassInstance](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686615).  
  
 In debug builds, an assertion error will occur if [CComPtrBase::p](#p) is not equal to NULL.  
  
##  <a name="copyto"></a>  CComPtrBase::CopyTo  
 Call this method to copy the `CComPtrBase` pointer to another pointer variable.  
  
```
HRESULT CopyTo(T** ppT) throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *ppT*  
 Address of the variable which will receive the `CComPtrBase` pointer.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, E_POINTER on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 Copies the `CComPtrBase` pointer to *ppT*. The reference count on the [CComPtrBase::p](#p) member variable is incremented.  
  
 An error HRESULT will be returned if *ppT* is equal to NULL. In debug builds, an assertion error will occur if *ppT* is equal to NULL.  
  
##  <a name="detach"></a>  CComPtrBase::Detach  
 Call this method to release ownership of a pointer.  
  
```
T* Detach() throw();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns a copy of the pointer.  
  
### Remarks  
 Releases ownership of a pointer, sets the [CComPtrBase::p](#p) data member variable to NULL, and returns a copy of the pointer.  
  
##  <a name="isequalobject"></a>  CComPtrBase::IsEqualObject  
 Call this method to check if the specified `IUnknown` points to the same object associated with the `CComPtrBase` object.  
  
```
bool IsEqualObject(IUnknown* pOther) throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pOther*  
 The `IUnknown *` to compare.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns true if the objects are identical, false otherwise.  
  
##  <a name="operator_not"></a>  CComPtrBase::operator !  
 The NOT operator.  
  
```
bool operator!() const throw();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns true if the `CComHeapPtr` pointer is equal to NULL, false otherwise.  
  
##  <a name="operator_amp"></a>  CComPtrBase::operator &amp;  
 The & operator.  
  
```
T** operator&() throw();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns the address of the object pointed to by the `CComPtrBase` object.  
  
##  <a name="operator_star"></a>  CComPtrBase::operator *  
 The * operator.  
  
```
T& operator*() const throw();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns the value of [CComPtrBase::p](#p); that is, a pointer to the object referenced by the `CComPtrBase` object.  
  
 If debug builds, an assertion error will occur if [CComPtrBase::p](#p) is not equal to NULL.  
  
##  <a name="operator_eq_eq"></a>  CComPtrBase::operator ==  
 The equality operator.  
  
```
bool operator== (T* pT) const throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pT*  
 A pointer to an object.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns true if `CComPtrBase` and *pT* point to the same object, false otherwise.  
  
##  <a name="operator_ptr"></a>  CComPtrBase::operator -&gt;  

 The pointer-to-member operator.  
  
```
_NoAddRefReleaseOnCComPtr<T>* operator->() const throw();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns the value of the [CComPtrBase::p](#p) data member variable.  
  
### Remarks  
 Use this operator to call a method in a class pointed to by the `CComPtrBase` object. In debug builds, an assertion failure will occur if the `CComPtrBase` data member points to NULL.  
  
##  <a name="operator_lt"></a>  CComPtrBase::operator &lt;  
 The less-than operator.  
  
```
bool operator<(T* pT) const throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pT*  
 A pointer to an object.

##  <a name="operator_t_star"></a>  CComPtrBase::operator T*  
 The cast operator.  
  
```  
operator T*() const throw();
```  
  
### Remarks

 In debug builds, an assertion error will occur if *pp* is not equal to NULL.  
  
##  <a name="release"></a>  CComPtrBase::Release  
 Call this method to release the interface.  
  
```
