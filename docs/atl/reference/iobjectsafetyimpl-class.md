# IObjectSafetyImpl Class

This class provides a default implementation of the `IObjectSafety` interface to allow a client to retrieve and set an object's safety levels.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This class and its members cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime.

## Syntax

```
template <class T,DWORD dwSupportedSafety>  
class IObjectSafetyImpl
```

#### Parameters

*T*  
Your class, derived from `IObjectSafetyImpl`.

*dwSupportedSafety*  
Specifies the supported safety options for the control. Can be one of the following values:

- INTERFACESAFE_FOR_UNTRUSTED_CALLER The interface identified by the [SetInterfaceSafetyOptions](#setinterfacesafetyoptions) parameter `riid` should be made safe for scripting.

- INTERFACESAFE_FOR_UNTRUSTED_DATA The interface identified by the `SetInterfaceSafetyOptions` parameter `riid` should be made safe for untrusted data during initialization.

## Members

### Public Methods

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[IObjectSafetyImpl::GetInterfaceSafetyOptions](#getinterfacesafetyoptions)|Retrieves the safety options supported by the object, as well as the safety options currently set for the object.|
|[IObjectSafetyImpl::SetInterfaceSafetyOptions](#setinterfacesafetyoptions)|Makes the object safe for initialization or scripting.|

### Public Data Members

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[IObjectSafetyImpl::m_dwCurrentSafety](#m_dwcurrentsafety)|Stores the object's current safety level.|

## Remarks

Class `IObjectSafetyImpl` provides a default implementation of `IObjectSafety`. The `IObjectSafety` interface allows a client to retrieve and set an object's safety levels. For example, a web browser can call `IObjectSafety::SetInterfaceSafetyOptions` to make a control safe for initialization or safe for scripting.

Note that using the [IMPLEMENTED_CATEGORY](category-macros.md#implemented_category) macro with the CATID_SafeForScripting and CATID_SafeForInitializing component categories provides an alternative way of specifying that a component is safe.

## Inheritance Hierarchy

`IObjectSafety`

`IObjectSafetyImpl`

## Requirements

**Header:** atlctl.h

##  <a name="getinterfacesafetyoptions"></a>  IObjectSafetyImpl::GetInterfaceSafetyOptions

Retrieves the safety options supported by the object, as well as the safety options currently set for the object.

```
HRESULT GetInterfaceSafetyOptions(  
    REFIID riid,
    DWORD* pdwSupportedOptions,
    DWORD* pdwEnabledOptions);
```

### Remarks

The implementation returns the appropriate values for any interface supported by the object's implementation of `IUnknown::QueryInterface`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Any object that supports `IObjectSafety` is responsible for its own security, and that of any object it delegates. The programmer must take into account issues arising from running code in the user's context, cross-site scripting and perform suitable zone checking.

See [IObjectSafety::GetInterfaceSafetyOptions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa768223.aspx) in the Windows SDK.

##  <a name="m_dwcurrentsafety"></a>  IObjectSafetyImpl::m_dwCurrentSafety

Stores the object's current safety level.

```
DWORD m_dwCurrentSafety;
```

##  <a name="setinterfacesafetyoptions"></a>  IObjectSafetyImpl::SetInterfaceSafetyOptions

Makes the object safe for initialization or scripting by setting the [m_dwCurrentSafety](#m_dwcurrentsafety) member to the appropriate value.

```
HRESULT SetInterfaceSafetyOptions(  
    REFIID riid,
    DWORD dwOptionsSetMask,
    DWORD dwEnabledOptions);
```

### Remarks

The implementation returns E_NOINTERFACE for any interface not supported by the object's implementation of `IUnknown::QueryInterface`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Any object that supports `IObjectSafety` is responsible for its own security, and that of any object it delegates. The programmer must take into account issues arising from running code in the user's context, cross-site scripting and perform suitable zone checking.
