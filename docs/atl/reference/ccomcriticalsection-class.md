# CComCriticalSection Class
This class provides methods for obtaining and releasing ownership of a critical section object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
class CComCriticalSection
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CComCriticalSection::CComCriticalSection](#ccomcriticalsection)|The constructor.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CComCriticalSection::Init](#init)|Creates and initializes a critical section object.|  
|[CComCriticalSection::Lock](#lock)|Obtains ownership of the critical section object.|  
|[CComCriticalSection::Term](#term)|Releases system resources used by the critical section object.|  
|[CComCriticalSection::Unlock](#unlock)|Releases ownership of the critical section object.|  
  
### Public Data Members  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CComCriticalSection::m_sec](#m_sec)|A CRITICAL_SECTION object.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `CComCriticalSection` is similar to class [CComAutoCriticalSection](../../atl/reference/ccomautocriticalsection-class.md), except that you must explicitly initialize and release the critical section.  
  
 Typically, you use `CComCriticalSection` through the **typedef** name [CriticalSection](ccommultithreadmodel-class.md#criticalsection). This name references `CComCriticalSection` when [CComMultiThreadModel](../../atl/reference/ccommultithreadmodel-class.md) is being used.  

  
 See [CComCritSecLock Class](../../atl/reference/ccomcritseclock-class.md) for a safer way to use this class than calling `Lock` and `Unlock` directly.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** atlcore.h  
  
##  <a name="ccomcriticalsection"></a>  CComCriticalSection::CComCriticalSection  
 The constructor.  
  
```
CComCriticalSection() throw();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Sets the [m_sec](#m_sec) data member to NULL.  
  
##  <a name="init"></a>  CComCriticalSection::Init  
 Calls the Win32 function [InitializeCriticalSection](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms683472), which initializes the critical section object contained in the [m_sec](#m_sec) data member.  
  
```
HRESULT Init() throw();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, E_OUTOFMEMORY or E_FAIL on failure.  
  
##  <a name="lock"></a>  CComCriticalSection::Lock  
 Calls the Win32 function [EnterCriticalSection](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms682608), which waits until the thread can take ownership of the critical section object contained in the [m_sec](#m_sec) data member.  
  
```
HRESULT Lock() throw();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, E_OUTOFMEMORY or E_FAIL on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 The critical section object must first be initialized with a call to the [Init](#init) method. When the protected code has finished executing, the thread must call [Unlock](#unlock) to release ownership of the critical section.  
  
##  <a name="m_sec"></a>  CComCriticalSection::m_sec  
 Contains a critical section object that is used by all `CComCriticalSection` methods.  
  
```
CRITICAL_SECTION m_sec;
```  
  
##  <a name="term"></a>  CComCriticalSection::Term  
 Calls the Win32 function [DeleteCriticalSection](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms682552), which releases all resources used by the critical section object contained in the [m_sec](#m_sec) data member.  
  
```
HRESULT Term() throw();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK.  
  
### Remarks  
 Once `Term` has been called, the critical section can no longer be used for synchronization.  
  
##  <a name="unlock"></a>  CComCriticalSection::Unlock  
 Calls the Win32 function [LeaveCriticalSection](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms684169), which releases ownership of the critical section object contained in the [m_sec](#m_sec) data member.  
  
```
HRESULT Unlock() throw();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns S_OK.  
  
### Remarks  
 To first obtain ownership, the thread must call the [Lock](#lock) method. Each call to `Lock` requires a corresponding call to `Unlock` to release ownership of the critical section.
