# COM+ 1.0 Support in ATL Projects

You can use the [ATL Project Wizard](../../atl/reference/creating-an-atl-project.md) to create a project with basic support for COM+ 1.0 components.

COM+ 1.0 is designed for developing distributed component-based applications. It also provides a run-time infrastructure for deploying and managing these applications.

If you select the **Support COM+ 1.0** check box, the wizard modifies the build script in the link step. Specifically, the COM+ 1.0 project links to the following libraries:

- comsvcs.lib

- Mtxguid.lib

If you select the **Support COM+ 1.0** check box, you can also select **Support component registrar**. The component registrar allows your COM+ 1.0 object to get a list of components, register components, or unregister components (individually or all at once).
