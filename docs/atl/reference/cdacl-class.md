# CDacl Class
This class is a wrapper for a DACL (discretionary access-control list) structure.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This class and its members cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
class CDacl : public CAcl
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CDacl::CDacl](#cdacl)|The constructor.|  
|[CDacl::~CDacl](#dtor)|The destructor.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CDacl::AddAllowedAce](#addallowedace)|Adds an allowed ACE (access-control entry) to the `CDacl` object.|

|[CDacl::GetAceCount](#getacecount)|Returns the number of ACEs (access-control entries) in the `CDacl` object.|  
|[CDacl::RemoveAce](#removeace)|Removes a specific ACE (access-control entry) from the `CDacl` object.|

|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CDacl::operator =](#operator_eq)|Assignment operator.|  
  
## Remarks  
 An object's security descriptor can contain a DACL. A DACL contains zero or more ACEs (access-control entries) that identify the users and groups who can access the object. If a DACL is empty (that is, it contains zero ACEs), no access is explicitly granted, so access is implicitly denied. However, if an object's security descriptor does not have a DACL, the object is unprotected and everyone has complete access.  
  
 To retrieve an object's DACL, you must be the object's owner or have READ_CONTROL access to the object. To change an object's DACL, you must have WRITE_DAC access to the object.  
  
 Use the class methods provided to create, add, remove, and delete ACEs from the `CDacl` object. See also [AtlGetDacl](security-global-functions.md#atlgetdacl) and [AtlSetDacl](security-global-functions.md#atlsetdacl).  
  
 For an introduction to the access control model in Windows, see [Access Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa374860) in the Windows SDK.  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 [CAcl](../../atl/reference/cacl-class.md)  
  
 `CDacl`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** atlsecurity.h  
  
##  <a name="addallowedace"></a>  CDacl::AddAllowedAce  
 Adds an allowed ACE (access-control entry) to the `CDacl` object.  
  
```
bool AddAllowedAce(  
    const CSid& rSid,
    ACCESS_MASK AccessMask,
    BYTE AceFlags = 0) throw(...);

bool AddAllowedAce(  
    const CSid& rSid,
    ACCESS_MASK AccessMask,
    BYTE AceFlags,
    const GUID* pObjectType,
    const GUID* pInheritedObjectType) throw(...);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *rSid*  
 A [CSid](../../atl/reference/csid-class.md) object.  
  
 *AccessMask*  
 Specifies the mask of access rights to be allowed for the specified `CSid` object.  
  
 *AceFlags*  
 A set of bit flags that control ACE inheritance.  
  
 *pObjectType*  
 The object type.  
  
 *pInheritedObjectType*  
 The inherited object type.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns TRUE if the ACE is added to the `CDacl` object, FALSE on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 A `CDacl` object contains zero or more ACEs (access-control entries) that identify the users and groups who can access the object. This method adds an ACE that allows access to the `CDacl` object.  
  
 See [ACE_HEADER](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa374919) for a description of the various flags which can be set in the `AceFlags` parameter.  
  
##  <a name="adddeniedace"></a>  CDacl::AddDeniedAce  
 Adds a denied ACE (access-control entry) to the `CDacl` object.  
  
```
bool AddDeniedAce(  
    const CSid& rSid,
    ACCESS_MASK AccessMask,
    BYTE AceFlags = 0) throw(...);

bool AddDeniedAce(
    const CSid& rSid,
    ACCESS_MASK AccessMask,
    BYTE AceFlags,
    const GUID* pObjectType,
    const GUID* pInheritedObjectType) throw(...);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *rSid*  
 A `CSid` object.  
  
 *AccessMask*  
 Specifies the mask of access rights to be denied for the specified `CSid` object.  
  
 *AceFlags*  
 A set of bit flags that control ACE inheritance. Defaults to 0 in the first form of the method.  
  
 *pObjectType*  
 The object type.  
  
 *pInheritedObjectType*  
 The inherited object type.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns TRUE if the ACE is added to the `CDacl` object, FALSE on failure.  
  
### Remarks  
 A `CDacl` object contains zero or more ACEs (access-control entries) that identify the users and groups who can access the object. This method adds an ACE that denies access to the `CDacl` object.  
  
 See [ACE_HEADER](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa374919) for a description of the various flags which can be set in the `AceFlags` parameter.  
  
##  <a name="cdacl"></a>  CDacl::CDacl  
 The constructor.  
  
```
CDacl (const ACL& rhs) throw(...);  
CDacl () throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *rhs*  
 An existing `ACL` (access-control list) structure.  
  
### Remarks  
 The `CDacl` object can be optionally created using an existing `ACL` structure. It is important to note that only a DACL (discretionary access-control list), and not a SACL (system access-control list), should be passed as this parameter. In debug builds, passing a SACL will cause an ASSERT. In release builds, passing a SACL will cause the ACEs (access-control entries) in the ACL to be ignored, and no error will occur.  
  
##  <a name="dtor"></a>  CDacl::~CDacl  
 The destructor.  
  
```
~CDacl () throw();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The destructor frees any resources acquired by the object, including all ACEs (access-control entries) using [CDacl::RemoveAllAces](#removeallaces).  
  
##  <a name="getacecount"></a>  CDacl::GetAceCount  
 Returns the number of ACEs (access-control entries) in the `CDacl` object.  
  
```
UINT GetAceCount() const throw();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns the number of ACEs contained in the `CDacl` object.  
  
##  <a name="operator_eq"></a>  CDacl::operator =  
 Assignment operator.  
  
```
CDacl& operator= (const ACL& rhs) throw(...);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *rhs*  
 The ACL (access-control list) to assign to the existing object.  
  
### Return Value  
 Returns a reference to the updated `CDacl` object.  
  
### Remarks  
 You should ensure that you only pass a DACL (discretionary access-control list) to this function. Passing a SACL (system access-control list) to this function will cause an ASSERT in debug builds but will cause no error in release builds.  
  
##  <a name="removeace"></a>  CDacl::RemoveAce  
 Removes a specific ACE (access-control entry) from the `CDacl` object.  
  
```
void RemoveAce(UINT nIndex) throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *nIndex*  
 Index to the ACE entry to remove.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method is derived from [CAtlArray::RemoveAt](../../atl/reference/catlarray-class.md#removeat).  
  
##  <a name="removeallaces"></a>  CDacl::RemoveAllAces  
 Removes all of the ACEs (access-control entries) contained in the `CDacl` object.  
  
```
void RemoveAllAces() throw();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Removes every `ACE` (access-control entry) structure (if any) in the `CDacl` object.
