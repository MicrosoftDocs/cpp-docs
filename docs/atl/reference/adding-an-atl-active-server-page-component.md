To add an Active Template Library (ATL) object to your project, your project must have been created as an ATL COM application or as an MFC application that contains ATL support. You can use the [ATL Project Wizard](../../atl/reference/atl-project-wizard.md) to create an ATL application, you can select **Add ATL Support to MFC** from the [Add Class Dialog Box](../../ide/adding-a-class-visual-cpp.md#add-class-dialog-box) dialog box, or you can [add an ATL object to your MFC application](../../mfc/reference/adding-atl-support-to-your-mfc-project.md) to implement ATL support for an MFC application.

Active Server Pages components are part of the Internet Information Services architecture, which provides the following advanced Web development features:

- You can embed ASP components into your HTML pages to create dynamic, browser-independent content.

- You can use ASP pages to provide standards-based database connectivity.

- You can use the ASP error-handling capabilities for your Web-based applications.

## To add an ATL Active Server Pages component to your project

1. In **Solution Explorer** right-click the name of the project to which you want to add the ATL Active Server Pages component.

1. From the shortcut menu, click **Add**, and then click **Add Class**.

1. In the [Add Class](../../ide/adding-a-class-visual-cpp.md#add-class-dialog-box) dialog box, in the **Templates** pane, click **ATL Active Server Page Component**, and then click **Open** to display the [ATL Active Server Page Component Wizard](../../atl/reference/atl-active-server-page-component-wizard.md).
