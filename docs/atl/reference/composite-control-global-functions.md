## Requirements  
 **Header:** atlhost.h  

##  <a name="atlaxdialogbox"></a>  AtlAxDialogBox  
 Creates a modal dialog box from a dialog template provided by the user.  
   
```
ATLAPI_(int) AtlAxDialogBox(
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    LPCWSTR lpTemplateName,
    HWND hWndParent,
    DLGPROC lpDialogProc,
    LPARAM dwInitParam);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *hInstance*  
 [in] Identifies an instance of the module whose executable file contains the dialog box template.  
  
 *lpTemplateName*  
 [in] Identifies the dialog box template. This parameter is either the pointer to a null-terminated character string that specifies the name of the dialog box template or an integer value that specifies the resource identifier of the dialog box template. If the parameter specifies a resource identifier, its high-order word must be zero and its low-order word must contain the identifier. You can use the [MAKEINTRESOURCE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms648029) macro to create this value.  
  
 *hWndParent*  
 [in] Identifies the window that owns the dialog box.  
  
 *lpDialogProc*  
 [in] Points to the dialog box procedure. For more information about the dialog box procedure, see [DialogProc](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645469).  
  
 *dwInitParam*  
 [in] Specifies the value to pass to the dialog box in the *lParam* parameter of the WM_INITDIALOG message.  
  
### Return Value  
 One of the standard HRESULT values.  
  
### Remarks  
 To use `AtlAxDialogBox` with a dialog template that contains an ActiveX control, specify a valid CLSID, APPID or URL string as the *text* field of the **CONTROL** section of the dialog resource, along with "AtlAxWin80" as the *class name* field under the same section. The following demonstrates what a valid **CONTROL** section might look like:  
  
```  
CONTROL    "{04FE35E9-ADBC-4f1d-83FE-8FA4D1F71C7F}", IDC_TEST,  
    "AtlAxWin80", WS_GROUP | WS_TABSTOP, 0, 0, 100, 100  
```  
  
 For more information on editing resource scripts, see [How to: Open a Resource Script File in Text Format](../../windows/how-to-open-a-resource-script-file-in-text-format.md). For more information on control resource-definition statements, see [Common Control Parameters](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa380902) under Windows SDK*: SDK Tools*.

##  <a name="atlaxwininit"></a>  AtlAxWinInit  
 This function initializes ATL's control hosting code by registering the **"AtlAxWin80"** and **"AtlAxWinLic80"** window classes plus a couple of custom window messages.  
  
```
ATLAPI_(BOOL) AtlAxWinInit();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if the initialization of the control hosting code was successful; otherwise FALSE.  
  
### Remarks  
 This function must be called before using the ATL control hosting API. Following a call to this function, the **"AtlAxWin"** window class can be used in calls to [CreateWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632679) or [CreateWindowEx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632680), as described in the Windows SDK.  

##  <a name="atlaxwinterm"></a>  AtlAxWinTerm  
 This function uninitializes ATL's control hosting code by unregistering the **"AtlAxWin80"** and **"AtlAxWinLic80"** window classes.  
  
```
inline BOOL AtlAxWinTerm();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Always returns TRUE.  
  
### Remarks  
 This function simply calls [UnregisterClass](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644899) as described in the Windows SDK.  
  
 Call this function to clean up after all existing host windows have been destroyed if you called [AtlAxWinInit](#atlaxwininit) and you no longer need to create host windows. If you don't call this function, the window class will be unregistered automatically when the process terminates.  
  
##  <a name="atlgetobjectsourceinterface"></a>  AtlGetObjectSourceInterface  
 Call this function to retrieve information about the default source interface of an object.  
  
```
ATLAPI AtlGetObjectSourceInterface(
    IUnknown* punkObj,
    GUID* plibid,
    IID* piid,
    unsigned short* pdwMajor,
    unsigned short* pdwMinor);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *punkObj*  
 [in] A pointer to the object for which information is to be returned.  
  
 *plibid*  
 [out] A pointer to the LIBID of the type library containing the definition of the source interface.  
  
 *piid*  
 [out] A pointer to the interface ID of the object's default source interface.  
  
 *pdwMajor*  
 [out] A pointer to the major version number of the type library containing the definition of the source interface.  
  
 *pdwMinor*  
 [out] A pointer to the minor version number of the type library containing the definition of the source interface.  
  
### Return Value  
 A standard HRESULT value.  
  
### Remarks  
 `AtlGetObjectSourceInterface` can provide you with the interface ID of the default source interface, along with the LIBID and major and minor version numbers of the type library describing that interface.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For this function to successfully retrieve the requested information, the object represented by *punkObj* must implement `IDispatch` (and return type information through `IDispatch::GetTypeInfo`) plus it must also implement either `IProvideClassInfo2` or `IPersist`. The type information for the source interface must be in the same type library as the type information for `IDispatch`.  
  
### Example  
 The example below shows how you might define an event sink class, `CEasySink`, that reduces the number of template arguments that you can pass to `IDispEventImpl` to the bare essentials. `EasyAdvise` and `EasyUnadvise` use `AtlGetObjectSourceInterface` to initialize the [IDispEventImpl](../../atl/reference/idispeventimpl-class.md) members before calling [DispEventAdvise](idispeventsimpleimpl-class.md#dispeventadvise) or [DispEventUnadvise](idispeventsimpleimpl-class.md#dispeventunadvise).
