# CFirePropNotifyEvent Class

This class provides methods for notifying the container's sink regarding control property changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This class and its members cannot be used in applications that execute in the Windows Runtime.

## Syntax

```
class CFirePropNotifyEvent
```

## Members

### Public Methods

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[CFirePropNotifyEvent::FireOnChanged](#fireonchanged)|(Static) Notifies the container's sink that a control property has changed.|
|[CFirePropNotifyEvent::FireOnRequestEdit](#fireonrequestedit)|(Static) Notifies the container's sink that a control property is about to change.|

## Remarks

`CFirePropNotifyEvent` has two methods that notify the container's sink that a control property has changed or is about to change.

If the class implementing your control is derived from `IPropertyNotifySink`, the `CFirePropNotifyEvent` methods are invoked when you call `FireOnRequestEdit` or `FireOnChanged`. If your control class is not derived from `IPropertyNotifySink`, calls to these functions return S_OK.

For more information about creating controls, see the [ATL Tutorial](../../atl/active-template-library-atl-tutorial.md).

## Requirements

**Header:** atlctl.h

##  <a name="fireonchanged"></a>  CFirePropNotifyEvent::FireOnChanged

Notifies all connected [IPropertyNotifySink](/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-ipropertynotifysink) interfaces (on every connection point of the object) that the specified object property has changed.

```
static HRESULT FireOnChanged(IUnknown* pUnk, DISPID dispID);
```

### Parameters

*pUnk*  
[in] Pointer to the `IUnknown` of the object sending the notification.

*dispID*  
[in] Identifier of the property that has changed.

### Return Value

One of the standard HRESULT values.

### Remarks

This function is safe to call even if your control does not support connection points.

##  <a name="fireonrequestedit"></a>  CFirePropNotifyEvent::FireOnRequestEdit

Notifies all connected [IPropertyNotifySink](/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-ipropertynotifysink) interfaces (on every connection point of the object) that the specified object property is about to change.

```
static HRESULT FireOnRequestEdit(IUnknown* pUnk, DISPID dispID);
```

### Parameters

*pUnk*  
[in] Pointer to the `IUnknown` of the object sending the notification.

*dispID*  
[in] Identifier of the property about to change.

### Return Value

One of the standard HRESULT values.

### Remarks

This function is safe to call even if your control does not support connection points.
