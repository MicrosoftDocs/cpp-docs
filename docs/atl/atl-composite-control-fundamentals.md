# ATL Composite Control Fundamentals

A composite control is a type of ActiveX control that can contain (similar to a dialog box) other ActiveX controls or Windows controls. Once the composite control is built, it can be inserted anywhere an ActiveX control can be hosted.

The ATL Project Wizard and **Add Class** dialog box automate the process of creating and implementing a composite control project, similar to the result of running the Application Wizard to create an MFC application framework. The development process consists of five steps:

- [Creating an ATL project](../atl/reference/creating-an-atl-project.md)

- [Inserting a composite control](../atl/inserting-a-composite-control.md)

- [Modifying the ATL project](../atl/modifying-the-atl-project.md)

- [Adding functionality to the composite control](../atl/adding-functionality-to-the-composite-control.md)

- [Building and testing the ATL project](../atl/building-and-testing-the-atl-project.md)
