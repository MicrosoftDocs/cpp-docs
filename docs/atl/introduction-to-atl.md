# Introduction to ATL
ATL is the Active Template Library, a set of template-based C++ classes with which you can easily create small, fast Component Object Model (COM) objects. It has special support for key COM features including: stock implementations of [IUnknown](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms680509), [IClassFactory](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms694364), [IClassFactory2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms692720), and `IDispatch`; dual interfaces; standard COM enumerator interfaces; connection points; tear-off interfaces; and ActiveX controls.  
  
 ATL code can be used to create single-threaded objects, apartment-model objects, free-threaded model objects, or both free-threaded and apartment-model objects.  
  
 Topics covered in this section include:  
  
-   How a [template library](../atl/using-a-template-library.md) differs from a standard C++ library.  
  
-   What you [can and cannot do with ATL](../atl/scope-of-atl.md).  
  
-   [Recommendations for choosing between ATL and MFC](../atl/recommendations-for-choosing-between-atl-and-mfc.md).
