# Introduction to ATL

ATL is the Active Template Library, a set of template-based C++ classes with which you can easily create small, fast Component Object Model (COM) objects. It has special support for key COM features including: stock implementations of [IUnknown](/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown), [IClassFactory](/windows/win32/api/unknwnbase/nn-unknwnbase-iclassfactory), [IClassFactory2](/windows/win32/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-iclassfactory2), and `IDispatch`; dual interfaces; standard COM enumerator interfaces; connection points; tear-off interfaces; and ActiveX controls.

ATL code can be used to create single-threaded objects, apartment-model objects, free-threaded model objects, or both free-threaded and apartment-model objects.

Topics covered in this section include:

- How a [template library](../atl/using-a-template-library.md) differs from a standard library.

- What you [can and cannot do with ATL](../atl/scope-of-atl.md).

- [Recommendations for choosing between ATL and MFC](../atl/recommendations-for-choosing-between-atl-and-mfc.md).
