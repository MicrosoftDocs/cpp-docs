# Interface Pointers Classes

The following classes manage a given interface pointer:

- [CComPtr](../atl/reference/ccomptr-class.md) Performs automatic reference counting.

- [CComQIPtr](../atl/reference/ccomqiptr-class.md) Similar to `CComPtr`, but also performs automatic querying of interfaces.

- [CInterfaceArray](../atl/reference/cinterfacearray-class.md) Provides methods useful when constructing an array of COM interface pointers.

- [CInterfaceList](../atl/reference/cinterfacelist-class.md) Provides methods useful when constructing a list of COM interface pointers.

- [CComGITPtr](../atl/reference/ccomgitptr-class.md) Provides methods for dealing with interface pointers and the global interface table (GIT).
