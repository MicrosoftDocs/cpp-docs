# String and Text Classes

These classes provide support for strings and text string conversions.

- [CA2CAEX](../atl/reference/ca2caex-class.md) This class is used by string conversion macros CA2CTEX and CT2CAEX, and the typedef CA2CA.

- [CA2WEX](../atl/reference/ca2wex-class.md) This class is used by the string conversion macros CA2TEX, CA2CTEX, CT2WEX, and CT2CWEX, and the typedef CA2W.

- [CW2AEX](../atl/reference/cw2aex-class.md) This class is used by the string conversion macros CT2AEX, CW2TEX, CW2CTEX, and CT2CAEX, and the typedef CW2A.

- [CW2CWEX](../atl/reference/cw2cwex-class.md) This class is used by the string conversion macros CW2CTEX and CT2CWEX, and the typedef CW2CW.

- [CW2WEX](../atl/reference/cw2wex-class.md) This class is used by the string conversion macros CW2TEX and CT2WEX, and the typedef CW2W.

- [CComBSTR](../atl/reference/ccombstr-class.md) This class is a wrapper for BSTRs.

- [_U_STRINGorID](../atl/reference/u-stringorid-class.md) This argument adapter class allows either resource names (`LPCTSTR`s) or resource IDs (UINTs) to be passed to a function without requiring the caller to convert the ID to a string using the MAKEINTRESOURCE macro.
