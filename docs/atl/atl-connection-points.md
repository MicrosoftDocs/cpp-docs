# ATL Connection Points

A connectable object is one that supports outgoing interfaces. An outgoing interface allows the object to communicate with a client. For each outgoing interface, the connectable object exposes a connection point. Each outgoing interface is implemented by a client on an object called a sink.

Each connection point supports the [IConnectionPoint](/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-iconnectionpoint) interface. The connectable object exposes its connection points to the client through the [IConnectionPointContainer](/windows/desktop/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-iconnectionpointcontainer) interface.
