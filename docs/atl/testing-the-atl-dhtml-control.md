# Testing the ATL DHTML Control

Once you have created your project, you can build and test the sample control. Before you do this, use **Class View** and **Solution Explorer** to examine the project. The elements of your project are described in greater detail in [Identifying the Elements of the DHTML Control Project](../atl/identifying-the-elements-of-the-dhtml-control-project.md).

## To build and test the ATL DHTML control

1. Build the project. From the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.

1. When the build is completed, open **Test Container**. See [Testing Properties and Events with Test Container](../mfc/testing-properties-and-events-with-test-container.md) for information on how to access **Test Container**.

1. In **Test Container**, from the **Edit** menu, click **Insert New Control**.

1. In the **Insert Control** dialog box, select your control from the list box. Remember, its name is based on the short name you indicated in the ATL Control Wizard. Click **OK**.

1. Examine the control. Note that it has a scroll bar. Use the control's handles to resize the control to activate the scrollbar.

1. Test the control's buttons. The background color changes to the color indicated by the button.

1. Close **Test Container**.

Next, try [modifying the DHTML control](../atl/modifying-the-atl-dhtml-control.md).
