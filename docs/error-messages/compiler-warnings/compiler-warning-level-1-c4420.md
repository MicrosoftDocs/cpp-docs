# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4420

> 'operator' : operator not available, using 'operator' instead; run-time checking may be compromised

## Remarks

This warning is generated when you use the [/RTCv](../../build/reference/rtc-run-time-error-checks.md) (vector new/delete checking) and when no vector form is found. In this case, the non-vector form is used.

In order for /RTCv to work correctly, the compiler should always call the vector form of [new](../../cpp/new-operator-cpp.md)/[delete](../../cpp/delete-operator-cpp.md) if the vector syntax was used.
