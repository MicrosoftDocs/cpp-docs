# Compiler Warning (level 3) C4414
'function' : short jump to function converted to near  
  
 Short jumps generate compact instruction which branches to an address within a limited range from the instruction. The instruction includes a short offset that represents the distance between the jump and the target address, the function definition. During linking a function may be moved or subject to link-time optimizations that cause the function to be moved out of the range reachable from a short offset. The compiler must generate a special record for the jump, which requires the jmp instruction to be either NEAR or FAR. The compiler made the conversion.  
  
 For example, the following code generates C4414:  
  
```  
// C4414.cpp  
// compile with: /W3 /c  
// processor: x86  
int DoParityEven();  
int DoParityOdd();  
unsigned char global;  
int __declspec(naked) DoParityEither()  
{  
   __asm  
   {  
      test global,0  
      jpe SHORT DoParityEven  // C4414  
      jmp SHORT DoParityOdd   // C4414  
   }  
}  
```
