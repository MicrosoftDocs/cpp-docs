# Compiler Warning C4694

> '*class*': a sealed abstract class cannot have a base-class '*base_class*'

## Remarks

An abstract and sealed class cannot inherit from a reference type; a sealed and abstract class can neither implement the base class functions nor allow itself to be used as a base class.

For more information, see [abstract](../../extensions/abstract-cpp-component-extensions.md), [sealed](../../extensions/sealed-cpp-component-extensions.md), and [Classes and Structs](../../extensions/classes-and-structs-cpp-component-extensions.md).

This warning is automatically promoted to an error. If you wish to modify this behavior, use [#pragma warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md).

## Example

The following example generates C4694.

```cpp
// C4694.cpp
// compile with: /c /clr
ref struct A {};
ref struct B sealed abstract : A {};   // C4694
```
