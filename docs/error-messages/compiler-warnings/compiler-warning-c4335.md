# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4335

> Mac file format detected: please convert the source file to either DOS or UNIX format

## Remarks

The line termination character of the first line of a source file is the old Macintosh style ('\r') as opposed to UNIX ('\n') or DOS ('\r\n').

This warning is only issued once per translation unit. Therefore, if there are multiple `#include` directives that specify files in Macintosh format, C4335 is emitted once.

One way to generate files in Macintosh format is by using the **Advanced Save Options** (on the **File** menu) in Visual Studio.

## Example

The following example generates C4335:

```cpp
// C4335 expected
#include "c4335.h"   // assume both include files are in Macintosh format
#include "c4335_2.h"
```
