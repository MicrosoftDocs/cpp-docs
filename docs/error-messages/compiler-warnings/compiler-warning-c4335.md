# Compiler Warning C4335
Mac file format detected: please convert the source file to either DOS or UNIX format  
  
 The line termination character of the first line of a source file is Macintosh style ('\r') as opposed to UNIX ('\n') or DOS ('\r\n').  
  
 This warning is always issued as an errror.  See [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma for information about how to disable this warning.  Also, this warning is only issued once per compiland. Therefore, if there are multiple `#include` directives that specify files in Macintosh format, C4335 will only be issued once.  
  
 One way to generate files in Macintosh format is by using the **Advanced Save Options** (on the **File** menu) in Visual Studio.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C4335.  
  
```  
// C4335 expected  
#include "c4335.h"   // assume both include files are in Macintosh format  
#include "c4335_2.h"  
```
