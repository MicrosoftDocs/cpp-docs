# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4339
'type' : use of undefined type detected in WinRT or CLR meta-data - use of this type may lead to a runtime exception  
  
 A type was not defined in code that was compiled for Windows Runtime or the common language runtime. Define the type to avoid a possible runtime exception.  
  
 This warning is off by default. See [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md) for more information.  
  
 The following sample generates C4339 and shows how to fix it:  
  
```  
// C4339.cpp  
// compile with: /W4 /clr /c  
// C4339 expected  
#pragma warning(default : 4339)  
  
// Delete the following line to resolve.  
class A;  
  
// Uncomment the following line to resolve.  
// class A{};  
  
class X {  
public:  
   X() {}  
  
   virtual A *mf() {  
      return 0;  
   }  
};  
  
X * f() {  
   return new X();  
}  
```
