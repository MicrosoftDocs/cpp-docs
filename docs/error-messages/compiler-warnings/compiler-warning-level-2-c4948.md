# Compiler Warning (level 2) C4948

> return type of 'accessor' does not match the last parameter type of the corresponding setter

## Remarks

The compiler found a mismatch between what data type is being get and set for an indexed property.

C4948 is only reachable using the obsolete compiler option **/clr:oldSyntax**.
