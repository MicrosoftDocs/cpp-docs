# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4256

> 'function' : constructor for class with virtual bases has '...'; calls may not be compatible with older versions of Visual C++

## Remarks

Possible incompatibility.

Consider the following code example. If the definition of the constructor S2::S2( int i, ... ) was compiled by using a version of the Microsoft C++ compiler before version 7, but the following example is compiled by using the current version, the call to the constructor for S3 would not work correctly because of a special-case calling-convention change. If both were compiled by using Visual C++ 6.0, the call would not work quite right either, unless no parameters were passed for the ellipsis.

To fix this warning,

1. Don't use ellipsis in a constructor.

1. Make sure that all components in their project are built with the current version (including any libraries that may define or reference this class), then disable the warning using the [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma.

## Example

The following example generates C4256:

```cpp
// C4256.cpp
// compile with: /W4
// #pragma warning(disable : 4256)
struct S1
{
};

struct S2: virtual public S1
{
   S2( int i, ... )    // C4256
   {
      i = 0;
   }
   /*
   // try the following line instead
   S2( int i)
   {
      i = 0;
   }
   */
};

void func1()
{
   S2 S3( 2, 1, 2 );   // C4256
   // try the following line instead
   // S2 S3( 2 );
}

int main()
{
}
```
