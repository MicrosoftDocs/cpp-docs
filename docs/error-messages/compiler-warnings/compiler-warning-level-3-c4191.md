# Compiler Warning (level 3, off) C4191

> '*operation*': unsafe conversion from '*type_of_expression*' to '*type_required*'<br/>Making a function call using the resulting pointer may cause your program to fail

## Remarks

Several operations involving function pointers are considered unsafe:

- Function types with different calling conventions.

- Function types with different return conventions.

- Argument or return types with different sizes, type categories, or classifications.

- Different argument list lengths (on **`__cdecl`**, only on cast from longer list to shorter list, even if shorter is varargs).

- Pointer to data (other than **`void*`**) aliased against a pointer to function.

- Any other type difference that would yield an error or warning on a **`reinterpret_cast`**.

Calling this function through the result pointer might cause your program to crash.

This warning is off by default. For more information, see [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md).

## Example

The following example generates C4191:

```cpp
// C4191.cpp
// compile with: /W3 /clr
#pragma warning(default: 4191)

void __clrcall f1() { }
void __cdecl   f2() { }

typedef void (__clrcall * fnptr1)();
typedef void (__cdecl   * fnptr2)();

int main() {
   fnptr1 fp1 = static_cast<fnptr1>(&f1);
   fnptr2 fp2 = (fnptr2) &f2;

   fnptr1 fp3 = (fnptr1) &f2;   // C4191
   fnptr2 fp4 = (fnptr2) &f1;   // C4191
}
```
