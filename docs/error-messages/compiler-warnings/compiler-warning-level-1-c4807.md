# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4807
'operation' : unsafe mix of type 'type' and signed bitfield of type 'type'  
  
 This warning is generated when comparing a one-bit signed bit field to a `bool` variable. Because a one-bit, signed bit field can only contain the values -1 or 0, it is dangerous to compare it to `bool`. No warnings are generated about mixing `bool` and one-bit, unsigned bitfields since they are identical to `bool` and can only hold 0 or 1.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C4807:  
  
```  
// C4807.cpp  
// compile with: /W1  
typedef struct bitfield {  
   signed mybit : 1;  
} mybitfield;  
  
int main() {  
   mybitfield bf;  
   bool b = true;  
  
   // try..  
   // int b = true;  
  
   bf.mybit = -1;  
   if (b == bf.mybit) {   // C4807  
      b = false;  
   }  
}  
```
