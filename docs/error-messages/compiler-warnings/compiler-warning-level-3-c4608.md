# Compiler Warning (level 3) C4608
'union_member' has already been initialized by another union member in the initializer list, 'union_member'  
  
 Two members of the same union were initialized in an initialization list. You can only access one member of the union.  
  
 The following sample generates C4608:  
  
```  
// C4608.cpp  
// compile with: /W3 /c  
class X {  
public:  
   X(char c) : m_i( c + 1), m_c(c) {}   // C4608  
   // try the following line instead  
   // X(char c) : m_c(c) {}  
  
private:  
   union {  
      int m_i;  
      char m_c;  
   };  
};  
  
union Y {  
public:  
   Y(char * name) : m_number(0.3), m_string( name ) {} // C4608  
  
private:  
   double m_number;  
   char * m_string;  
};  
```
