# Compiler Warning (Level 1) C4742
'var' has different alignment in 'file1' and 'file2': number and number  
  
 An external variable that was referenced or defined in two files has different alignment in those files. This warning is emitted when compiler finds that `__alignof` for the variable in *file1* differs from `__alignof` for the variable in *file2*. This can be caused by using incompatible types when declaring variable in different files, or by using non-matching `#pragma pack` in different files.  
  
 To resolve this warning, either use the same type definition or use different names for the variables.  
  
 For more information, see [pack](../../preprocessor/pack.md) and [__alignof Operator](../../cpp/alignof-operator.md).  
  
## Example  
 This is the first file that defines the type.  
  
```  
// C4742a.c  
// compile with: /c  
struct X {  
   char x, y, z, w;  
} global;  
```  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C4742.  
  
```  
// C4742b.c  
// compile with: C4742a.c /W1 /GL  
// C4742 expected  
extern struct X {  
   int a;  
} global;  
  
int main() {  
   global.a = 0;  
}  
```
