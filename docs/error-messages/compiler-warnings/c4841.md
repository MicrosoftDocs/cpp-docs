# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4841

> non-standard extension used: compound member designator used in `offsetof`

## Remarks

If you use `offsetof(T, m)`, where *`m`* is a compound member designator, the compiler generates a warning when you compile with the **`/Wall`** option.

This warning is new in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, and is off by default. Use [`/Wall`](../../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md) to enable all warnings that are off by default, or **`/w14841`** to enable C4841 as a level 1 warning. For more information, see [Compiler warnings that are off by default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md). For information on how to disable warnings by compiler version, see [Compiler warnings by compiler version](compiler-warnings-by-compiler-version.md).

## Example

The following code is ill-formed and could potentially cause a crash at runtime:

```cpp
struct A {
   int arr[10];
};

// warning C4841: non-standard extension used: compound member designator in offsetof
constexpr auto off = offsetof(A, arr[2]);
```

To fix the issue, change the code to not use `offsetof` with a compound member designator.
