# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4714
function 'function' marked as __forceinline not inlined  
  
 The given function was selected for inline expansion, but the compiler did not perform the inlining.  
  
 Although `__forceinline` is a stronger indication to the compiler than `__inline`, inlining is still performed at the compiler's discretion, but no heuristics are used to determine the benefits from inlining this function.  
  
 In some cases, the compiler will not inline a particular function for mechanical reasons. For example, the compiler will not inline:  
  
-   A function if it would result in mixing both SEH and C++ EH.  
  
-   Some functions with copy constructed objects passed by value when -GX/EHs/EHa is on.  
  
-   Functions returning an unwindable object by value when -GX/EHs/EHa is on.  
  
-   Functions with inline assembly when compiling without -Og/Ox/O1/O2.  
  
-   Functions with a variable argument list.  
  
-   A function with a **try** (C++ exception handling) statement.  
  
 The following sample generates C4714:  
  
```  
// C4714.cpp  
// compile with: /Ob1 /GX /W4  
__forceinline void func1()  
{  
   try  
   {  
   }  
   catch (...)  
   {  
   }  
}  
  
void func2()  
{  
   func1();   // C4714  
}  
  
int main()  
{  
}  
```
