# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4747

> Calling managed 'entrypoint': Managed code may not be run under loader lock, including the DLL entrypoint and calls reached from the DLL entrypoint

## Remarks

The compiler found a (probable) DLL entry point compiled to MSIL.  Because of potential problems with loading a DLL whose entry point has been compiled to MSIL, you are strongly discouraged from compiling a DLL entry point function to MSIL.

For more information, see [Initialization of Mixed Assemblies](../../dotnet/initialization-of-mixed-assemblies.md) and [Linker Tools Error LNK1306](../../error-messages/tool-errors/linker-tools-error-lnk1306.md).

### To correct this error

1. Do not compile the module with **/clr**.

1. Mark the entry point function with `#pragma unmanaged`.

## Example

The following example generates C4747.

```cpp
// C4747.cpp
// compile with: /clr /c /W1
// C4747 expected
#include <windows.h>

// Uncomment the following line to resolve.
// #pragma unmanaged

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HANDLE hInstance, ULONG Command, LPVOID Reserved) {
   return TRUE;
}
```
