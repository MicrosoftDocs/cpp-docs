# Compiler warning (level 1) C5055

> operator '*operator-name*': deprecated between enumerations and floating-point types

## Remarks

C++20 has deprecated the usual arithmetic conversions on operands, where one operand is of enumeration type and the other is of floating-point type. For more information, see C++ Standard proposal [P1120R0](https://wg21.link/p1120r0).

In Visual Studio 2019 version 16.2 and later, an implicit conversion between enumeration types and floating-point types produces a level 1 warning when the **`/std:c++latest`** compiler option is enabled. In Visual Studio 2019 version 16.11 and later, it also produces a warning under **`/std:c++20`**.

## Example

In Visual Studio 2019 version 16.2 and later, a binary operation between an enumeration and a floating-point type produces a level 1 warning when the **`/std:c++latest`** compiler option is enabled. In Visual Studio 2019 version 16.11 and later, it also produces a warning under **`/std:c++20`**:

```cpp
// C5055.cpp
// Compile using: cl /EHsc /W4 /std:c++latest C5055.cpp
enum E1 { a };
int main() {
  double i = a * 1.1; // Warning C5055: operator '*': deprecated between enumerations and floating-point types
}
```

To avoid the warning, use [`static_cast`](../../cpp/static-cast-operator.md) to convert the second operand:

```cpp
// C5055_fixed.cpp
// Compile using: cl /EHsc /W4 /std:c++latest C5055_fixed.cpp
enum E1 { a };
int main() {
   double i = static_cast<int>(a) * 1.1;
}
```
