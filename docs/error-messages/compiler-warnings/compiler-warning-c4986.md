# Compiler Warning C4986

> 'function': exception specification does not match previous declaration

This warning can be generated when there is an exception specification in one declaration and not the other.

By default, C4986 is off. For more information, see [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md).

## Examples

The following sample generates C4986.

```cpp
class X { };
void f1() throw (X*);
// ...
void f1()
{
    // ...
}
```

The following sample eliminates this warning.

```cpp
class X { };
void f1() throw (X*);
// ...
void f1() throw (X*)
{
    // ...
}
```
