# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4436
dynamic_cast from virtual base 'class1' to 'class2' in constructor or destructor could fail with partially-constructed object        Compile with /vd2 or define 'class2' with #pragma vtordisp(2) in effect  
  
 The compiler has encountered a `dynamic_cast` operation with the following characteristics.  
  
-   The cast is from a base class pointer to a derived class pointer.  
  
-   The derived class virtually inherits the base class.  
  
-   The derived class does not have a `vtordisp` field for the virtual base.  
  
-   The cast is found in a constructor or destructor of the derived class, or some class which further inherits from the derived class.  
  
 The warning indicates the `dynamic_cast` might not perform correctly, if it is operating on a partially-constructed object.  That happens if the derived constructor/destructor is operating on a sub-object of some further derived object.  If the derived class named in the warning is never further derived, the warning can be ignored.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C4436 and demonstrates the code generation issue that arises from the missing `vtordisp` field.  
  
```cpp  
// C4436.cpp  
// To see the warning and runtime assert, compile with: /W1  
// To eliminate the warning and assert, compile with: /W1 /vd2  
//       or compile with: /W1 /DFIX  
#include <cassert>  
  
struct A  
{  
public:  
    virtual ~A() {}  
};  
  
#if defined(FIX)  
#pragma vtordisp(push, 2)  
#endif  
struct B : virtual A  
{  
    B()  
    {  
        A* a = static_cast<A*>(this);  
        B* b = dynamic_cast<B*>(a);     // C4436  
        assert(this == b);              // assert unless compiled with /vd2  
    }  
};  
#if defined(FIX)  
#pragma vtordisp(pop)  
#endif  
  
struct C : B  
{  
    int i;  
};  
  
int main()  
{  
    C c;  
}  
```
