# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4552
'operator' : operator has no effect; expected operator with side-effect  
  
 If an expression statement has an operator with no side effect as the top of the expression, it's probably a mistake.  
  
 To override this warning, put the expression in parentheses.  
  
 The following sample generates C4552:  
  
```  
// C4552.cpp  
// compile with: /W1  
int main() {  
   int i, j;  
   i + j;   // C4552  
   // try the following line instead  
   // (i + j);  
}  
```
