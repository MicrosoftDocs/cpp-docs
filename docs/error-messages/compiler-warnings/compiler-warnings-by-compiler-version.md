# Compiler Warnings by compiler version

The compiler can suppress warnings that were introduced after a version you specify by using the [/Wv](../../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md) compiler option. This is useful for managing your build process when you introduce a new toolset version, and want to temporarily suppress new warnings. This option does not suppress new error messages. We do not recommend you suppress all new warnings permanently! We recommend you always compile at the highest regular warning level, __/W4__, and remove the __/Wv__ option in your build as soon as possible.

These versions of the compiler introduced new warnings:

| Product | Compiler version number |
|-|-|
| Visual C++ 2002 | 13.00.9466 |
| Visual C++ 2003 | 13.10.3077 |
| Visual C++ 2005 | 14.00.50727.762 |
| Visual C++ 2008 | 15.00.21022.08 |
| Visual C++ 2010 | 16.00.40219.01 |
| Visual C++ 2012 | 17.00.51106.1 |
| Visual C++ 2013 | 18.00.21005.1 |
| Visual C++ 2015 RTM | 19.00.23026.0 |
| Visual C++ 2015 Update 1 | 19.00.23506.0 |
| Visual C++ 2015 Update 2 | 19.00.23918.0 |
| Visual C++ 2015 Update 3 | 19.00.24215.1 |
| Visual C++ 2017 RTM | 19.10.25017.0 |
| Visual C++ 2017 version 15.3 | 19.11.25506.0 |
| Visual C++ 2017 version 15.5 | 19.12.25830.0 |

You can specify only the major number, the major and minor numbers, or the major, minor, and build numbers to the __/Wv__ option. The compiler reports all warnings which match versions that begin with the specified number, and suppresses all warnings for versions greater than the specified number. For example, __/Wv:17__ reports all warnings introduced in or before any version of Visual Studio 2012, and suppresses all warnings introduced by any compiler from Visual Studio 2013 (version 18) or later. To suppress warnings introduced in Visual Studio 2015 update 2 and later, you can use __/Wv:19.00.23506__. Use __/Wv:19.11__ to report all warnings introduced in any version of Visual Studio before Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, but suppresses warnings introduced in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5 and later.

The following sections list the warnings introduced by each version of Visual C++ that you can suppress by using the __/Wv__ compiler option. The __/Wv__ option can't suppress warnings that are not listed, which predate the specified versions of the compiler.
