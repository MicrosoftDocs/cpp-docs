# Compiler Warnings by compiler version

The compiler can suppress warnings that were introduced after a version you specify by using the [`/Wv`](../../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md) compiler option. This option is useful for managing your build process when you introduce a new toolset version, and want to temporarily suppress new warnings. This option only suppresses warnings, not new error messages. Don't suppress all new warnings permanently! We recommend you always compile at the highest regular warning level, **`/W4`**, and remove the **`/Wv`** option in your build as soon as practical.

These versions of the compiler introduced new warnings:

You can specify only the major number, the major and minor numbers, or the major, minor, and build numbers to the **`/Wv`** option. The compiler reports all warnings that match versions that begin with the specified number. It suppresses all warnings for versions greater than the specified number. For example, **`/Wv:17`** reports warnings introduced in or before any version of Visual Studio 2012, and suppresses warnings introduced by any compiler from Visual Studio 2013 (version 18) or later. To suppress warnings introduced in Visual Studio 2015 update 2 and later, you can use **`/Wv:19.00.23506`**. Use **`/Wv:19.11`** to report the warnings introduced in any version of Visual Studio before Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, but suppress warnings introduced in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5 and later.

The following sections list the warnings introduced by each version of Visual C++ that you can suppress by using the **`/Wv`** compiler option. The **`/Wv`** option can't suppress warnings that aren't listed, which predate the specified versions of the compiler.
