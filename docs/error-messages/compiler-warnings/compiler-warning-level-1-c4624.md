# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4624
'derived class' : destructor was implicitly defined as deleted because a base class destructor is inaccessible or deleted  
  
 A destructor was not accessible or deleted in a base class and was therefore not generated for a derived class. Any attempt to create an object of this type on the stack will cause a compiler error.  
  
 The following sample generates C4624 and shows how to fix it:  
  
```  
// C4624.cpp  
// compile with: /W1 /c  
class B {  
// Uncomment the following line to fix.  
// public:  
   ~B();  
};  
  
class D : public B {};   // C4624 B's destructor not public  
```
