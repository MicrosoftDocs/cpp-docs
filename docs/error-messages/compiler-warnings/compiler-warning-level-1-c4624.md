# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4624

> 'derived class' : destructor was implicitly defined as deleted because a base class destructor is inaccessible or deleted

## Remarks

A destructor was not accessible or deleted in a base class and was therefore not generated for a derived class. Any attempt to create an object of this type on the stack will cause a compiler error.

## Example

The following example generates C4624 and shows how to fix it:

```cpp
// C4624.cpp
// compile with: /W1 /c
class B {
// Uncomment the following line to fix.
// public:
   ~B();
};

class D : public B {};   // C4624 B's destructor not public
```
