# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4650

> debugging information not in precompiled header; only global symbols from the header will be available

## Remarks

The precompiled header file was not compiled with Microsoft symbolic debugging information.

When linked, the resulting executable or dynamic-link library file will not include debugging information for local symbols contained in the precompiled header.

This warning can be avoided by recompiling the precompiled header file with the [/Zi](../../build/reference/z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md) command-line option.
