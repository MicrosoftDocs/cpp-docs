# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4258

> 'variable' : definition from the for loop is ignored; the definition from the enclosing scope is used"

## Remarks

Under [/Ze](../../build/reference/za-ze-disable-language-extensions.md) and [/Zc:forScope](../../build/reference/zc-forscope-force-conformance-in-for-loop-scope.md), variables defined in a [for](../../cpp/for-statement-cpp.md) loop go out of scope after the **`for`** loop ends. This warning occurs if a variable with the same name as the loop variable, but defined in the enclosing loop, is used again in the scope containing the **`for`** loop.

## Example

For example:

```cpp
// C4258.cpp
// compile with: /Zc:forScope /W1
int main()
{
   int i;
   {
      for (int i =0; i < 1; i++)
         ;
      i = 20;   // C4258 i (in for loop) has gone out of scope
   }
}
```
