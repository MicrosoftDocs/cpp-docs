# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4540
dynamic_cast used to convert to inaccessible or ambiguous base; run-time test will fail ('type1' to 'type2')  
  
 You used `dynamic_cast` to convert from one type to another. The compiler determined that the cast would always fail (return **NULL**) because a base class is inaccessible (`private`, for instance) or ambiguous (appears more than once in the class hierarchy, for instance).  
  
 The following shows an example of this warning. Class **B** is derived from class **A**. The program uses `dynamic_cast` to cast from class **B** (the derived class) to class **A**, which will always fail because class **B** is `private` and thus inaccessible. Changing the access of **A** to **public** will resolve the warning.  
  
```  
// C4540.cpp  
// compile with: /W1  
  
struct A {   
   virtual void g() {}  
};  
  
struct B : private A {  
   virtual void g() {}  
};  
  
int main() {  
   B b;  
   A * ap = dynamic_cast<A*>(&b);   // C4540  
}  
```
