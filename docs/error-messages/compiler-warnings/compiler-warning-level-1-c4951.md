# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4951

> '*function*' has been edited since profile data was collected, function profile data not used

## Remarks

A function has been edited in an input module to [/LTCG:PGUPDATE](../../build/reference/ltcg-link-time-code-generation.md), so that the profile data is now not valid. The input module was recompiled after **/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT** and has a function (*function*) with a different flow of control than was in the module at the time of the **/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT** operation.

This warning is informational. To resolve this warning, run **/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT**, redo all test runs, and run **/LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE**.

This warning would be replaced with an error if **/LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE** had been used.
