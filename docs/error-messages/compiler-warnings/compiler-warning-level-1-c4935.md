# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4935

assembly access specifier modified from 'access'

The assembly visibility of a type was modified. The compiler uses the last specifier that it encounters. For example, the assembly visibility of a forward declaration may be different from the assembly visibility of the class definition.

C4935 is only reachable using the obsolete compiler option **/clr:oldSyntax**.
