# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4526

> 'function' : static member function cannot override virtual function 'virtual function'override ignored, virtual function will be hidden

## Remarks

The static member function meets the criteria to override the virtual function, which makes the member function both virtual and static.

## Example

The following code generates C4526:

```cpp
// C4526.cpp
// compile with: /W1 /c
// C4526 expected
struct myStruct1 {
   virtual void __stdcall func( int ) = 0;
};

struct myStruct2: public myStruct1 {
   static void __stdcall func( int );
};
```

The following are possible fixes:

- If the function was intended to override the base class virtual function, remove the static specifier.

- If the function was intended to be a static member function, rename it so it doesn't conflict with the base class virtual function.
