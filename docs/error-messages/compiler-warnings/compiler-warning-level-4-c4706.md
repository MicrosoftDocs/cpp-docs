# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4706
assignment within conditional expression  
  
 The test value in a conditional expression was the result of an assignment.  
  
 An assignment has a value (the value on the left side of the assignment) that can be used legally in another expression, including a test expression.  
  
 The following sample generates C4706:  
  
```  
// C4706a.cpp  
// compile with: /W4  
int main()  
{  
   int a = 0, b = 0;  
   if ( a  = b ) // C4706  
   {  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 The warning will occur even if you double the parentheses around the test condition:  
  
```  
// C4706b.cpp  
// compile with: /W4  
int main()  
{  
   int a = 0, b = 0;  
   if ( ( a  =  b ) ) // C4706  
   {  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 If your intention is to test a relation and not to make an assignment, use the `==` operator. For example, the following line tests whether a and b are equal:  
  
```  
// C4706c.cpp  
// compile with: /W4  
int main()  
{  
   int a = 0, b = 0;  
   if ( a == b )  
   {  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 If you intend to make your test value the result of an assignment, test to ensure that the assignment is non-zero or not null. For example, the following code will not generate this warning:  
  
```  
// C4706d.cpp  
// compile with: /W4  
int main()  
{  
   int a = 0, b = 0;  
   if ( ( a = b ) != 0 )  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
