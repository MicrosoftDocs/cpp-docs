# Compiler Warning (level 1 and level 3) C4133

> '*expression*': incompatible types - from '*type1*' to '*type2*'

## Remarks

This warning is emitted when incompatible types are used in an expression. For example, doing arithmetic operations such as subtraction with different pointer types.

To avoid this warning, provide an appropriate type cast.
