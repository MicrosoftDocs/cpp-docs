# Compiler Warning C4368
cannot define 'member' as a member of managed 'type': mixed types are not supported  
  
 You cannot embed a native data member in a CLR type.  
  
 You can, however, declare a pointer to a native type and control its lifetime in the constructor and destructor and finalizer of your managed class. For more information see [Destructors and finalizers](../../dotnet/how-to-define-and-consume-classes-and-structs-cpp-cli.md#BKMK_Destructors_and_finalizers).  
  
 This warning is always issued as an error. Use the [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma to disable C4368.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C4368.  
  
```  
// C4368.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /c  
struct N {};  
ref struct O {};  
ref struct R {  
    R() : m_p( new N ) {}  
    ~R() { delete m_p; }  
  
   property N prop;   // C4368  
   int i[10];   // C4368  
  
   property O ^ prop2;   // OK  
   N * m_p;   // OK  
};  
```
