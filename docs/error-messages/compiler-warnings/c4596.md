# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4596

> '*name*': illegal qualified name in member declaration

## Remarks

A member declaration has an unexpected qualification. To resolve this warning, remove the qualification from the identifier.

This warning is off by default. You can use [/Wall](../../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md) or __/w__*N*__4596__ to enable it on the command line as a level *N* warning. Or, use [#pragma warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md)(*N*:4596) in your source file. For more information, see [Compiler warnings that are off by default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md). Some versions of the compiler only generate this warning under [/permissive-](../../build/reference/permissive-standards-conformance.md).

This warning is available starting in Visual Studio 2015 Update 3. Code that compiled without warnings in earlier versions of the compiler can now generate **C4596**. For information on how to disable warnings introduced in a particular compiler version or later, see [Compiler Warnings by compiler version](compiler-warnings-by-compiler-version.md).

## Example

This sample generates C4596, and shows a way to fix it:

```cpp
// C4596.cpp
// compile with: /w14596 /c

struct A {
    void A::f() { } // error C4596: illegal qualified name in member
                    // declaration.
                    // Remove redundant 'A::' to fix.
};
```
