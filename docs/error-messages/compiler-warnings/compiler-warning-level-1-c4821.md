> Unable to determine Unicode encoding type, please save the file with signature (BOM)

## Remarks

The compiler could not determine the encoding type for a file. To resolve this warning, save the file with a byte order marker. See [Manage Files with Encoding](/sql/ssms/solution/manage-files-with-encoding) for more information.
