# Compiler Warning (level 3) C4768

> `__declspec` attributes before linkage specification are ignored

## Remarks

The compiler warns if `__declspec(...)` is applied before the `extern "C"` linkage specification. Previously, the compiler would ignore the attribute, which could have runtime implications.

This warning is new in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, which left it off by default. It's enabled by default as a level 3 warning starting in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5. For information on how to disable warnings by compiler version, see [Compiler warnings by compiler version](compiler-warnings-by-compiler-version.md).

## Example

The following code produces warning C4768:

```cpp
__declspec(noinline) extern "C" HRESULT __stdcall // C4768: __declspec attributes before linkage specification are ignored
```

To fix the warning, put `extern "C"` first:

```cpp
extern "C" __declspec(noinline) HRESULT __stdcall
```
