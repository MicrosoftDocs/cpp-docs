# Compiler Warning (level 3) C4768

> `__declspec` attributes before linkage specification are ignored

The compiler warns if `__declspec(...)` is applied before the `extern "C"` linkage specification. Previously, the compiler would ignore the attribute, which could have runtime implications.

## Remarks

This warning is new in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, which left it off by default. It's enabled by default as a level 3 warning starting in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5. For information on how to disable warnings by compiler version, see [Compiler warnings by compiler version](compiler-warnings-by-compiler-version.md).

## Example

The following code produces warning C4768:

```cpp
__declspec(noinline) extern "C" HRESULT __stdcall // C4768: __declspec attributes before linkage specification are ignored
```

To fix the warning, put `extern "C"` first:

```cpp
extern "C" __declspec(noinline) HRESULT __stdcall
```
