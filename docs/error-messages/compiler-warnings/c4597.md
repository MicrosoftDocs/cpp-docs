# Compiler Warning (error) C4597

> undefined behavior: `offsetof` applied to a member of a virtual base

Using `offsetof(T, m)` where *`m`* refers to a static data member or a member function results in C4597.

## Remarks

This warning is new in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3. It's reported as an error by default. For information on how to disable warnings by compiler version, see [Compiler warnings by compiler version](compiler-warnings-by-compiler-version.md).

## Example

The following code produces error C4597:

```cpp
#include <cstddef>

struct A {
   int ten() { return 10; }
   static constexpr int two = 2;
};

constexpr auto off = offsetof(A, ten);  // C4597: undefined behavior: offsetof applied to member function 'A::ten'
constexpr auto off2 = offsetof(A, two); // C4597: undefined behavior: offsetof applied to static data member 'A::two'
```

This code is ill-formed and could potentially cause a crash at runtime. To fix the error, change the code: don't invoke `offsetof` on member functions or static data members. It's non-portable code that's disallowed by the C++ standard.
