[!INCLUDE[error-boilerplate](../../error-messages/includes/error-boilerplate.md)]

## Warning messages

| Warning | Message |
|--|--|
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5200 | *feature* '*feature-name*' requires compiler flag '*option-name*' |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5201 | a module declaration can appear only at the start of a translation unit unless a global module fragment is used |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5202 | a global module fragment can only contain preprocessor directives |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5203 | a parenthesized declarator name after '`explicit`' will be considered an explicit-specifier in C++20 |
| Compiler warning (level 3, off) C5204 | '*type-name*': class has virtual functions, but its trivial destructor is not virtual; instances of objects derived from this class may not be destructed correctly |
| Compiler warning (level 4) C5205 | delete of an abstract class '*type-name*' that has a non-virtual destructor results in undefined behavior |
| Compiler warning (level 3) C5206 | deduced return types for coroutines is a non-standard extension |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5207 | the simple requirement asserts the validity of expression '`e->id`'. Did you mean '`{ e } -> id`'? You can suppress the warning using '`{ e->id }`' |
| [Compiler warning (level 1, error) C5208](c5208.md) | unnamed class used in `typedef` name cannot declare members other than non-static data members, member enumerations, or member classes |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5209 | the C++20 syntax for an init-capture has changed to '`& ...opt identifier initializer`' |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5210 | '*name*' is not a valid header unit reference; ignoring |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5212 | '*name*' is not a valid named reference; treating as reference to file |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5213 | '*name*' named reference is treated as a named partition but the *module* name is not specified; treating as reference to file |
| Compiler warning (level 4, off) C5214 | applying '*modifier*' to an operand with a volatile qualified type is deprecated in C++20 |
| Compiler warning (level 4, off) C5215 | '*name*' a function parameter with a volatile qualified type is deprecated in C++20 |

| Compiler warning (level 2, off) C5219 | implicit conversion from '*type-1*' to '*type-2*', possible loss of data |
| Compiler warning (level 4, off) C5220 | '*name*': a non-static data member with a volatile qualified type no longer implies<br> that compiler generated copy/move constructors and copy/move assignment operators are not trivial |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5221 | `xfg::rename` is deprecated. |
| Compiler warning (level 3) C5222 | '*attribute-name*': all unscoped attribute names are reserved for future standardization |

| Compiler warning (level 4) C5229 | nonstandard extension, the hidden friend function '*function-name*' was found by name lookup which isn't allowed under `/permissive-`. |
| Compiler warning C5230 | nonstandard extension, '*identifier*' was resolved to '*symbol-1*' under `/permissive`. Under `/permissive-` it would resolve to '*symbol-2*'. |
| Compiler warning (level 3, error) C5231 | the expression '`co_await promise.final_suspend()`' must be non-throwing |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5232 | in C++20 this comparison calls '*name*' recursively |

| Compiler warning (level 1) C5242 | syntax error in pragma '*identifier*' |
| [Compiler warning (level 1, off) C5243](c5243.md) | '*type-name*': using incomplete class '*class-name*' can cause potential one definition rule violation due to ABI limitation |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5244 | '`#include <`*filename*`>`' in the purview of module '*module-name-1*' appears erroneous.  Consider moving that directive before the module declaration, or replace the textual inclusion with '`import <`*module-name-2*`>;`'. |

| Compiler warning (level 1, off) C5256 | '*enumeration*': a non-defining declaration of an enumeration with a fixed underlying type is only permitted as a standalone declaration |
| Compiler warning (level 1 and level 4) C5257 | '*enumeration*': enumeration was previously declared without a fixed underlying type |
| Compiler warning (level 4, off) C5258 | explicit capture of '*symbol*' is not required for this use |

| Compiler warning (level 1) C5260 | the constant variable '*variable-name*' has internal linkage in an included header file context, but external linkage in imported header unit context; consider declaring it 'inline' as well if it will be shared across translation units, or 'static' to express intent to use it local to this translation unit |
| Compiler warning (level 2) C5261 | no integer type can represent all enumerator values in enumeration '*enum-name*' |
| [Compiler warning (level 1, off) C5262](c5262.md) | implicit fall-through occurs here; are you missing a break statement? Use `[[fallthrough]]` when a `break` statement is intentionally omitted between cases |

| Compiler warning (level 1) C5283 | an attribute in this position requires at least '*language version*' |
| Compiler warning (level 4) C5284 | conversion from value '*value*' of type '*type 1*' to '*type 2*' requires a narrowing conversion |

| Compiler warning (level 1) C5287 | operands are different `enum` types '*type 1*' and '*type 2*'; use an explicit cast to silence this warning |
| Compiler warning (error) C5300 | '`#pragma omp atomic` *clause*': expression mismatch for lvalue being updated |

| Compiler warning (level 1) C5304 | a declaration designated by the using-declaration '*name1*' exported from this module has internal linkage and using such a name outside the module is ill-formed; consider declaring '*name2*' '`inline`' to use it outside of this module |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5305 | '*name*': an explicit instantiation declaration that follows an explicit instantiation definition is ignored |
| Compiler warning (level 1) C5306 | parameter array behavior change: overload '*identifier 1*' resolved to '*identifier 2*'; previously, it would have resolved to '*identifier 3*'. Use `/clr:ECMAParamArray` to revert to old behavior |
| Compiler warning (level 3) C5307 | '*function*': argument (*argument number*) converted from '*type 1*' to '*type 2*'. Missing '`L`' encoding-prefix for character literal? |
| Compiler warning (level 1, error) C5308 | Modifying reserved macro name '*macro name*' may cause undefined behavior |
