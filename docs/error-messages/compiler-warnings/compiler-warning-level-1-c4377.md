# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4377

> native types are private by default; -d1PrivateNativeTypes is deprecated

## Remarks

In previous releases, native types in assemblies were public by default, and an internal, undocumented compiler option (**/d1PrivateNativeTypes**) was used to make them private.

All types, native and CLR, are now private by default in an assembly, so **/d1PrivateNativeTypes** is no longer needed.

## Example

The following example generates C4377.

```cpp
// C4377.cpp
// compile with: /clr /d1PrivateNativeTypes /W1
// C4377 warning expected
int main() {}
```
