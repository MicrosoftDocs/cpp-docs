# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4711

> function 'function' selected for inline expansion

## Remarks

The compiler performed inlining on the given function, although it was not marked for inlining.

C4711 is enabled if [/Ob2](../../build/reference/ob-inline-function-expansion.md) is specified.

Inlining is performed at the compiler's discretion. This warning is informational.

This warning is off by default. To enable a warning, use [#pragma warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md). See [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md) for more information.
