# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4324

> '*structname*': structure was padded due to alignment specifier

Padding was added at the end of a structure because you specified an alignment specifier, such as [__declspec(align)](../../cpp/align-cpp.md).

For example, the following code generates C4324:

```cpp
// C4324.cpp
// compile with: /W4
struct __declspec(align(32)) A
{
   char a;
};   // C4324

int main()
{
}
```
