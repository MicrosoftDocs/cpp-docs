# Compiler Warning (level 3) C4800
'type' : forcing value to bool 'true' or 'false' (performance warning)  
  
 This warning is generated when a value that is not `bool` is assigned or coerced into type `bool`. Typically, this message is caused by assigning `int` variables to `bool` variables where the `int` variable contains only values **true** and **false**, and could be redeclared as type `bool`. If you cannot rewrite the expression to use type `bool`, then you can add "`!=0`" to the expression, which gives the expression type `bool`. Casting the expression to type `bool` will not disable the warning, which is by design.  
  
 The following sample generates C4800:  
  
```  
// C4800.cpp  
// compile with: /W3  
int main() {  
   int i = 0;  
  
   // try..  
   // bool i = 0;  
  
   bool j = i;   // C4800  
   j++;  
}  
```
