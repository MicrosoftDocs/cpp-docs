# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4910

'\<identifier>' : '__declspec(dllexport)' and 'extern' are incompatible on an explicit instantiation

The explicit template instantiation named *\<identifier>* is modified by both the `__declspec(dllexport)` and `extern` keywords. However, these keywords are mutually exclusive. The `__declspec(dllexport)` keyword means instantiate the template class, while the `extern` keyword means do not automatically instantiate the template class.
