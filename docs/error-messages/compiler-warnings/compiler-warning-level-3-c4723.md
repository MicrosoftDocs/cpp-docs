# Compiler Warning (level 3) C4723
potential divide by 0  
  
 The second operand in a divide operation evaluated to zero at compile time, giving undefined results.  
  
 This warning is issued only when using [/Og](../../build/reference/og-global-optimizations.md) or an optimization option that implies /Og.  
  
 The compiler may have generated the zero operand.
