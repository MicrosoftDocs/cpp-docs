# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4952
'function' : no profile data found in program database 'pgd_file'  
  
 When using [/LTCG:PGUPDATE](../../build/reference/ltcg-link-time-code-generation.md), the compiler detected an input module that was recompiled after `/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT` and has a new function (***function***) present.  
  
 This warning is informational. To resolve this warning, run `/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT`, redo all test runs, and run `/LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE`.  
  
 This warning would be replaced with an error if `/LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE` had been used.
