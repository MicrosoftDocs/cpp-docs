# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4431

> missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C no longer supports default-int

## Remarks

This error can be generated as a result of compiler conformance work that was done for Visual Studio 2005: Visual C++ no longer creates untyped identifiers as int by default. The type of an identifier must be specified explicitly.

This warning is off by default. See [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md) for more information.

## Example

The following sample generates C4431.

```c
// C4431.c
// compile with: /c /W4
#pragma warning(default:4431)
i;   // C4431
int i;   // OK
```
