# Compiler Warning (level 2) C4307
'operator' : integral constant overflow  
  
 The operator is used in an expression that results in an integer constant overflowing the space allocated for it. You may need to use a larger type for the constant. A **signed int** holds a smaller value than an `unsigned int` because the **signed int** uses one bit to represent the sign.  
  
 The following sample generates C4307:  
  
```  
// C4307.cpp  
// compile with: /W2  
int i = 2000000000 + 2000000000;   // C4307  
int j = (unsigned)2000000000 + 2000000000;   // OK  
  
int main()  
{  
}  
```
