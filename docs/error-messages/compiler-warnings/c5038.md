# Compiler Warning C5038

> data member '*member1*' will be initialized after data member '*member2*'  
> data member '*member*' will be initialized after base class '*base_class*'  

Class members are initialized in the order they are declared, not the order they appear in initializer lists. This warning indicates that the order of initialization is not the same as the declaration order of data members or base classes. This can lead to undefined runtime behavior if the initialization of one member in the list depends on the initialization of a member that is declared later.

This warning is new in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, and is off by default. Use [/Wall](../../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md) to enable all warnings that are off by default, or __/w__*n*__5038__ to enable C5038 as a level *n* warning. For more information, see [Compiler Warnings That Are Off By Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md). For information on how to disable warnings by compiler version, see [Compiler warnings by compiler version](compiler-warnings-by-compiler-version.md).

## Example

In the following example, Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 (with /Wall) raises "warning C5038: data member 'A::y' will be initialized after data member 'A::x'":

```cpp
struct A
{
    A(int a) : y(a), x(y) {} // C5938 Initialized in reverse, y reused
    int x;
    int y;
};
```

To fix this issue, arrange the intializer list to have the same order as the declarations. A similar warning is raised when one or both initializers refer to base class members.
