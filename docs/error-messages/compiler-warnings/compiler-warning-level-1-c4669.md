# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4669

> 'cast' : unsafe conversion: 'class' is a managed or WinRT type object

## Remarks

A cast contains a Windows Runtime or managed type. The compiler completes the cast by performing a bit-wise copy of one pointer to the other, but provides no other checking. To resolve this warning, do not cast classes containing managed members or Windows Runtime types.

## Example

The following sample generates C4669 and shows how to fix it:

```cpp
// C4669.cpp
// compile with: /clr /W1
ref struct A {
   int i;
   Object ^ pObj;   // remove the managed member to fix the warning
};

ref struct B {
   int j;
};

int main() {
   A ^ a = gcnew A;
   B ^ b = reinterpret_cast<B ^>(a);   // C4669
}
```
