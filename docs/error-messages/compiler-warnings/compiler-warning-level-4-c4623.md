# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4623
'`derived class`' : default constructor was implicitly defined as deleted because a base class default constructor is inaccessible or deleted  
  
 A constructor was not accessible in a base class and was not generated for the derived class. Any attempt to create an object of this type on the stack will cause a compiler error.  
  
 This warning is off by default. See [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md) for more information.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C4623.  
  
```  
// C4623.cpp  
// compile with: /W4  
#pragma warning(default : 4623)  
class B {  
   B();  
};  
  
class C {  
public:  
   C();  
};  
  
class D : public B {};   // C4623 - to fix, make B's constructor public  
class E : public C {};   // OK - class C constructor is public  
  
int main() {  
   // D d;  will cause an error  
}  
```
