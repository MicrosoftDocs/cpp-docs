# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4129
'character' : unrecognized character escape sequence  
  
 The `character` following a backslash (\\) in a character or string constant is not recognized as a valid escape sequence. The backslash is ignored and not printed. The character following the backslash is printed.  
  
 To print a single backslash, specify a double backslash (\\\\).  
  
 The C++ standard, in section 2.13.2 discusses escape sequences.  
  
 The following sample generates C4129:  
  
```  
// C4129.cpp  
// compile with: /W1  
int main() {  
   char array1[] = "\/709";   // C4129  
   char array2[] = "\n709";   // OK  
}  
```
