# Compiler Warning C5247

> section '*section-name*' is reserved for C++ dynamic initialization. Manually creating the section will interfere with C++ dynamic initialization and may lead to undefined behavior

## Remarks

The Microsoft C++ compiler uses reserved section names for internal implementation of features such as C++ dynamic initialization. If your code creates a section with the same name as a reserved section, such as `.CRT$XCU`, it interferes with the compiler. It may prevent other dynamic initialization and cause undefined behavior.

To resolve this error, don't create a section that uses the reserved name.

There's no C++ standard conforming way to initialize variables across translation units, in a specific relative order with compiler generated dynamic initializers. Ways to force initialization before or after compiler generated C++ dynamic initializers are implementation-specific. For more information on Microsoft-specific implementation details, see [CRT initialization](../../c-runtime-library/crt-initialization.md).

Compiler Warning C5247 is new in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.11. It's off by default. For more information on how to enable this warning, see [Compiler warnings that are off by default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md).

## Example

Code that tries to emulate the C++ compiler behavior for dynamic initialization often takes this form:

```cpp
void f();
typedef void (*type)();

#pragma section(".CRT$XCU", read)
__declspec(allocate(".CRT$XCU")) type i = f;
```

This code creates a section using a reserved name, `.CRT$XCU`. It stops the compiler from creating the section with the expected properties, and it may skip other initializations. The variable `i` placed in the section is a regular variable, and isn't considered an initializer by the compiler. The compiler may optimize `i` away. The relative order when `f` gets called compared to other dynamic initializers is unspecified.

If initialization order isn't important, you can use this pattern to dynamically initialize a variable at startup:

```cpp
void f();

struct init_helper {
    init_helper() { f(); }
};

init_helper i;
```
