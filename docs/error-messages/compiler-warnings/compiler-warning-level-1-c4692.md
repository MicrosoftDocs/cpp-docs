# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4692
'function': signature of non-private member contains assembly private native type 'native_type'  
  
 A type that is visible outside the assembly contains a member function whose signature contains a native type that is not visible outside the assembly. Therefore, the member function should not be called if its containing type is instantiated outside the assembly.  
  
 For more information, see [Type visibility](../../dotnet/how-to-define-and-consume-classes-and-structs-cpp-cli.md#BKMK_Type_visibility).  
  
 This warning is off by default. For more information, see [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C4692.  
  
```  
// C4692.cpp  
// compile with: /W1 /c /clr  
#pragma warning(default:4692)  
class Private_Native_Class {};  
public class Public_Native_Class {};  
public ref class Public_Ref_Class {  
public:  
   void Test(Private_Native_Class *) {}   // C4692  
   void Test2(Public_Native_Class *) {}   // OK  
};  
```
