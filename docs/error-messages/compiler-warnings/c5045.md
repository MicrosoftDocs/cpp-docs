# Compiler Warning C5045

> Compiler will insert Spectre mitigation for memory load if /Qspectre switch specified

## Remarks

Warning C5045 lets you see what patterns in your code cause a Spectre mitigation, such as an LFENCE, to be inserted when the [/Qspectre](../../build/reference/qspectre.md) compiler option is specified. This lets you identify which code files are affected by the security issue. This warning is purely informational: the mitigation is not inserted until you recompile using the **/Qspectre** switch. The functionality of C5045 is independent of the **/Qspectre** switch, so you can use them both in the same compilation.

This warning is new in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7, and is off by default. Use [/Wall](../../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md) to enable all warnings that are off by default, or __/w__*n*__5045__ to enable C5045 as a level *n* warning. In the IDE, the default warning level is **/W3** and this warning can be enabled in the project **Property Pages** dialog. Open **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Command Line** and in the **Additional options** box, add */w35045*, then choose **OK**. For more information, see [Compiler warnings that are off by default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md). For information on how to disable warnings by compiler version, see [Compiler warnings by compiler version](compiler-warnings-by-compiler-version.md).

## Example

The following example raises warning C5045 when compiled by Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 with the **/Wall** or the **/w35045** and **/W3** options:

```cpp
// C5045.cpp
// Compile with: cl /EHsc /W3 /w35045 C5045.cpp

int G, G1, G2;

__forceinline
int * bar(int **p, int i)
{
    return p[i];
}

__forceinline
void bar1(int ** p, int i)
{
    if (i < G1) {
        auto x = p[i]; // C5045: mitigation here
        G = *x;
    }
}

__forceinline
void foo(int * p)
{
    G = *p;
}

void baz(int ** p, int i)
{
    if (i < G1) {
        foo(bar(p, i + G2));
    }
    bar1(p, i);
}

int main() { }
```

The compiler output when the warning is enabled looks something like this:

```Output
C:\Users\username\source\repos\C5045>cl /W3 /w35045 C5045.cpp

C5045.cpp
c:\users\username\source\repos\c5045\c5045.cpp(16) : warning C5045: Compiler will insert Spectre mitigation for memory load if /Qspectre switch specified
c:\users\username\source\repos\c5045\c5045.cpp(15) : note: index 'i' range checked by comparison on this line

C5045.obj
```

The warning messages show that a mitigation would have been inserted on line 16. It also notes that the mitigation is needed because the index i on line 15 feeds the memory load on line 17. The speculation is done across bar and bar1 but the mitigation is effective when placed at line 16.
