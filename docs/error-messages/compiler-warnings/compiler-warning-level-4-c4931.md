# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4931
we are assuming the type library was built for number-bit pointers  
  
 Explicit information was not supplied with the **ptrsize** attribute of the [#import](../../preprocessor/hash-import-directive-cpp.md) directive; the compiler concluded that pointer size of the type library is ***number***.  
  
 This warning is off by default. See [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md) for more information.
