# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4010
single-line comment contains line-continuation character  
  
 A single-line comment, which is introduced by //, contains a backslash (\\) that serves as a line-continuation character. The compiler considers the next line to be a continuation and treats it as a comment.  
  
 Some syntax-directed editors do not indicate the line following the continuation character as a comment. Ignore syntax coloring on any lines that cause this warning.  
  
 The following sample generates C4010:  
  
```  
// C4010.cpp  
// compile with: /WX  
int main() {  
   // the next line is also a comment because of the backslash \  
   int a = 3; // C4010  
   a++;  
}  
```
