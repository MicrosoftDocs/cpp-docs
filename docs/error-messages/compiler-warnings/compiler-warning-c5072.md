# Compiler Warning (level 1) C5072

> ASAN enabled without debug information emission. Enable debug info for better ASAN error reporting

## Remarks

This warning occurs when you compile with [Address Sanitizer](../../sanitizers/asan.md) (ASAN) turned on, but you don't also instruct the compiler to emit debug info. ASAN uses debug info to provide better diagnostics.

## Example

The following command line generates warning `C5072`:

```cpp
 cl /fsanitize=address /EHsc test.cpp
```

To fix it, have the compiler generate debug information by using a switch like [`/Zi`](../../build/reference/z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md#zi) or [`/Z7`](../../build/reference/z7-zi-zi-debug-information-format.md#z7), like this: `cl /fsanitize=address /EHsc /Zi test.cpp`
