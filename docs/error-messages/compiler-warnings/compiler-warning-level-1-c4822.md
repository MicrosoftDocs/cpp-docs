# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4822

> 'member' : local class member function does not have a body

## Remarks

A local class member function was declared but not defined in the class. To use a local class member function, you must define it in the class. You can't declare it in class and define it out of class.

Any out-of-class definition for a local class member function is an error.

In Visual Studio 2019 and later, C4822 is an [off-by-default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md) warning.

## Example

The following sample generates C4822:

```cpp
// C4822.cpp
// compile with: /W1
int main() {
   struct C {
      void func1(int);   // C4822
      // try the following line instead
      // void func1(int){}
  };
}
```
