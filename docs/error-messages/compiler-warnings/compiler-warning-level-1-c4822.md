# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4822
'member' : local class member function does not have a body  
  
 A local class member function was declared but not defined in class. To use a local class member function, you must define it in the class. You cannot declare it in class and define it out of class.  
  
 Any out-of-class definition for a local class member function will be an error.  
  
 The following sample generates C4822:  
  
```  
// C4822.cpp  
// compile with: /W1  
int main() {  
   struct C {  
      void func1(int);   // C4822  
      // try the following line instead  
      // void func1(int){}  
  };  
}  
```
