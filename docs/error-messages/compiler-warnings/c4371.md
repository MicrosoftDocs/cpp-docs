# Compiler Warning (level 3) C4371

> '*classname*': layout of class may have changed from a previous version of the compiler due to better packing of member '*member*'

## Remarks

Warning C4371 tells you that the layout created by the current compiler may be different from the layout generated by previous versions of the compiler. This difference may be significant for serialization operations or operating system interfaces that rely on a particular memory layout. In most other cases, this warning is safe to ignore.

Warning C4371 is off by default. For more information, see [Compiler Warnings That Are Off By Default](../../preprocessor/compiler-warnings-that-are-off-by-default.md).
