# Compiler Warning (level 3) C4543

> Injected text suppressed by attribute 'no_injected_text'

## Remarks

The [no_injected_text](../../windows/attributes/no-injected-text.md) attribute appeared in source code, which means the compiler will prevent attributes from injecting code.

This warning is to remind you that attributes will not be able to inject code.
