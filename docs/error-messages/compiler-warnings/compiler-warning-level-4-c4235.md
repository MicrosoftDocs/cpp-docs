# Compiler Warning (level 1, Error) C4235

> nonstandard extension used: '*keyword*' keyword not supported on this architecture

## Remarks

The compiler doesn't support the keyword you used on the architecture your build is targeting.

This warning is always issued as an error. Use the [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma to disable.
