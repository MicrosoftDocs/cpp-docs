# Compiler Warning C4950

> 'type_or_member' : marked as obsolete

## Remarks

A member or type was marked as obsolete with the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> attribute.

C4950 is always issued as an error. You can turn off this warning by using the [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma directive or the [/wd](../../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md) compiler option.

## Example

The following example generates C4950:

```cpp
// C4950.cpp
// compile with: /clr
using namespace System;

// Any reference to Func3 should generate an error with message
[System::ObsoleteAttribute("Will be removed in next version", true)]
Int32 Func3(Int32 a, Int32 b) {
   return (a + b);
}

int main() {
   Int32 MyInt3 = ::Func3(2, 2);   // C4950
}
```
