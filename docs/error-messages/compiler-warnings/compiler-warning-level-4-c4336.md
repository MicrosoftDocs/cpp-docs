# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4336
import cross-referenced type library 'type_lib1' before importing 'type_lib2'  
  
 A type library was referenced with the [#import](../../preprocessor/hash-import-directive-cpp.md) directive. However, the type library contained a reference to another type library that was not referenced with `#import`. This other .tlb file was found by the compiler.  
  
 Given two type libraries on disk created from the following two files (compiled with midl.exe):  
  
```  
// c4336a.idl  
[uuid("f87070ba-c6d9-405c-a8e4-8cd9ca25c12b")]  
library c4336aLib  
{  
   [uuid("f87070ba-c6d9-405c-a8e4-8cd9ca25c12c")]  
   enum E_C4336  
   {  
      one, two, three  
   };  
};  
```  
  
 The second type library:  
  
```  
// c4336b.idl  
[uuid("f87070ba-c6d9-405c-a8e4-8cd9ca25c12d")]  
library C4336bLib  
{  
   importlib ("c4336a.tlb");  
   [uuid("f87070ba-c6d9-405c-a8e4-8cd9ca25c12e")]  
   struct S_C4336  
   {  
      enum E_C4336 e;  
   };  
};  
```  
  
 The following sample generates C4336:  
  
```  
// C4336.cpp  
// compile with: /W4 /LD  
// #import "C4336a.tlb"  
#import "C4336b.tlb"   // C4336, uncomment previous line to resolve  
```
