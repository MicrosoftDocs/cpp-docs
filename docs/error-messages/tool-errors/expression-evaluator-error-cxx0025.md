# Expression Evaluator Error CXX0025

operator needs struct/union

An operator that takes an expression of **`struct`** or **`union`** type was applied to an expression that is not a **`struct`** or **`union`**.

Components of class, structure, or union variables must have a fully qualified name. Components cannot be entered without full specification.

This error is identical to CAN0025.
