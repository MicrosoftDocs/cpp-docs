# Linker Tools Warning LNK4247
entry point 'decorated_function_name' already has a thread attribute; 'attribute' ignored  
  
 An entry point, specified with [/ENTRY (Entry-Point Symbol)](../../build/reference/entry-entry-point-symbol.md), had a threading attribute, but [/CLRTHREADATTRIBUTE (Set CLR Thread Attribute)](../../build/reference/clrthreadattribute-set-clr-thread-attribute.md) was also specified, with a different threading model.  
  
 The linker ignored the value specified with /CLRTHREADATTRIBUTE.  
  
 To resolve this warning:  
  
-   Remove /CLRTHREADATTRIBUTE from your build.  
  
-   Remove attribute from your source code file.  
  
-   Remove both the attribute from source and /CLRTHREADATTRIBUTE from your build, and accept the default CLR threading model.  
  
-   Change the value passed to /CLRTHREADATTRIBUTE, such that, it agrees with the attribute in source.  
  
-   Change the attribute in source, such that, it agrees with the value passed to /CLRTHREADATTRIBUTE.  
  
 The following sample generates LNK4247  
  
```  
// LNK4247.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /c  
// post-build command: link /CLRTHREADATTRIBUTE:STA LNK4247.obj /entry:functionTitle /SUBSYSTEM:Console  
 [System::MTAThreadAttribute]  
void functionTitle (){}  
```
