# Resource Compiler Warning RC4005
'identifier' : macro redefinition  
  
 The identifier is defined twice. The compiler used the second macro definition.  
  
 This warning can be caused by defining a macro on the command line and in the code with a `#define` directive. It also can be caused by macros imported from include files.  
  
 To eliminate the warning, either remove one of the definitions or use an `#undef` directive before the second definition.
