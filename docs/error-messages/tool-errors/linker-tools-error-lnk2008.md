# Linker Tools Error LNK2008
Fixup target is not aligned 'symbol_name'  
  
 LINK found a fixup target in your object file that was not aligned properly.  
  
 This error can be caused by custom secton alignment (for example, #pragma [pack](../../preprocessor/pack.md)), [align](../../cpp/align-cpp.md) modifier, or by using assembly language code that modifies secton alignment.  
  
 If your code does not use any of the above, this may be caused by the compiler.
