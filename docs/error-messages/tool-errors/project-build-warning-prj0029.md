# Project Build Warning PRJ0029
The 'Outputs' property for the project-level custom build step is not set. The custom build step will be skipped.  
  
 A custom build step was not executed because no output was specified.  
  
 To resolve this error, do one the following:  
  
-   Exclude the custom build step from the build.  
  
-   Add an output.  
  
-   Delete the contents of the custom build step's command.
