# Expression Evaluator Error CXX0036
bad context {...} specification  
  
 This message can be generated by any of several errors in the use of the context operator (**{}**).  
  
-   The syntax of the context operator (**{}**) was given incorrectly.  
  
     The syntax of the context operator is:  
  
     {*function*,*module*,*dll*}*expression*  
  
     This specifies the context of *expression*. The context operator has the same precedence and usage as a type cast.  
  
     Trailing commas can be omitted. If any of *function*, *module*, or *dll* contains a literal comma, you must enclose the entire name in parentheses.  
  
-   The function name was spelled incorrectly, or does not exist in the specified module or dynamic-link library.  
  
     Because C is a case-sensitive language, *function* must be given in the exact case as it is defined in the source.  
  
-   The module or DLL could not be found.  
  
     Check the full path name of the specified module or DLL.  
  
 This error is identical to CAN0036.
