# Project Build Error PRJ0013

> System resource could be critically low. Unable to create a pipe required to launch a build.

This error indicates that system resources are low. To resolve this error, decrease system resource usage by other processes/applications.

This error can also occur if your security level is insufficient to create pipes (see [CreatePipe](/windows/win32/api/namedpipeapi/nf-namedpipeapi-createpipe)).
