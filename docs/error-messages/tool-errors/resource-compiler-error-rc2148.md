# Resource Compiler Error RC2148

> SUBLANGUAGE ID too large

## Remarks

The SUBLANGUAGE ID value was out of range.

The **LANGUAGE** statement must use the following syntax:

**LANGUAGE** *primary_language_ID*,*secondary_language_ID*

Valid SUBLANGUAGE IDs are defined as **SUBLANG_** constants in the WINNT.h file.
