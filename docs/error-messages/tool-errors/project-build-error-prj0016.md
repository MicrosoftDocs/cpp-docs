# Project Build Error PRJ0016

> The user's security settings prevent the process from being created. These settings are required for building.

## Remarks

You are logged in as a user who does not have permissions to create processes using a process. You must change the permission levels for this user account, or contact your account administrator.

This error can also occur if the following registry key is set:

\\\HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\RestrictRun

To resolve this error, delete the RestrictRun key. If this registry key is needed, append **vcspawn.exe** to the list of entries in the key.

Another cause for this error is that your Policy Setting does not include VCSpawn.exe under the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\RestrictRun as an allowed Window program for this user account.

For additional information, see [Adhering to System Policy Settings](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/Policy/adhering-to-system-policy-settings), in the section on "Run only allowed Windows applications".
