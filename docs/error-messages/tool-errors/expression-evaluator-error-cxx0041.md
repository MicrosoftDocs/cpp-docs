# Expression Evaluator Error CXX0041

> class element must be static member or member function

## Remarks

A nonstatic member of a class (or structure or union) was used without specifying which instantiation of the class to use.

Only static data members or member functions can be used without specifying an instantiation.

This error is identical to CAN0041.
