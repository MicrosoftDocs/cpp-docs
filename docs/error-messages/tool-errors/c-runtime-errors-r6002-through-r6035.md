# C Runtime errors (Rxxxx)

The C Runtime library (CRT) may report a runtime error when your app is loaded or running. Even though each message refers to the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime library, it doesn't mean there's a bug in the library. These errors indicate either a bug in your app's code, or a condition that the runtime library can't handle, such as low memory. End users of your app may see these errors unless your write your app to prevent them, or to capture the errors and present a friendly error message to your users instead.

| [C Runtime Error R6008](c-runtime-error-r6008.md) | not enough space for arguments |
| [C Runtime Error R6009](c-runtime-error-r6009.md) | not enough space for environment |
| [C Runtime Error R6016](c-runtime-error-r6016.md) | not enough space for thread data |
| [C Runtime Error R6017](c-runtime-error-r6017.md) | unexpected multithread lock error |
| [C Runtime Error R6018](c-runtime-error-r6018.md) | unexpected heap error |
| [C Runtime Error R6019](c-runtime-error-r6019.md) | unable to open console device |
| [C Runtime Error R6024](c-runtime-error-r6024.md) | not enough space for _onexit/atexit table |
| [C Runtime Error R6025](c-runtime-error-r6025.md) | pure virtual function call |
| [C Runtime Error R6028](c-runtime-error-r6028.md) | unable to initialize heap |
