# NMAKE Fatal Error U1035

> syntax error : expected ':' or '=' separator

## Remarks

Either a colon (**:**) or an equal sign (**=**) was expected.

### To fix by checking the following possible causes

1. A colon did not follow a target.

1. A colon and no space (such as a:) followed a single-letter target. NMAKE interpreted it as a drive specification.

1. A colon did not follow an inference rule.

1. A macro definition was not followed by an equal sign.

1. A character followed a backslash (**\\**) that was used to continue a command to a new line.

1. A string appeared that did not follow any NMAKE syntax rule.

1. The makefile was formatted by a word processor.
