# Linker Tools Warning LNK4222

> exported symbol 'symbol' should not be assigned an ordinal

## Remarks

The following symbols should not be exported by ordinal:

- `DllCanUnloadNow`

- `DllGetClassObject`

- `DllGetClassFactoryFromClassString`

- `DllInstall`

- `DllRegisterServer`

- `DllRegisterServerEx`

- `DllUnregisterServer`

These functions are always located by name, using `GetProcAddress`. The linker warns about this kind of export is because it could result in a larger image. This could happen if the range of your ordinal exports is large with relatively few exports. For example,

```
EXPORTS
   DllGetClassObject   @1
   MyOtherAPI      @100
```

will require 100 slots in the export address table with 98 of them (2-99) just filler. On the other hand,

```
EXPORTS
   DllGetClassObject
   MyOtherAPI      @100
```

will require two slots. (Be aware that you can also export with the [/EXPORT](../../build/reference/export-exports-a-function.md) linker option.)
