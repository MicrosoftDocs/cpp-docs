# Expression Evaluator Error CXX0020

> operand types bad for this operation

## Remarks

An operator was applied to an expression with an invalid type for that operator.

For example, it is not valid to take the address of a register or subscript an array with a floating-point expression.

This error is identical to CAN0020.
