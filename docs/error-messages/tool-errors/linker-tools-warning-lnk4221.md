# Linker Tools Warning LNK4221

> This object file does not define any previously undefined public symbols, so it will not be used by any link operation that consumes this library

## Example

Consider the following two code snippets, `a.cpp`:

```cpp
// a.cpp
#include <atlbase.h>
```

And `b.cpp`:

```cpp
// b.cpp
#include <atlbase.h>
int function()
{
   return 0;
}
```

To compile the files and create two object files, run **`cl /c a.cpp b.cpp`** at a command prompt. If you link the object files by running **`link /lib /out:test.lib a.obj b.obj`**, you'll receive the LNK4221 warning. If you link the objects by running **`link /lib /out:test.lib b.obj a.obj`**, you won't receive a warning.

No warning is issued in the second scenario because the linker operates in a last-in first-out (LIFO) manner. In the first scenario, `b.obj` is processed before `a.obj`, and `a.obj` has no new symbols to add. By instructing the linker to process `a.obj` first, you can avoid the warning.

A common cause of this error is when two source files specify the option [`/Yc` (Create Precompiled Header File)](../../build/reference/yc-create-precompiled-header-file.md) with the same header file name specified in the **Precompiled Header** field. A common cause of this problem deals with *`pch.h`* since, by default, *`pch.cpp`* includes *`pch.h`* and doesn't add any new symbols. If another source file includes *`pch.h`* with **`/Yc`** and the associated `.obj` file is processed before `pch.obj`, the linker will throw LNK4221.

A common cause of this error is when two source files specify the option [`/Yc` (Create Precompiled Header File)](../../build/reference/yc-create-precompiled-header-file.md) with the same header file name specified in the **Precompiled Header** field. A common cause of this problem deals with *`stdafx.h`* since, by default, *`stdafx.cpp`* includes *`stdafx.h`* and doesn't add any new symbols. If another source file includes *`stdafx.h`* with **`/Yc`** and the associated `.obj` file is processed before `stdafx.obj`, the linker will throw LNK4221.

One way to resolve this problem is to make sure that for each precompiled header, there's only one source file that includes it with **`/Yc`**. All other source files must use precompiled headers. For more information about how to change this setting, see [`/Yu` (Use Precompiled Header File)](../../build/reference/yu-use-precompiled-header-file.md).
