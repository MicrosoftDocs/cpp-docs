# NMAKE Fatal Error U1033

> syntax error : 'string' unexpected

## Remarks

The string is not part of the valid syntax for a makefile.

### To fix by checking the following possible causes

1. If the closing set of angle brackets (**<<**) for an inline file are not at the beginning of a line, the following error occurs:

    ```
    syntax error : 'EOF' unexpected
    ```

1. If a macro definition in the makefile contained an equal sign (**=**) without a preceding name or if the name being defined is a macro that expands to nothing, the following error occurs:

    ```
    syntax error : '=' unexpected
    ```

1. If the semicolon (**;**) in a comment line in TOOLS.INI is not at the beginning of the line, the following error occurs:

    ```
    syntax error : ';' unexpected
    ```

1. If the makefile has been formatted by a word processor, the following error can occur:

    ```
    syntax error : ':' unexpected
    ```
