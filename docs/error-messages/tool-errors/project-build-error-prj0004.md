# Project Build Error PRJ0004
Could not generate command line for the 'tool' tool.  
  
 One or more properties were specified in such a way as to make the syntax of the call to ***tool*** illegal:  
  
-   You may have specified badly formed or unknown macros.  
  
-   Your computer may be low on free disk space.  
  
 You may want to review the settings for the tool by looking at the [Command Line property page](../../ide/command-line-property-pages.md).
