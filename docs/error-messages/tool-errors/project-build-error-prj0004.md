# Project Build Error PRJ0004

> Could not generate command line for the '*tool*' tool.

One or more properties were specified in such a way as to make the syntax of the call to *tool* illegal:

- You may have specified badly formed or unknown macros.

- Your computer may be low on free disk space.

You may want to review the settings for the tool by looking at the [Command Line property page](../../build/reference/command-line-property-pages.md).
