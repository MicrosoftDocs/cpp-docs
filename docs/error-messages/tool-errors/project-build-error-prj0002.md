# Project Build Error PRJ0002

> error result returned from '*command line*'.

## Remarks

A command, *command line*, which was formed from user input in the **Property Pages** dialog box, returned an error code but no information will appear in the **Output** window.

The resolution to this error depends on which tool generated the error. For MIDL, you will get an idea of what went wrong if /o (Redirect Output) is defined.

A batch file, such as a custom build step or build event, that is not informative about failure conditions could also be the reason for this error.
