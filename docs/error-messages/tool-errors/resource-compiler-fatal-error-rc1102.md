# Resource Compiler Fatal Error RC1102

> internal error : too many arguments to RCPP

## Remarks

Too many arguments were passed to the Resource Compiler preprocessor. Reduce the number of symbols defined with the Define Symbols (/d) option by defining them in your source. This error can also be caused by specifying too many include file search paths using the Include Search Path option (/i).
