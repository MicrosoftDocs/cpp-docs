# Name Decoration

Name decoration usually refers to C++ naming conventions, but can apply to a number of C cases as well. By default, C++ uses the function name, parameters, and return type to create a linker name for the function. Consider the following function:

```
void CALLTYPE test(void)  
```

The following table shows the linker name for various calling conventions.

|Calling convention|extern "C" or .c file|.cpp, .cxx or /TP|
|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
|C naming convention (`__cdecl`)|`_test`|`?test@@ZAXXZ`|
|Fastcall naming convention (`__fastcall`)|`@test@0`|`?test@@YIXXZ`|
|Standard Call naming convention (`__stdcall`)|`_test@0`|`?test@@YGXXZ`|
|Vectorcall naming convention (`__vectorcall`)|`test@@0`|`?test@@YQXXZ`|

Use extern "C" to call a C function from C++. Extern "C" forces use of the C naming convention for non-class C++ functions. Be aware of compiler switches **/Tc** or **/Tp**, which tell the compiler to ignore the filename extension and compile the file as C or C++, respectively. These options may cause names you do not expect.

Having function prototypes that have mismatched parameters can also cause this error. Name decoration incorporates the parameters of a function into the final decorated function name. Calling a function with the parameter types that do not match those in the function declaration may also cause LNK2001.

There is currently no standard for C++ naming between compiler vendors or even between different versions of a compiler. Therefore linking object files compiled with other compilers may not produce the same naming scheme and thus causes unresolved externals.
