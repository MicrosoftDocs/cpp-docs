# BSCMAKE Error BK1517

> source file for sbrfile compiled with both /Yc and /Yu

The .sbr file refers to itself. It was probably recompiled with /Yu after compiling with /Yc. Reset the compiler option for the source file to /Yc, then select **Rebuild** to generate new .sbr files. Do not recompile the source file with /Yu.
