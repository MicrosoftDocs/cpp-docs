# Project Build Error PRJ0008

> Could not delete file 'file'.

## Remarks

**Make sure that the file is not open by another process and is not write-protected.**

During a rebuild or clean, Visual C++ deletes all known intermediate and output files for the build, as well as any files that meet the wildcard specifications in the **Extensions to Delete on Clean** property in the [General Configuration Settings Property Page](../../build/reference/general-property-page-project.md).

You will see this error if Visual C++ is not able to delete a file. To resolve the error, make the file and its directory writeable for the user doing the build.
