# Project Build Error PRJ0003

> Error spawning '*command line*'.

## Remarks

The *command line* command formed from input in the **Property Pages** dialog box returned an error code, but no information appears in the **Output** window.

Possible reasons for this error include:

- Low system resources. Close some applications to resolve this.

- Insufficient security privileges. Verify that you have sufficient security privileges.

- The executable paths specified in **VC++ Directories** do not include the path for the tool that you are attempting to run. For information, see [Set compiler and build properties](../../build/working-with-project-properties.md)

- For makefile projects, you are missing a command to run on either **Build Command Line** or **Rebuild Command Line**.

- Your project depends on ATL Server. Beginning in Visual Studio 2008, ATL Server is no longer included as part of Visual Studio.
