# NMAKE Warning U4004
too many rules for target 'targetname'  
  
 More than one description block was specified for the given target using single colons (**:**) as separators. NMAKE executed the commands in the first description block and ignored later blocks.  
  
 To specify the same target in multiple dependencies, use double colons (`::`) as the separator in each dependency line.
