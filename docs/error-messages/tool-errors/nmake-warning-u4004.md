# NMAKE Warning U4004

> too many rules for target 'targetname'

More than one description block was specified for the given target using single colons (**:**) as separators. NMAKE executed the commands in the first description block and ignored later blocks.

To specify the same target in multiple dependencies, use double colons (`::`) as the separator in each dependency line.
