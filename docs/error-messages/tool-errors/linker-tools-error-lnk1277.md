# Linker Tools Error LNK1277
object record not found in pgd (filename)  
  
 When using [/LTCG:PGOPTIMZE](../../build/reference/ltcg-link-time-code-generation.md), the path of one of the input .lib, def, or .obj files was different from the path on which they were found during /LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT. This may be explained by a change in the LIB environment variable after /LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT. The full path to the input files is stored in the .pgd file.  
  
 /LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE requires that the inputs be identical to the /LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT phase.  
  
 To resolve this warning, do one of the following:  
  
-   Run /LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT, redo all test runs, and run /LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE.  
  
-   Change the LIB environment variable to what it was when you ran /LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT.  
  
 It is not recommended that you work around LNK1277 by using /LTCG:PGUPDATE.
