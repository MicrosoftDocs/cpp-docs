# Resource Compiler Warning RC4093
unescaped newline in character constant in inactive code  
  
 The constant expression of an `#if`, `#elif`, **#ifdef**, or **#ifndef** preprocessor directive evaluated to zero, making the code that follows inactive. Within that inactive code, a newline character appeared within a set of single or double quotation marks.  
  
 All text until the next double quotation mark was considered to be within a character constant.
