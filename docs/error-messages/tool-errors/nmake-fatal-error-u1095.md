# NMAKE Fatal Error U1095

> expanded command line 'commandline' too long

## Remarks

After macro expansion, the given command line exceeded the limit on length of command lines for the operating system.

MS-DOS permits up to 128 characters on a command line.

If the command is for a program that can accept command-line input from a file, change the command and supply input from either a file on disk or an inline file. For example, LINK and LIB accept input from a response file.
