# Project Build Error PRJ0009
Build log could not be opened for writing.  
  
 **Make sure that the file is not open by another process and is not write-protected.**  
  
 After setting the **Build Logging** property to **Yes** and performing a build or rebuild, Visual C++ was unable to open the build log in exclusive mode.  
  
 Inspect the **Build Logging** setting by opening the **Options** dialog box (on the **Tools** menu, click **Options** command) and then selecting **VC++ Build** in the **Projects** folder. The build file is called BuildLog.htm and is written to the intermediate directory $(IntDir).  
  
 Possible reasons for this error:  
  
-   You are running two processes of Visual C++ and trying to build the same configuration of the same project in both simultaneously.  
  
-   The build log file is opened in a process that locks the file.  
  
-   The user does not have permission to create a file.  
  
-   The current user does not have write access to the file BuildLog.htm.
