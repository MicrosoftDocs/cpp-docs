# Expression Evaluator Error CXX0029

> not struct pointer

## Remarks

The member-selection operator (**->**) was applied to an expression that is not a pointer to a structure.

Check that the entire expression is parenthesized correctly, or type cast the address expression to the appropriate structure pointer type.

This error is identical to CAN0029.
