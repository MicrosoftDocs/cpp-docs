# Expression Evaluator Error CXX0029
not struct pointer  
  
 The member-selection operator (**->**) was applied to an expression that is not a pointer to a structure.  
  
 Check that the entire expression is parenthesized correctly, or type cast the address expression to the appropriate structure pointer type.  
  
 This error is identical to CAN0029.
