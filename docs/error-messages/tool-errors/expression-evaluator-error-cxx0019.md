# Expression Evaluator Error CXX0019

> bad type cast

The C expression evaluator cannot perform the type cast as written.

This error is identical to CAN0019.

### To fix by checking the following possible causes

1. The specified type is unknown.

1. There were too many levels of pointer types. For example, the type cast

    ```
    (char **)h_message
    ```

   cannot be evaluated by the C expression evaluator.
