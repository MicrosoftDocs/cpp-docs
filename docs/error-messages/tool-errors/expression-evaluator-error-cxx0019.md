# Expression Evaluator Error CXX0019
bad type cast  
  
 The C expression evaluator cannot perform the type cast as written.  
  
 This error is identical to CAN0019.  
  
### To fix by checking the following possible causes  
  
1.  The specified type is unknown.  
  
2.  There were too many levels of pointer types. For example, the type cast  
  
    ```  
    (char **)h_message  
    ```  
  
     cannot be evaluated by the C expression evaluator.
