A value was specified with the [/MIDL (Specify MIDL Command Line Options)](../../build/reference/midl-specify-midl-command-line-options.md) linker option that could not be resolved by the system code page.

The code page used when you specify the MIDL command (the input code page) must be the same as the system code page.
