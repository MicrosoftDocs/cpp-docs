# Linker Tools Error LNK1188
BADFIXUPSECTION:: invalid fixup target 'symbol'; possible zero length section  
  
 During a VxD link, the target of a relocation did not have a section. With LINK386 (an older version), an OMF GROUP record (generated by a MASM GROUP directive) may have been used to combine the zero length section with another non-zero length section. COFF format does not support the GROUP directive and zero-length sections. When LINK automatically converts this type of OMF objects to COFF, this error may occur.
