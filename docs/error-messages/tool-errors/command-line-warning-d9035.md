# Command-Line Warning D9035
option 'option' has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release  
  
 You specified a compiler option that will be removed in a future release of the Visual C++ compiler. This warning is followed by warning [D9036](../../error-messages/tool-errors/command-line-warning-d9036.md) if there is a suggested replacement for *option*.  
  
 The specified option still works, but you should update your build configuration now. As a result, your project is more likely to continue to build when you upgrade the compiler.
