# Command-Line Warning D9035

> option '*option*' has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release

## Remarks

You specified a compiler option that will be removed in a future release of the compiler. If there is a suggested replacement for *option*, this warning is followed by warning [D9036](../../error-messages/tool-errors/command-line-warning-d9036.md).

The specified option still works, but you should update your build configuration now. As a result, your project is more likely to continue to build when you upgrade the compiler.
