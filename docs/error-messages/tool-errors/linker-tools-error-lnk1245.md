# Linker Tools Error LNK1245

> invalid subsystem 'subsystem' specified; /SUBSYSTEM must be WINDOWS, WINDOWSCE, or CONSOLE

## Remarks

[/clr](../../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md) was used to compile the object and one of the following conditions was true:

- A custom entry point was defined ([/ENTRY](../../build/reference/entry-entry-point-symbol.md)), such that, the linker could not infer a subsystem.

- A value was passed to the [/SUBSYSTEM](../../build/reference/subsystem-specify-subsystem.md) linker option that is not valid for /clr objects.

For both situations, the resolution is to specify a valid value to the /SUBSYSTEM linker option.
