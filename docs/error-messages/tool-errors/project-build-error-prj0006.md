# Project Build Error PRJ0006
Could not open the temporary file 'file'. Make sure the file exists and that the directory is not write-protected.  
  
 Visual C++ could not create a temporary file during the build process. Reasons for this include:  
  
-   No temp directory.  
  
-   Read-only temp directory.  
  
-   Out of disk space.  
  
-   The $(IntDir) folder is either read-only or contains temporary files that are read-only.  
  
 This error will also occur following error PRJ0007: Could not create output directory 'directory'. Error PRJ0007 means that the $(IntDir) directory could not be created, implying the creation of temporarily files will also fail.  
  
 Temp files are created whenever you specify:  
  
-   A response file.  
  
-   A custom build step.  
  
-   A build event.
