# Project Build Error PRJ0006

> Could not open the temporary file 'file'. Make sure the file exists and that the directory is not write-protected.

## Remarks

Visual C++ could not create a temporary file during the build process. Reasons for this include:

- No temp directory.

- Read-only temp directory.

- Out of disk space.

- The $(IntDir) folder is either read-only or contains temporary files that are read-only.

This error will also occur following error PRJ0007: Could not create output directory 'directory'. Error PRJ0007 means that the $(IntDir) directory could not be created, implying the creation of temporarily files will also fail.

Temp files are created whenever you specify:

- A response file.

- A custom build step.

- A build event.
