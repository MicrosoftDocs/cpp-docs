# Project Build Error PRJ0044

The 'Additional Dependencies' property for custom build rule 'rule' assigned to file 'file' is invalid. The property contained 'string' which evaluates to 'value'.

The **Additional Dependencies** property evaluated to an empty string, or to a string that contained invalid characters (any character that could not be in a file or directory name). Custom build rules need the output of the build action.

For more information, see [Specifying Custom Build Tools](../../build/specifying-custom-build-tools.md).
