# NMAKE Fatal Error U1059

> syntax error : '}' missing in dependent

A search path for a dependent was incorrectly specified. Either a space existed in the path or the closing brace (**}**) was omitted.

The syntax for a directory specification for a dependent is

> **{** *directories* **}dependent**

where *directories* specifies one or more paths, each separated by a semicolon (**;**). No spaces are allowed.

If part or all of a search path is replaced by a macro, make sure no spaces exist in the macro expansion.
