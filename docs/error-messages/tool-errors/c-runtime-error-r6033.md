# C Runtime Error R6033
Attempt to use MSIL code from this assembly during native code initialization. This indicates a bug in your application. It is most likely the result of calling an MSIL-compiled (/clr) function from a native constructor or from DllMain.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you encounter this error message while running an app, the app was shut down because it has an internal problem. This error can be caused by a bug in the app, or by a bug in an add-in or extension that it uses.  
>   
>  You can try these steps to fix this error:  
>   
>  -   Use the **Apps and Features** or **Programs and Features** page in the **Control Panel** to repair or reinstall the program.  
> -   Use the **Apps and Features** or **Programs and Features** page in the **Control Panel** to remove, repair or reinstall any extensions or add-ins.  
> -   Check **Windows Update** in the **Control Panel** for software updates.  
> -   Check for an updated version of the app. Contact the app vendor if the problem persists.  
  
 **Information for Programmers**  
  
 This diagnostic indicates that MSIL instructions were executing during loader lock. This can occur if you have compiled native C++ by using the /clr flag. Only use the /clr flag on modules that contain managed code. For more information, see [Initialization of Mixed Assemblies](../../dotnet/initialization-of-mixed-assemblies.md).
