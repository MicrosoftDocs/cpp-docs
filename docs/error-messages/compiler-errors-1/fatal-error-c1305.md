# Fatal Error C1305
profile database 'pgd_file' is for a different architecture  
  
 A .pgd file that was generated from the /LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT operation for another platform was passed to [/LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE](../../build/reference/ltcg-link-time-code-generation.md) . [Profile-guided optimizations](../../build/reference/profile-guided-optimizations.md) are available for x86 and x64 platforms. However, a .pgd file generated with a /LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT operation for one platform is not valid as input to a /LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE for a different platform.  
  
 To resolve this error, only pass a .pgd file that is created with /LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT to /LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE on the same platform.
