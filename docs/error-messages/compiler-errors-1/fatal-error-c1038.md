# Fatal Error C1038

> compiler limit : function : control flow state too complex; simplify function

## Remarks

The function has more control-flow states than the compiler can handle. Simplify control flow or split the function into smaller functions.

This error is obsolete in Visual Studio 2022 and later versions.
