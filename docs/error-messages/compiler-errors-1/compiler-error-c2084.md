# Compiler Error C2084

> function '*function*' already has a body

## Remarks

The function has already been defined.

Before Visual Studio 2002,

- The compiler would accept multiple template specializations that resolved to the same actual type, although the additional definitions would never be available. The compiler now detects these multiple definitions.

- **`__int32`** and **`int`** were treated as separate types. The compiler now treats **`__int32`** as a synonym for **`int`**. This means that the compiler detects multiple definitions if a function is overloaded on both **`__int32`** and **`int`** and gives an error.

## Example

The following example generates C2084:

```cpp
// C2084.cpp
void Func(int);
void Func(int) {}   // define function
void Func(int) {}   // C2084 second definition
```

To correct this error, remove the duplicate definition:

```cpp
// C2084b.cpp
// compile with: /c
void Func(int);
void Func(int) {}
```
