# Compiler Error C2459
'identifier' : is being defined; cannot add as an anonymous member  
  
 A class, structure, or union is redefined in its own scope by a member of an anonymous union.  
  
 The following sample generates C2459:  
  
```  
// C2459.cpp  
// compile with: /c  
class C {  
   union { int C; };   // C2459  
   union { int D; };  
};  
```
