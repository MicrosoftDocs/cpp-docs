# Fatal Error C1099
Edit and Continue engine terminating compile  
  
 Edit and Continue loaded a precompiled header file in preparation for compiling code changes, but subsequent actions (such as code changes prior to the precompiled header `#include` statement or stopping the debugger) prevented Edit and Continue from finishing the compile with that process. You do not need to take any action to fix this error.
