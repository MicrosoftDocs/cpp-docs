# Compiler Error C2057
expected constant expression  
  
 The context requires a constant expression, an expression whose value is known at compile time.  
  
 The compiler must know the size of a type at compile time in order to allocate space for an instance of that type.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C2057 and shows how to fix it:  
  
```  
// C2057.cpp  
int i;  
int b[i];   // C2057 - value of i is unknown at compile time  
int main() {  
   const int i = 8;  
   int b[i]; // OK - value of i is fixed and known to compiler  
}  
```  
  
## Example  
 C has more restrictive rules for constant expressions.  The following sample generates C2057 and shows how to fix it:  
  
```  
// C2057b.c  
#define ArraySize1 10  
int main() {   
   const int ArraySize2 = 10;   
   int h[ArraySize2];   // C2057 - C does not allow variables here  
   int h[ArraySize1];   // OK - uses preprocessor constant  
}  
```
