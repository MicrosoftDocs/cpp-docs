# Compiler Error C2384

> 'member' : cannot apply __declspec(thread) to a member of a managed or WinRT class

## Remarks

The [thread](../../cpp/thread.md) **`__declspec`** modifier cannot be used on a member of a managed or Windows Runtime class.

Static thread local storage in managed code can only be used for statically loaded DLLsâ€”the DLL must be statically loaded when the process starts. Windows Runtime does not support thread local storage.

## Example

The following line generates C2384 and shows how to fix it in C++/CLI code:

```cpp
// C2384.cpp
// compile with: /clr /c
public ref class B {
public:
   __declspec( thread ) static int tls_i = 1;   // C2384

   // OK - declare with attribute instead
   [System::ThreadStaticAttribute]
   static int tls_j;
};
```
