# Compiler Error C2384
'member' : cannot apply __declspec(thread) to a member of a managed or WinRT class  
  
 The [thread](../../cpp/thread.md) `__declspec` modifier cannot be used on a member of a managed or Windows Runtime class.  
  
 Static thread local storage in managed code can only be used for statically loaded DLLsâ€”the DLL must be statically loaded when the process starts. Windows Runtime does not support thread local storage.  
  
 The following line generates C2384 and shows how to fix it in C++/CLI code:  
  
```  
// C2384.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /c  
public ref class B {  
public:  
   __declspec( thread ) static int tls_i = 1;   // C2384  
  
   // OK - declare with attribute instead  
   [System::ThreadStaticAttribute]  
   static int tls_j;  
};  
```
