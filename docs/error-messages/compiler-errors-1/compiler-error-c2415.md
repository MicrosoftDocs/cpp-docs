# Compiler Error C2415
improper operand type  
  
 The opcode does not use operands of this type.  
  
### To fix by checking the following possible causes  
  
1.  The opcode does not support the number of operands used. Check an assembly-language reference manual to determine the correct number of operands.  
  
2.  A newer processor supports the instruction with additional types. Adjust the [/arch (Minimum CPU Architecture)](../../build/reference/arch-minimum-cpu-architecture.md) option to use the later processor.
