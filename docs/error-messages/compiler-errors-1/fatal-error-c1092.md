# Fatal Error C1092

> Edit and Continue does not support changes to data types; build required

## Remarks

You changed or added a data type since the last successful build.

- Edit and Continue does not support changes to existing data types, including class, struct, or enum definitions. You must stop debugging and build the application.

- Edit and Continue does not support the addition of new data types if a program database file, such as vc*x*0.pdb (where *x* is the major version of Visual C++ in use) is read-only. To add data types, the compiler must open the .pdb file in write mode.

### To remove this error without ending the current debug session

1. Change the data type back to its state prior to the error.

1. From the **Debug** menu, choose **Apply Code Changes**.

### To remove this error without changing your source code

1. From the **Debug** menu, choose **Stop Debugging**.

1. From the **Build** menu, choose **Build**.

For further information, see the [Supported Code Changes](/visualstudio/debugger/supported-code-changes-cpp).
