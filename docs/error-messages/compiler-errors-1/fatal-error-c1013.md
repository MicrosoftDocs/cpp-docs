# Fatal Error C1013

> compiler limit : too many open parentheses

## Remarks

An expression contains too many levels of parentheses in a single expression. Simplify the expression or break it into multiple statements.

Prior to Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 3, the limit on nested parenthesis in a single expression was 59. Currently, the limit on nested parenthesis is 256.
