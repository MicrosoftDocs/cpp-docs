# Fatal Error C1853

> '*filename*' precompiled header file is from a previous version of the compiler, or the precompiled header is C++ and you are using it from C (or vice versa)

## Remarks

Possible causes:

- The precompiled header was compiled with a previous compiler version. Try recompiling the header with the current compiler.

- The precompiled header is C++ and you are using it from C. Try recompiling the header for use with C by specifying one of the [/Tc](../../build/reference/tc-tp-tc-tp-specify-source-file-type.md) compiler options, or changing the suffix of the source file to "c". For more information, see [Two Choices for Precompiling Code](../../build/creating-precompiled-header-files.md#two-choices-for-precompiling-code).
