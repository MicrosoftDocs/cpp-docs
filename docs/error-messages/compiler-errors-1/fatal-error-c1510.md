# Fatal Error C1510
Cannot open language resource clui.dll  
  
 The compiler can't load the language resource DLL.  
  
There are two common causes for this issue. When using the 32-bit compiler and tools, you may see this error for large projects that use more than 2GB of memory during a link. A possible solution on 64-bit Windows systems is to use the 64-bit native or cross compiler and tools to generate your code. This takes advantage of the larger memory space available to 64-bit apps. If you must use a 32-bit compiler because you are running on a 32-bit system, in some cases you can increase the amount of memory available to the linker to 3GB. For more information, see [4-Gigabyte Tuning: BCDEdit and Boot.ini](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vs/alm/bb613473\(v=vs.85\).aspx) and the [BCDEdit /set increaseuserva](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff542202.aspx) command.  

The other common cause is a broken or incomplete Visual Studio installation. In this case, run the installer again to repair or reinstall Visual Studio.
