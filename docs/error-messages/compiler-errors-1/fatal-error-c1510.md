# Fatal Error C1510

> Cannot open language resource clui.dll

## Remarks

The compiler can't load the language resource DLL.

There are two common causes for this issue. When using the 32-bit compiler and tools, you may see this error for large projects that use more than 2GB of memory during a link. A possible solution on 64-bit Windows systems is to use the 64-bit native or cross compiler and tools to generate your code. This takes advantage of the larger memory space available to 64-bit apps. If you must use a 32-bit compiler because you are running on a 32-bit system, in some cases you can increase the amount of memory available to the linker to 3GB. For more information, see [4-Gigabyte Tuning: BCDEdit and Boot.ini](/windows/win32/memory/4-gigabyte-tuning) and the [BCDEdit /set increaseuserva](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/bcdedit--set) command.

The other common cause is a broken or incomplete Visual Studio installation. In this case, run the installer again to repair or reinstall Visual Studio.
