# Fatal Error C1084

Cannot read filetype file: 'file': message

This error is generally the result of a failed internal system API call made by the compiler. The message shown when this error is encountered is often generated by either [_wcserror_s](../../c-runtime-library/reference/strerror-s-strerror-s-wcserror-s-wcserror-s.md) or [FormatMessage](/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-formatmessage).

Performing the following steps may help resolve C1084:

- Ensure the specified file exists.

- Ensure the appropriate permissions are set in order to access the specified file.

- Ensure the command-line syntax adheres to the rules outlined under [Compiler Command-Line Syntax](../../build/reference/compiler-command-line-syntax.md).

- Ensure sure the environment variables **TMP** and **TEMP** are properly set, as well as the appropriate permissions in order to access the directories these environment variables refer to. Also ensure that the drives referenced by the **TMP** and **TEMP** environment variables contain an adequate amount of free space.

- If the message says "bad file number", the specified file may have been closing in the foreground while compiling in the background.

After performing the above diagnostics, perform a clean build.
