# Fatal Error C1046

compiler limit : structure nested too deeply

The structure, union, or class exceeded the nesting limit, which is 15 levels. Rewrite the definition to reduce the nesting level. Split the structure, union, or class into two or more parts by using **`typedef`** to define one or more of the nested structures.
