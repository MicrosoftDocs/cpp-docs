# Compiler Error C2482

>'*identifier*' : dynamic initialization of 'thread' data not allowed in managed/WinRT code

## Remarks

In managed or WinRT code, variables declared by using the [__declspec(thread)](../../cpp/thread.md) storage class modifier attribute or the [thread_local](../../cpp/storage-classes-cpp.md#thread_local) storage class specifier cannot be initialized with an expression that requires evaluation at run-time. A static expression is required to initialize `__declspec(thread)` or `thread_local` data in these runtime environments.

## Example

The following sample generates C2482 in managed (**/clr**) and in WinRT (**/ZW**) code:

```cpp
// C2482.cpp
// For managed example, compile with: cl /EHsc /c /clr C2482.cpp
// For WinRT example, compile with: cl /EHsc /c /ZW C2482.cpp
#define Thread __declspec( thread )
Thread int tls_i1 = tls_i1;   // C2482

int j = j;   // OK in C++; C error
Thread int tls_i2 = sizeof( tls_i2 );   // Okay in C and C++
```

To fix this issue, initialize thread-local storage by using a constant, **constexpr**, or static expression. Perform any thread-specific initialization separately.
