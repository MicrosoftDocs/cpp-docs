# Fatal Error C1077

> compiler limit : cannot have more than number command line options

## Remarks

The number of command-line options exceeds the internal limit.

There may be too many symbols defined with [/D](../../build/reference/d-preprocessor-definitions.md). (Place the definitions in a header file instead.)
