# Fatal Error C1098

> Version mismatch with Edit and Continue engine

## Remarks

The debugger version you are using does not match the compiler used to create the executable. If recompiling does not fix the problem, you may need to reinstall Visual C++ to make sure you have the proper versions of the debugger and compiler.
