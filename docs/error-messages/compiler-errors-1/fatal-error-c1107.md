# Fatal Error C1107
could not find assembly 'file': please specify the assembly search path using /AI or by setting the LIBPATH environment variable  
  
 A metadata file was passed to a [#using](../../preprocessor/hash-using-directive-cpp.md) directive that the compiler was unable to locate.  
  
 LIBPATH, which is described in the topic for `#using`, and the [/AI](../../build/reference/ai-specify-metadata-directories.md) compiler option allow you to specify directories in which the compiler will look for referenced metadata files.
