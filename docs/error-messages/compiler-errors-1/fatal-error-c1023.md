# Fatal Error C1023
'file' : unexpected error with pch, try rebuilding the pch  
  
 C1023 could be caused by one of several problems, the solution to which is a rebuild of the precompiled header file.  
  
 C1023 may be caused if you attempt to use a precompiled header file on a machine other than the one on which it was built.
