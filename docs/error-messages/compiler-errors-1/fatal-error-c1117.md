# Fatal Error C1117

> unrecoverable error importing module/headerunit '*name*': symbol '*symbol-name*' has already been defined

## Remarks

The compiler found a redefinition of an existing type. To resolve the issue, verify that the symbol has only one definition across modules and translation units.
