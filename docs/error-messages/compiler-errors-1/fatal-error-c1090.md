# Fatal Error C1090

> PDB API call failed, error code '*error-number*': *message*

## Remarks

An error occurred in processing a PDB file.

Error C1090 is a catch-all for uncommon compiler PDB file errors that aren't reported separately. We only have generic advice for resolving this issue:

- Do a clean operation in your build directories, and then do a full build of your solution.

- Reboot your computer, or check for stray or unresponsive mspdbsrv.exe processes and kill them in TaskManager.

- Turn off antivirus checks in your project directories.

- Use the [`/Zf`](../../build/reference/zf.md) compiler option if using [`/MP`](../../build/reference/mp-build-with-multiple-processes.md) with MSBuild or another parallel build process.

- Try building by using the 64-bit hosted toolset.
