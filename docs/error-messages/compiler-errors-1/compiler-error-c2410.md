# Compiler Error C2410
'identifier' : ambiguous member name in 'context'  
  
 The identifier is a member of more than one structure or union in this context.  
  
 Use a structure or union specifier on the operand that caused the error. A structure or union specifier is an identifier of type `struct` or `union` (a `typedef` name or a variable of the same type as the structure or union being referenced). The specifier must be the left operand of the first member-selection operator (.) to use the operand.
