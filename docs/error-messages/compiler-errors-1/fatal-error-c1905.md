# Fatal Error C1905
Front end and back end not compatible (must target same processor)  
  
 This error occurs when a .obj file is generated by a compiler front end (C1.dll) that targets one processor, such as x86, ARM, or [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../../assembler/inline/includes/vcprx64_md.md)], but is being read by a back end (C2.dll) that targets a different processor.  
  
 To fix this issue, ensure that you are using a matching front end and back end. This is the default for projects created in Visual Studio. This error may occur if you have edited the project file and used different paths to the compiler tools. If you have not specifically set the path for the compiler tools, then this error may occur if your Visual Studio installation is corrupt. For example, you may have copied the compiler .dll files from one location to another. Use **Programs and Features** in the Windows Control Panel to repair or reinstall Visual Studio.
