# Compiler Error C2220

> warning treated as error - no object file generated

## Remarks

[/WX](../../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md) tells the compiler to treat all warnings as errors. Because an error occurred, no object or executable file was generated.

This error only appears when the **/WX** flag is set and a warning occurs during compilation. To fix this error, you must eliminate every warning in your project.

### To fix, use one of the following techniques

- Fix the problems that cause warnings in your project.

- Compile at a lower warning levelâ€”for example, use **/W3** instead of **/W4**.

- Use a [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma to disable or suppress a specific warning.

- Don't use **/WX** to compile.
