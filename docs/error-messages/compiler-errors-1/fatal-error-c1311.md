# Fatal Error C1311
COFF format cannot statically initialize 'var' with number byte(s) of an address  
  
 An address whose value is not known at compile time cannot be statically assigned to a variable whose type has storage of less than four bytes.  
  
 This error can occur on code that is otherwise valid C++.  
  
 The following example shows one condition that might cause C1311.  
  
```  
char c = (char)"Hello, world";   // C1311  
char *d = (char*)"Hello, world";   // OK  
```
