# Fatal Error C1205

> Generics are not supported by the version of the runtime installed

## Remarks

The version of the common language runtime that the compiler is using isn't a version of the runtime supported by the current compiler.  For example, the generics feature requires a runtime that is matched to the compiler.

Your path specification may need to be modified.

This error is obsolete in Visual Studio 2022 and later versions.
