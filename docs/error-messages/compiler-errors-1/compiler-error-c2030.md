# Compiler Error C2030
a destructor with 'protected private' accessibility cannot be a member of a class declared 'sealed'  
  
 A Windows Runtime class declared as `sealed` cannot have a protected private destructor. Only public virtual and private non-virtual destructors are allowed on sealed types. For more information, see [Ref classes and structs](../../cppcx/ref-classes-and-structs-c-cx.md).  
  
 To fix this error, change the accessibility of the destructor.
