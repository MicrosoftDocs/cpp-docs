# Compiler Error C2360

> initialization of 'identifier' is skipped by 'case' label

## Remarks

The initialization of `identifier` can be skipped in a **`switch`** statement. You cannot jump past a declaration with an initializer unless the declaration is enclosed in a block. (Unless it is declared within a block, the variable is within scope until the end of the **`switch`** statement.)

## Example

The following example generates C2360:

```cpp
// C2360.cpp
int main() {
   int x = 0;
   switch ( x ) {
   case 0 :
      int i = 1;
      { int j = 1; }
   case 1 :   // C2360
      int k = 1;
   }
}
```

Possible resolution:

```cpp
// C2360b.cpp
int main() {
   int x = 0;
   switch ( x ) {
   case 0 :
      { int j = 1; int i = 1;}
   case 1 :
      int k = 1;
   }
}
```
