# Compiler Error C2414
illegal number of operands  
  
### To fix by checking the following possible causes  
  
1.  The opcode does not support the number of operands used. Check an assembly-language reference manual to determine the correct number of operands.  
  
2.  A newer processor supports the instruction with a different number of operands. Adjust the [/arch (Minimum CPU Architecture)](../../build/reference/arch-minimum-cpu-architecture.md) option to use the later processor.
