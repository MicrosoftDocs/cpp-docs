# Fatal Error C1201

> unable to continue after syntax error in class template definition

## Remarks

An unexpected error occurred while parsing a class template definition.

Fix any other errors and recompile. If that fails, note the circumstances of the error, try to isolate the problem and create a reproducible test case, then contact [Microsoft Product Support Services](/visualstudio/ide/talk-to-us).
