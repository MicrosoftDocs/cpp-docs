# Fatal Error C1208

> Allocating reference classes on the stack is not supported by the version of the runtime installed

## Remarks

C1208 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.

Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.

Install the common language runtime version that is intended for use with your compiler.

This error is obsolete in Visual Studio 2022 and later versions.
