# Fatal Error C1208

Allocating reference classes on the stack is not supported by the version of the runtime installed

C1208 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.

Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.

Install the common language runtime version that is intended for use with your compiler.
