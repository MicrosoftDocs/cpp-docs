# Compiler Error C2247
'identifier' not accessible because 'class' uses 'specifier' to inherit from 'class'  
  
 `identifier` is inherited from a class declared with private or protected access.  
  
 The following sample generates C2247:  
  
```  
// C2247.cpp  
class A {  
public:  
   int i;  
};  
class B : private A {};    // B inherits a private A  
class C : public B {} c;   // so even though C's B is public  
int j = c.i;               // C2247, i not accessible  
```  
  
 This error can also be generated as a result of compiler conformance work that was done for Visual Studio .NET 2003: access control with protected members. A protected member (n) can only be accessed through a member function of a class (B) that inherits from the class (A) of which it (n) is a member.  
  
 For code that is valid in both the Visual Studio .NET 2003 and Visual Studio .NET versions of Visual C++, declare the member to be a friend of the type. Public inheritance could also be used.  
  
```  
// C2247b.cpp  
// compile with: /c  
// C2247 expected  
class A {  
public:  
   void f();  
   int n;  
};  
  
class B: protected A {  
   // Uncomment the following line to resolve.  
   // friend void A::f();  
};  
  
void A::f() {  
   B b;  
   b.n;  
}  
```  
  
 C2247 can also be generated as a result of compiler conformance work that was done for Visual Studio .NET 2003: private base classes now inaccessible. A class (A) that is a private base class to a type (B) should not be accessible to a type (C) that uses B as a base class.  
  
 For code that is valid in both the Visual Studio .NET 2003 and Visual Studio .NET versions of Visual C++, use the scope operator.  
  
```  
// C2247c.cpp  
// compile with: /c  
struct A {};  
  
struct B: private A {};  
  
struct C : B {  
   void f() {  
      A *p1 = (A*) this;   // C2247  
      // try the following line instead  
      // ::A *p2 = (::A*) this;  
   }  
};  
```
