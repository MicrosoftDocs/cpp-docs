# Compiler Error C2338

> *Error message*

This error can be caused by a **`static_assert`** error during compilation. The message is supplied by the **`static_assert`** parameters.

This error message can also be generated by external providers to the compiler. In most cases, these errors are reported by an attribute provider DLL, such as ATLPROV. Some common forms of this message include:

- '*attribute*' Atl Attribute Provider : error ATL*number* *message*

- Incorrect usage of attribute '*attribute*'

- '*usage*': incorrect format for attribute 'usage'

These errors are often unrecoverable, and may be followed by a fatal compiler error.

To fix these issues, correct the attribute usage. For example, in some cases, attribute parameters must be declared before they can be used. If an ATL error number is provided, check the documentation for that error for more specific information.
