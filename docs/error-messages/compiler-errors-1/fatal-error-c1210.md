# Fatal Error C1210

> /clr:pure and /clr:safe are not supported by the version of the runtime installed

The **/clr:pure** and **/clr:safe** compiler options are deprecated in Visual Studio 2015 and unsupported in Visual Studio 2017.

C1210 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.

Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.

To resolve C1210 install the common language runtime version that is intended for use with your compiler.
