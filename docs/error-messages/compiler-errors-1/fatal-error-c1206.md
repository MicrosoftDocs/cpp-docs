# Fatal Error C1206

> Per-appdomain data is not supported by the version of the runtime installed

## Remarks

Some features, such as per application domain data, are only supported by the common language runtime that supports the feature.

C1206 indicates that the latest version of the runtime isn't installed on your computer. Install the common language runtime version that is intended for use with your compiler.

For more information, see [`appdomain`](../../cpp/appdomain.md)

This error is obsolete in Visual Studio 2022 and later versions.
