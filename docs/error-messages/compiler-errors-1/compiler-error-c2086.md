# Compiler Error C2086

> 'identifier' : redefinition

## Remarks

The identifier is defined more than once, or a subsequent declaration differs from a previous one.

C2086 can also be the result of incremental building for a referenced C# assembly. Rebuild the C# assembly to resolve this error.

## Example

The following example generates C2086:

```cpp
// C2086.cpp
int main() {
  int a;
  int a;   // C2086 not an error in ANSI C
}
```
