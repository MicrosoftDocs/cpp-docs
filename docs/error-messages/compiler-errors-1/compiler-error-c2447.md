# Compiler Error C2447

> '{' : missing function header (old-style formal list?)

## Remarks

The compiler encountered an unexpected open brace at global scope. In most cases, this is caused by a badly-formed function header, a misplaced declaration, or a stray semi-colon. To resolve this issue, verify that the open brace follows a correctly-formed function header, and is not preceded by a declaration or a stray semi-colon.

This error can also be caused by an old-style C-language formal argument list. To resolve this issue, refactor the argument list to use modern styleâ€”that is, enclosed in parentheses.

## Example

The following example generates C2447:

```cpp
// C2447.cpp
int c;
{}       // C2447
```
