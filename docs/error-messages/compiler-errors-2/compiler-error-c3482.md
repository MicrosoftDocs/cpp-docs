# Compiler Error C3482

'this' can only be used as a lambda capture within a non-static member function

You cannot pass `this` to the capture list of a lambda expression that is declared in a static method or a global function.

### To correct this error

- Convert the enclosing function to a non-static method, or

- Remove the `this` pointer from the capture list of the lambda expression.

## Example

The following example generates C3482:

```
// C3482.cpp
// compile with: /c

class C
{
public:
   static void staticMethod()
   {
      [this] {}(); // C3482
   }
};
```
