# Compiler Error C3510
cannot locate dependent type library 'type_lib'  
  
 [no_registry](../../preprocessor/no-registry.md) and [auto_search](../../preprocessor/auto-search.md) were passed to `#import` but the compiler was not able to find a referenced type library.  
  
 To resolve this error, make sure that all type libraries and referenced type libraries are available to the compiler.  
  
 The following sample generates C3510:  
  
 Assume that the following two type libraries were built, and that C3510a.tlb was deleted or not on the path.  
  
```  
// C3510a.idl  
[uuid("f87070ba-c6d9-405c-a8e4-8cd9ca25c12b")]  
library C3510aLib  
{  
   [uuid("f87070ba-c6d9-405c-a8e4-8cd9ca25c12c")]  
   enum E_C3510  
   {  
      one, two, three  
   };  
};  
```  
  
 And then the source code for the second type library:  
  
```  
// C3510b.idl  
// post-build command: del /f C3510a.tlb  
[uuid("f87070ba-c6d9-405c-a8e4-8cd9ca25c12e")]  
library C3510bLib  
{  
   importlib ("C3510a.tlb");  
   [uuid("f87070ba-c6d9-405c-a8e4-8cd9ca25c12d")]  
   struct S_C3510 {  
      enum E_C3510 e;  
   };  
};  
```  
  
 And then the client code:  
  
```  
// C3510.cpp  
#import "c3510b.tlb" no_registry auto_search   // C3510  
int main() {  
   C3510aLib::S_C4336 ccc;  
}  
```
