# Compiler Error C2632
'type1' followed by 'type2' is illegal  
  
 This error can be caused if there is missing code between two type specifiers.  
  
 The following sample generates C2632:  
  
```  
// C2632.cpp  
int float i;   // C2632  
```  
  
 This error can also be generated as a result of compiler conformance work that was done for Visual Studio .NET 2003. `bool` is now a proper type. In previous versions, `bool` was a typedef, and you could create identifiers with that name.  
  
 The following sample generates C2632:  
  
```  
// C2632_2.cpp  
// compile with: /LD  
void f(int bool);   // C2632  
```  
  
 To resolve this error so that the code is valid in both the Visual Studio .NET 2003 and Visual Studio .NET versions of Visual C++, rename the identifier.
