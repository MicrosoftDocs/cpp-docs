# Compiler Error C3490
'var' cannot be modified because it is being accessed through a const object  
  
 A lambda expression that is declared in a `const` method cannot modify non-mutable member data.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `const` modifier from your method declaration.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates C3490 because it modifies the member variable `_i` in a `const` method:  
  
```  
// C3490a.cpp  
// compile with: /c  
  
class C  
{  
   void f() const   
   {  
      auto x = [=]() { _i = 20; }; // C3490  
   }  
  
   int _i;  
};  
```  
  
## Example  
 The following example resolves C3490 by removing the `const` modifier from the method declaration:  
  
```  
// C3490b.cpp  
// compile with: /c  
  
class C  
{  
   void f()  
   {  
      auto x = [=]() { _i = 20; };  
   }  
  
   int _i;  
};  
```
