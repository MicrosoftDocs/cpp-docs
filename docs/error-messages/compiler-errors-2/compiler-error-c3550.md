# Compiler Error C3550

only plain 'decltype(auto)' is allowed in this context

If `decltype(auto)` is used as a placeholder for the return type of a function, it must be used by itself. It cannot be used as part of a pointer declaration (`decltype(auto*)`), a reference declaration (`decltype(auto&)`), or any other such qualification.
