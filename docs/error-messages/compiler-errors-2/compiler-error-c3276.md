# Compiler Error C3276
'keyword' : jump out of __finally/finally block has undefined behavior during termination handling  
  
 This error is the same as the [C4532](../../error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-1-c4532.md) warning. However, when you are using /clr, this condition cannot be disabled with the [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma.
