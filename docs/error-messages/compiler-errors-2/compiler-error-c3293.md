# Compiler Error C3293
'accessor': use 'default' to access the default property (indexer) for class 'type'  
  
 An indexed property was accessed incorrectly.  See [How to: Use Properties in C++/CLI](../../dotnet/how-to-use-properties-in-cpp-cli.md) for more information.  

 **Visual Studio 2017 and later**: In Visual Studio 2015 and earlier, the compiler in some cases misidentified a default property as a default indexer. It was possible to work around the issue by using the identifier "default" to access the property. The workaround itself became problematic after default was introduced as a keyword in C++11. Therefore, in Visual Studio 2017 the bugs that required the workaround were fixed, and the compiler now raises an error when "default" is used to access the default property for a class.
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C3293 in Visual Studio 2015 and earlier.  
  
```  
// C3293.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /c  
using namespace System;  
ref class IndexerClass {  
public:  
   // default indexer  
   property int default[int] {  
      int get(int index) { return 0; }  
      void set(int index, int value) {}  
   }  
};  
  
int main() {  
   IndexerClass ^ ic = gcnew IndexerClass;  
   ic->Item[0] = 21;   // C3293 in VS2015 OK in VS2017
   ic->default[0] = 21;   // OK in VS2015 and earlier
  
   String ^s = "Hello";  
   wchar_t wc = s->Chars[0];   // C3293 in VS2015 OK in VS2017
   wchar_t wc2 = s->default[0];   // OK in VS2015 and earlier  
   Console::WriteLine(wc2);  
}  
```
