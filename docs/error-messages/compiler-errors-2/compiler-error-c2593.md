# Compiler Error C2593

> 'operator identifier' is ambiguous

## Remarks

More than one possible operator is defined for an overloaded operator.

This error may be fixed if you use an explicit cast on one or more actual parameters.

## Examples

The following example generates C2593:

```cpp
// C2593.cpp
struct A {};
struct B : A {};
struct X {};
struct D : B, X {};
void operator+( X, X );
void operator+( A, B );
D d;

int main() {
   d +  d;         // C2593, D has an A, B, and X
   (X)d + (X)d;    // OK, uses operator+( X, X )
}
```

This error can be caused by serializing a floating-point variable using a `CArchive` object. The compiler identifies the `<<` operator as ambiguous. The only primitive C++ types that `CArchive` can serialize are the fixed-size types `BYTE`, `WORD`, `DWORD`, and `LONG`. All integer types must be cast to one of these types for serialization. Floating-point types must be archived using the `CArchive::Write()` member function.

The following example shows how to archive a floating-point variable (`f`) to archive `ar`:

```
ar.Write(&f, sizeof( float ));
```
