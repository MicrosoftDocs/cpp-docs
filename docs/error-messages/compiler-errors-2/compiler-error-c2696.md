# Compiler Error C2696
Cannot create a temporary object of a managed type 'type'  
  
References to `const` in an unmanaged program cause the compiler to call the constructor and create a temporary object on the stack. However, a managed class can never be created on the stack.  
  
C2696 is only reachable using the obsolete compiler option **/clr:oldSyntax**.
