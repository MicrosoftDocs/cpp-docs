# Compiler Error C3465

> to use type 'type' you must reference the assembly 'assembly'

## Remarks

Type forwarding will work for a client application until you recompile the client. When you recompile, you will need a reference for every assembly containing the definition of a type used in your client application.

For more information, see [Type Forwarding (C++/CLI)](../../extensions/type-forwarding-cpp-cli.md).

## Example

The following example builds an assembly that contains the new location of a type.

```cpp
// C3465.cpp
// compile with: /clr /LD
public ref class R {
public:
   ref class N {};
};
```

The following example builds an assembly that used to contain the definition of the type, but now contains forwarding syntax for the type.

```cpp
// C3465_b.cpp
// compile with: /clr /LD
#using "C3465.dll"
[ assembly:TypeForwardedTo(R::typeid) ];
```

The following example generates C3465.

```cpp
// C3465_c.cpp
// compile with: /clr
// C3465 expected
#using "C3465_b.dll"
// Uncomment the following line to resolve.
// #using "C3465.dll"

int main() {
   R^ r = gcnew R();
}
```
