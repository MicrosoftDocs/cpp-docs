# Compiler Error C3160
'pointer' : a data member of a managed or WinRT class cannot have this type  
  
 Interior garbage collection pointers may point to the interior of a managed or WinRT class. Because they are slower than whole-object pointers and require special handling by the garbage collector, you cannot declare interior managed pointers as members of a class.  
  
 The following sample generates C3160:  
  
```  
// C3160.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
ref struct A {  
   // cannot create interior pointers inside a class  
   interior_ptr<int> pg;   // C3160  
   int g;   // OK  
   int* pg2;   // OK  
};  
  
int main() {  
   interior_ptr<int> pg2;   // OK  
}  
```
