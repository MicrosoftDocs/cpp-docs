# Compiler Error C3421

> 'type' : you cannot call the finalizer for this class as it is either inaccessible or it does not exist

## Remarks

A finalizer is implicitly private, so it cannot be called from outside its enclosing type.

For more information, see [Destructors and finalizers in How to: Define and consume classes and structs (C++/CLI)](../../dotnet/how-to-define-and-consume-classes-and-structs-cpp-cli.md#BKMK_Destructors_and_finalizers).

## Example

The following example generates C3421.

```cpp
// C3421.cpp
// compile with: /clr
ref class A {};

ref class B {
   !B() {}

public:
   ~B() {}
};

int main() {
   A a;
   a.!A();   // C3421

   B b;
   b.!B();   // C3421
}
```
