# Compiler Error C3612
'type': a sealed class cannot be abstract  
  
Types defined by using `value` are sealed by default, and a class is abstract unless it implements all methods of its base. A sealed abstract class can neither be a base class nor can it be instantiated.  
  
For more information, see [Classes and Structs](../../windows/classes-and-structs-cpp-component-extensions.md).  
  
## Example  
The following sample generates C3612:  
  
```  
// C3612.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /c  
value struct V: public System::ICloneable {};   // C3612  
  
// OK  
value struct V2: public System::ICloneable {  
   Object^ Clone();  
};  
```
