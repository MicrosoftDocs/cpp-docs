# Compiler Error C2911
'member' : cannot be declared or defined in the current scope  
  
 Inside a namespace, class, or function, you can only define a member of the same namespace, class, or function or a member that is enclosed by the same namespace, class, or function.  
  
 The following sample generates C2911:  
  
```  
// C2911.cpp  
struct A;  
  
namespace M {  
   struct D;  
}  
  
namespace N {  
   struct C;  
  
   namespace O {  
      struct B;  
   }  
  
   // in N  
   struct ::A {};   // C2911  A is member of global NS  
   struct O::B{};   // OK B is in O, O is inside of N  
   struct C {};     // OK C is member of N  
   struct M::D {};  // C2911 D is member of M, M not enclosed by N  
}  
```
