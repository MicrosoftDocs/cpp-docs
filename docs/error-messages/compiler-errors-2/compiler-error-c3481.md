# Compiler Error C3481

'var': lambda capture variable not found

The compiler could not find the definition of a variable that you passed to the capture list of a lambda expression.

### To correct this error

- Remove the variable from the capture list of the lambda expression.

## Example

The following example generates C3481 because the variable `n` is not defined:

```
// C3481.cpp

int main()
{
   [n] {}(); // C3481
}
```
