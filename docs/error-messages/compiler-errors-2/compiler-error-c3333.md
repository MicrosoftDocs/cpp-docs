# Compiler Error C3333

> 'type library': cannot #import corrupt type library

## Remarks

The type library specified in the `#import` statement is unreadable by the compiler. You may want to either regenerate the type library, if possible, or request a new type library from your supplier. You may want to use the OLE Viewer, supplied with Visual C++, to view the type library file to see what is the matter with it.
