# Compiler Error C3366

> 'variable' : static data members of managed or WinRTtypes must be defined within the class definition

## Remarks

You attempted to reference a static member of a WinRT or .NET class or interface outside the definition of that class or interface.

The compiler needs to know the full definition of the class (to emit the meta-data after one pass) and requires static data members to be initialized within the class.

## Example

For example, the following example generates C3366 and shows how to fix it:

```cpp
// C3366.cpp
// compile with: /clr /c
ref class X {
   public:
   static int i;   // initialize i here to avoid C3366
};

int X::i = 5;      // C3366
```
