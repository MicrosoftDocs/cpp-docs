# Compiler Error C3334
cannot #import corrupt type library  
  
 The library file in a `#import` statement is corrupt and can't be consumed by the compiler.  Corruption can come from bad generation of the module, disk corruption, or if the binary file was somehow edited and modified.  
  
 For more information, see [#import Directive](../../preprocessor/hash-import-directive-cpp.md).
