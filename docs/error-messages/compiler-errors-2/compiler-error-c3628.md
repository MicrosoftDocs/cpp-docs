# Compiler Error C3628
'base class' : managed or WinRTclasses only support public inheritance  
  
An attempt was made to use a managed or WinRT class as a [private](../../cpp/private-cpp.md) or [protected](../../cpp/protected-cpp.md) base class. A managed or WinRT class can only be used as a base class with [public](../../cpp/public-cpp.md) access.  
  
The following sample generates C3628 and shows how to fix it:  
  
```  
// C3628a.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
ref class B {  
};  
  
ref class D : private B {   // C3628  
  
// The following line resolves the error.  
// ref class D : public B {  
};  
  
int main() {  
}  
```
