# Compiler Error C3456

> [source_annotation_attribute] not allowed on managed or WinRT class declaration

## Remarks

source_annotation_attribute is used to define custom attributes to be used by code analysis.

These custom attributes are only useful if there is a corresponding plugin that understands the attribute.
