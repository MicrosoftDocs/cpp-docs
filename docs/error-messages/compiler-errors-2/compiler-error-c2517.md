# Compiler Error C2517

> 'identifier' : right of '::' is undefined

## Remarks

The identifier on the right of the scope-resolution operator (`::`) must be a defined member of the class, structure, or union on the left. If no class, structure, or union is named, the identifier on the right must be declared with global scope.
