# Compiler Error C3622
'class' : a class declared as 'keyword' cannot be instantiated  
  
An attempt was made to instantiate a class marked as [abstract](../../windows/abstract-cpp-component-extensions.md). A class marked as `abstract` can be a base class, but it cannot be instantiated.  
  
## Example  
The following sample generates C3622.  
  
```  
// C3622.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
ref class a abstract {};  
  
int main() {  
   a aa;   // C3622  
}  
```
