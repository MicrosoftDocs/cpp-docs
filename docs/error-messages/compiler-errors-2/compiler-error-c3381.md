# Compiler Error C3381

> '*identifier*' : assembly access specifiers are only available in code compiled with a /clr option

## Remarks

A type was declared or defined by using an access specifier, which is only permitted in code compiled by using **`/clr`**.

This error may result from a misplaced **`public`**, **`protected`**, or **`private`** keyword, or a missing colon (**`:`**) after an access specifier within a **`class`** or **`struct`**.

In C++/CLI, native types can be visible outside an assembly, but you can only specify assembly access for native types in a **`/clr`** compilation. For more information, see [Type visibility](../../dotnet/how-to-define-and-consume-classes-and-structs-cpp-cli.md#BKMK_Type_visibility) and [`/clr` (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](../../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md).

## Example

The following example generates C3381. To fix it, first either remove the **`public`** specifier from the `class A` definition, or compile by using the **`/clr`** option. Next, add a colon after **`private`** to specify access for `class B {} b;`. That's because a nested class can't have an assembly access specifier as part of its declaration.

```cpp
// C3381.cpp
// compile with: /c
public class A {   // C3381
    private class B {} b;   // C3381
};
```
