# Compiler Error C3538
in a declarator-list 'auto' must always deduce to the same type  
  
 All the declared variables in a declaration list do not resolve to the same type.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that all `auto` declarations in the list deduce to the same type.  
  
## Example  
 The following statements yield C3538. Each statement declares multiple variables, but each use of the `auto` keyword does not deduce to the same type.  
  
```  
// C3538.cpp  
// Compile with /Zc:auto  
// C3538 expected  
int main()  
{  
// Variable x1 is a pointer to char, but y1 is a double.  
   auto * x1 = "a", y1 = 3.14;    
// Variable c is a char and c1 is char*, but c2, and c3 are pointers to pointers.  
   auto c = 'a', *c1 = &c, * c2 = &c1, * c3 = &c2;   
// Variable x2 is an int, but y2 is a double and z is a char.  
   auto x2(1), y2(0.0), z = 'a';   
// Variable a is a pointer to int, but b is a pointer to double.  
   auto *a = new auto(1), *b = new auto(2.0);   
   return 0;  
}  
```
