# Compiler Error C3495

> 'var': a lambda capture must have automatic storage duration

## Remarks

You cannot capture a variable that does not have automatic storage duration, such as a variable that is marked **`static`** or **`extern`**.

### To correct this error

- Do not pass a **`static`** or **`extern`** variable to the capture list of the lambda expression.

## Example

The following example generates C3495 because the **`static`** variable `n` appears in the capture list of a lambda expression:

```cpp
// C3495.cpp

int main()
{
   static int n = 66;
   [&n]() { return n; }(); // C3495
}
```
