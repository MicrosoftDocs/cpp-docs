# Compiler Error C3888

> 'name' : the const expression associated with this literal data member is not supported by C++/CLI

## Remarks

The *name* data member that is declared with the [literal](../../extensions/literal-cpp-component-extensions.md) keyword is initialized with a value the compiler does not support. The compiler supports only constant integral, enum, or string types. The likely cause for the **C3888** error is that the data member is initialized with a byte array.

### To correct this error

1. Check that the declared literal data member is a supported type.
