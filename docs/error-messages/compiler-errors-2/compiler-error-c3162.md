# Compiler Error C3162
'type' : a reference type which has a destructor cannot be used as the type of static data member 'member'  
  
 The common language runtime cannot know when to run a user-defined destructor when the class also contains static member function.  
  
 A destructor will never be run unless the object is deleted explicitly.  
  
 For more information, see,  
  
-   [/clr (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](../../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md)  
  
-   [Common Visual C++ 64-bit Migration Issues](../../build/common-visual-cpp-64-bit-migration-issues.md)  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C3162.  
  
```  
// C3162.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /c  
ref struct A {  
   ~A() { System::Console::WriteLine("in destructor"); }  
   static A i;   // C3162  
   static A^ a = gcnew A;   // OK  
};  
  
int main() {  
   A ^ a = gcnew A;  
   delete a;  
}  
```
