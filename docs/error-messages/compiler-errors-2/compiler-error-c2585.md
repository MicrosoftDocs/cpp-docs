# Compiler Error C2585
explicit conversion to 'type' is ambiguous  
  
 The type conversion can produce more than one result.  
  
### To fix by checking the following possible causes  
  
1.  Converting from a class or structure type based on multiple inheritance. If the type inherits the same base class more than once, the conversion function or operator must use scope resolution (`::`) to specify which of the inherited classes to use in the conversion.  
  
2.  A conversion operator and a constructor have been defined making the same conversion.
