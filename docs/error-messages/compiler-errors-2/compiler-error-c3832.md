# Compiler Error C3832
'type library': type library looks as if it was built for 32-bit pointers; please change the 'ptrsize' qualifier  
  
 Explicit information supplied with the `ptrsize` attribute of the [#import](../../preprocessor/hash-import-directive-cpp.md) directive did not agree with what the compiler found in the type library.
