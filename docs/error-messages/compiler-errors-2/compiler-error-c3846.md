# Compiler Error C3846
'symbol' : cannot import symbol from 'assembly2': as 'symbol' has already been imported from another assembly 'assembly1'  
  
 A symbol could not be imported from a referenced assembly because it was previously imported from a referenced assembly.  
  
## Example
The following sample generates C3846:  
  
```  
// C3846a.cpp  
// compile with: /LD /clr  
public ref struct G  
{  
};  
```  
  
 And then compile this:  
  
```  
// C3846b.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
#using "c3846a.dll"  
#using "c3846a.obj"   // C3846  
  
int main()  
{  
}  
```
