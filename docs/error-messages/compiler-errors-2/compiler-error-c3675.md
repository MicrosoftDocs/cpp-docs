# Compiler Error C3675
'function' : is reserved because 'property' is defined  
  
 When you declare a simple property, the compiler generates the get and set accessor methods, and those names are present in the scope of your program.  The compiler-generated names are formed by prepending get_ and set_ to the property name.  Therefore, you cannot declare functions with the same name as the compiler-generated accessors.  
  
 See [property](../../windows/property-cpp-component-extensions.md) for more information.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C3675.  
  
```  
// C3675.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /c  
ref struct C {  
public:  
   property int Size;  
   int get_Size() { return 0; }   // C3675  
};  
```
