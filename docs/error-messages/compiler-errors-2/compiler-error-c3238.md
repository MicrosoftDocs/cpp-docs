# Compiler Error C3238
'type' : a type with this name has already been forwarded to assembly 'assembly'  
  
 A type was defined in a client application that is also defined, via type forwarding syntax, in a referenced assembly. Both types cannot be defined in the scope of the application.  
  
 See [Type Forwarding (C++/CLI)](../../windows/type-forwarding-cpp-cli.md) for more information.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample creates an assembly that contains a type that was forwarded from another assembly.  
  
```  
// C3238.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /LD  
public ref class R {};  
```  
  
## Example  
 The following sample creates an assembly that used to contain the type definition, but not only contains type forwarding syntax.  
  
```  
// C3238_b.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /LD  
#using "C3238.dll"  
[ assembly:TypeForwardedTo(R::typeid) ];  
```  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C3238.  
  
```  
// C3238_c.cpp  
// compile with: /clr /c  
// C3238 expected  
// Delete the following line to resolve.  
#using "C3238_b.dll"  
public ref class R {};  
```
