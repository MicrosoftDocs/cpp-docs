# Compiler Error C2801
'operator operator' must be a non-static member  
  
 The following operators can be overloaded only as nonstatic members:  
  
-   Assignment `=`  
  
-   Class member access `->`  
  
-   Subscripting `[]`  
  
-   Function call `()`  
  
 Possible C2801 causes:  
  
-   Overloaded operator is not a class, structure, or union member.  
  
-   Overloaded operator is declared `static`.  
  
-   The following sample generates C2801:  
  
```  
// C2801.cpp  
// compile with: /c  
operator[]();   // C2801 not a member  
class A {  
   static operator->();   // C2801 static  
   operator()();   // OK  
};  
```
