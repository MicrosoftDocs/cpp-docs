# Compiler Error C3492

> 'var': you cannot capture a member of an anonymous union

## Remarks

You cannot capture a member of an unnamed union.

### To correct this error

- Give the union a name and pass the complete union structure to the capture list of the lambda expression.

## Example

The following example generates C3492 because it captures a member of an anonymous union:

```cpp
// C3492a.cpp

int main()
{
   union
   {
      char ch;
      int x;
   };

   ch = 'y';
   [&x](char ch) { x = ch; }(ch); // C3492
}
```

The following example resolves C3492 by giving the union a name and by passing the complete union structure to the capture list of the lambda expression:

```cpp
// C3492b.cpp

int main()
{
   union
   {
      char ch;
      int x;
   } u;

   u.ch = 'y';
   [&u](char ch) { u.x = ch; }(u.ch);
}
```
