# Compiler Error C2675
unary 'operator' : 'type' does not define this operator or a conversion to a type acceptable to the predefined operator  
  
 C2675 can also occur when using a unary operator, and the type does not define the operator or a conversion to a type acceptable to the predefined operator. To use the operator, you must overload it for the specified type or define a conversion to a type for which the operator is defined.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C2675.  
  
```  
// C2675.cpp  
struct C {   
   C(){}  
} c;  
  
struct D {   
   D(){}  
   void operator-(){}  
} d;  
  
int main() {  
   -c;   // C2675  
   -d;   // OK  
}  
```
