# Compiler Error C2541
'delete' : delete : cannot delete objects that are not pointers  
  
 The [delete](../../cpp/delete-operator-cpp.md) operator was used on an object that is not a pointer.  
  
 The following sample generates C2541:  
  
```  
// C2541.cpp  
int main() {  
   int i;  
   delete i;   // C2541 i not a pointer  
  
   // OK  
   int *ip = new int;  
   delete ip;  
}  
```
