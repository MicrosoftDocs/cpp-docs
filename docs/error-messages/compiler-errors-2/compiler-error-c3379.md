# Compiler Error C3379
'class' : a nested class cannot have an assembly access specifier as part of its declaration  
  
 When applied to a managed type, such as class or struct, the [public](../../cpp/public-cpp.md) and [private](../../cpp/private-cpp.md) keywords indicate whether the class will be exposed through assembly metadata. `public` or `private` cannot be applied to a nested class, which will inherit the assembly access of the enclosing class.  
  
 When used with [/clr](../../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md), the `ref` and `value` keywords indicate that a class is managed (see [Classes and Structs](../../windows/classes-and-structs-cpp-component-extensions.md)).  
  
 The following sample generates C3379:  
  
```  
// C3379a.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
using namespace System;  
  
public ref class A {  
public:  
   static int i = 9;  
  
   public ref class BA {   // C3379  
   // try the following line instead  
   // ref class BA {  
   public:  
      static int ii = 8;  
   };  
};  
  
int main() {  
  
   A^ myA = gcnew A;  
   Console::WriteLine(myA->i);  
  
   A::BA^ myBA = gcnew A::BA;  
   Console::WriteLine(myBA->ii);  
}  
```
