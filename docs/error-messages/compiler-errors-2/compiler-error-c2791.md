# Compiler Error C2791
illegal use of 'super': 'class' does not have any base classes  
  
 The keyword [super](../../cpp/super.md) was used within the context of a member function of a class that does not have any base classes.  
  
 The following sample generates C2791:  
  
```  
// C2791.cpp  
struct D {  
   void mf() {  
      __super::mf();   // C2791  
   }  
};  
```
