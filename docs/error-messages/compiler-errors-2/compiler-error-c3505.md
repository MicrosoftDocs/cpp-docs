# Compiler Error C3505

> cannot load type library '*guid*'

## Remarks

C3505 can be caused if you are running the 32-bit, x86-hosted cross-compiler for 64-bit, x64 targets on a 64-bit machine, because the compiler is running under WOW64 and can only read from the 32-bit registry hive.

You can resolve this error by building both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the type library you are trying to import, and then register them both.  Or you can use the native 64-bit compiler, which requires you to change your **VC++ Directories** property in the IDE to point to the 64-bit compiler.
