# Override Specifiers  (C++/CLI and C++/CX)

*Override specifiers* modify how inherited types and members of inherited types behave in derived types.

## All Runtimes

### Remarks

For more information about override specifiers, see:

- [abstract](abstract-cpp-component-extensions.md)

- [new (new slot in vtable)](new-new-slot-in-vtable-cpp-component-extensions.md)

- [override](override-cpp-component-extensions.md)

- [sealed](sealed-cpp-component-extensions.md)

- [Override Specifiers and Native Compilations](../dotnet/how-to-declare-override-specifiers-in-native-compilations-cpp-cli.md)

**abstract** and **sealed** are also valid on type declarations, where they do not act as override specifiers.

For information about explicitly overriding base class functions, see [Explicit Overrides](explicit-overrides-cpp-component-extensions.md).
