# ref class and ref struct (C++/CLI and C++/CX)

The **ref class** or **ref struct** extensions declare a class or struct whose *object lifetime* is administered automatically. When the object is no longer accessible or goes out of scope, the memory is released.

## All Runtimes

### Syntax

```cpp
class_access ref class name modifier : inherit_access base_type {};
class_access ref struct name modifier : inherit_access base_type {};
class_access value class name modifier : inherit_access base_type {};
class_access value struct name modifier : inherit_access base_type {};
```

### Parameters

*class_access*<br/>
(Optional) The accessibility of the class or struct outside the assembly. Possible values are **`public`** and **`private`** (**`private`** is the default). Nested classes or structs cannot have a *class_access* specifier.

*name*<br/>
The name of the class or struct.

*modifier*<br/>
(Optional) [abstract](abstract-cpp-component-extensions.md) and [sealed](sealed-cpp-component-extensions.md) are valid modifiers.

*inherit_access*<br/>
(Optional) The accessibility of *base_type*. The only permitted accessibility is **`public`** (**`public`** is the default).

*base_type*<br/>
(Optional) A base type. However, a value type cannot act as a base type.

For more information, see the language-specific descriptions of this parameter in the Windows Runtime and Common Language Runtime sections.

### Remarks

The default member accessibility of an object declared with **ref class** or **value class** is **`private`**. And the default member accessibility of an object declared with **ref struct** or **value struct** is **`public`**.

When a reference type inherits from another reference type, virtual functions in the base class must explicitly be overridden (with [override](override-cpp-component-extensions.md)) or hidden (with [new (new slot in vtable)](new-new-slot-in-vtable-cpp-component-extensions.md)). The derived class functions must also be explicitly marked as **`virtual`**.

To detect at compile time whether a type is a **ref class** or **ref struct**, or a **value class** or **value struct**, use `__is_ref_class (type)`, `__is_value_class (type)`, or `__is_simple_value_class (type)`. For more information, see [Compiler Support for Type Traits](compiler-support-for-type-traits-cpp-component-extensions.md).

## Windows Runtime

### Remarks

See [Ref classes and structs](../cppcx/ref-classes-and-structs-c-cx.md) and [Value classes and structs](../cppcx/value-classes-and-structs-c-cx.md).

### Parameters

*base_type*<br/>
(Optional) A base type. A **ref class** or **ref struct** can inherit from zero or more interfaces and zero or one **ref** types. A **value class** or **value struct** can only inherit from zero or more interfaces.

When you declare an object by using the **ref class** or **ref struct** keywords, the object is accessed by a handle to an object; that is, a reference-counter pointer to the object. When the declared variable goes out of scope, the compiler automatically deletes the underlying object. When the object is  used as a parameter in a call or is stored in a variable, a handle to the object is actually passed or stored.

When you declare an object by using the **value class** or **value struct** keywords, the object lifetime of the declared object is not supervised. The object is like any other standard C++ class or struct.

### Requirements

Compiler option: `/ZW`

## Common Language Runtime

### Remarks

The following table lists differences from the syntax shown in the **All Runtimes** section that are specific to C++/CLI.

### Parameters

*base_type*<br/>
(Optional) A base type. A **ref class** or **ref struct** can inherit from zero or more managed interfaces and zero or one ref types. A **value class** or **value struct** can only inherit from zero or more managed interfaces.

The **ref class** and **ref struct** keywords tell the compiler that the class or structure is to be allocated on the heap. When the object is  used as a parameter in a call or is stored in a variable, a reference to the object is actually passed or stored.

The **value class** and **value struct** keywords tells the compiler that the value of the allocated class or structure is passed to functions or stored in members.

### Requirements

Compiler option: `/clr`
