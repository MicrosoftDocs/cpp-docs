# Implementation-Defined Behavior

ANSI X3.159-1989, *American National Standard for Information Systems* - *Programming Language* - *C*, contains a section called "Portability Issues." The ANSI section lists areas of the C language that ANSI leaves open to each particular implementation. This section describes how Microsoft C handles these implementation-defined areas of the C language.

This section follows the same order as the ANSI section. Each item covered includes references to the ANSI that explains the implementation-defined behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> This section describes the U.S. English-language version of the C compiler only. Implementations of Microsoft C for other languages may differ slightly.
