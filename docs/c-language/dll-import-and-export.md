# DLL Import and Export

**Microsoft Specific**

The dllimport and dllexport storage-class modifiers are Microsoft-specific extensions to the C language. These modifiers define the DLL's interface to its client (the executable file or another DLL). For specific information about using these modifiers, see [dllexport, dllimport](../cpp/dllexport-dllimport.md).
