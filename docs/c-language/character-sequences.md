# Character Sequences
**ANSI 3.8.2** The mapping of source file character sequences  
  
 Preprocessor statements use the same character set as source file statements with the exception that escape sequences are not supported.  
  
 Thus, to specify a path for an include file, use only one backslash:  
  
```  
#include "path1\path2\myfile"  
```  
  
 Within source code, two backslashes are necessary:  
  
```  
fil = fopen( "path1\\path2\\myfile", "rt" );  
```
