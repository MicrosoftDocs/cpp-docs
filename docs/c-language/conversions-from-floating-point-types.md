# Conversions from floating-point types

A **float** value converted to a **double** or **long double**, or a **double** converted to a **long double**, undergoes no change in value. A **double** value converted to a **float** value is represented exactly, if possible. Precision may be lost if the value cannot be represented exactly. If the result is out of range, the behavior is undefined. See [Limits on Floating-Point Constants](../c-language/limits-on-floating-point-constants.md) for the range of floating-point types.

A floating value is converted to an integral value by first converting to a **long**, then from the **long** value to the specific integral value. The decimal portion of the floating value is discarded in the conversion to a **long**. If the result is still too large to fit into a **long**, the result of the conversion is undefined.

**Microsoft Specific**

When converting a **double** or **long double** floating-point number to a smaller floating-point number, the value of the floating-point variable is truncated toward zero when an underflow occurs. An overflow causes a run-time error. Note that the Microsoft C compiler maps **long double** to type **double**.

**END Microsoft Specific**

The following table summarizes conversions from floating types.

## Conversions from floating-point types

|From|To|Method|
|----------|--------|------------|
|**float**|**char**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to **char**|
|**float**|**short**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to **short**|
|**float**|**long**|Truncate at decimal point. If result is too large to be represented as **long**, result is undefined.|
|**float**|**unsigned short**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to **unsigned short**|
|**float**|**unsigned long**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to **unsigned long**|
|**float**|**double**|Change internal representation|
|**float**|**long double**|Change internal representation|
|**double**|**char**|Convert to **float**; convert **float** to **char**|
|**double**|**short**|Convert to **float**; convert **float** to **short**|
|**double**|**long**|Truncate at decimal point. If result is too large to be represented as **long**, result is undefined.|
|**double**|**unsigned short**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to **unsigned short**|
|**double**|**unsigned long**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to **unsigned long**|
|**double**|**float**|Represent as a **float**. If **double** value cannot be represented exactly as **float**, loss of precision occurs. If value is too large to be represented as **float**, the result is undefined.|
|**long double**|**char**|Convert to **float**; convert **float** to **char**|
|**long double**|**short**|Convert to **float**; convert **float** to **short**|
|**long double**|**long**|Truncate at decimal point. If result is too large to be represented as **long**, result is undefined.|
|**long double**|**unsigned short**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to **unsigned short**|
|**long double**|**unsigned long**|Convert to **long**; convert **long** to **unsigned long**|
|**long double**|**float**|Represent as a **float**. If **double** value cannot be represented exactly as **float**, loss of precision occurs. If value is too large to be represented as **float**, the result is undefined.|
|**long double**|**double**|The **long double** value is treated as **double**.|

Conversions from **float**, **double**, or **long double** values to **unsigned long** are not accurate if the value being converted is larger than the maximum positive **long** value.
