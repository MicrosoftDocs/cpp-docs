# Default Date and Time
**ANSI 3.8.8** The definitions for _DATE\_ and _TIME\_ when, respectively, the date and time of translation are not available  
  
 When the operating system does not provide the date and time of translation, the default values for _DATE\_ and _TIME\_ are `May 03 1957` and `17:00:00"`.
