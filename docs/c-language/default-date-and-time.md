# Default Date and Time

**ANSI 3.8.8** The definitions for `__DATE__` and `__TIME__` when, respectively, the date and time of translation are not available

When the operating system does not provide the date and time of translation, the default values for `__DATE__` and `__TIME__` are `May 03 1957` and `17:00:00`.
