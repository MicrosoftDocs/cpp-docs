# Statements (C)

The statements of a C program control the flow of program execution. In C, as in other programming languages, several kinds of statements are available to perform loops, to select other statements to be executed, and to transfer control. Following a brief [overview of statement syntax](../c-language/overview-of-c-statements.md), this section describes the C statements in alphabetical order:

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      [break statement](../c-language/break-statement-c.md)\
      [compound statement](../c-language/compound-statement-c.md)\
      [continue statement](../c-language/continue-statement-c.md)\
      [do-while statement](../c-language/do-while-statement-c.md)\
      [expression statement](../c-language/expression-statement-c.md)
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      [for statement](../c-language/for-statement-c.md)\
      [goto and labeled statements](../c-language/goto-and-labeled-statements-c.md)\
      [if statement](../c-language/if-statement-c.md)\
      [null statement](../c-language/null-statement-c.md)\
      [return statement](../c-language/return-statement-c.md)
