# Statements (C)
The statements of a C program control the flow of program execution. In C, as in other programming languages, several kinds of statements are available to perform loops, to select other statements to be executed, and to transfer control. Following a brief [overview of statement syntax](../c-language/overview-of-c-statements.md), this section describes the C statements in alphabetical order:  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[break statement](../c-language/break-statement-c.md)|[if statement](../c-language/if-statement-c.md)|  
|[compound statement](../c-language/compound-statement-c.md)|[null statement](../c-language/null-statement-c.md)|  
|[continue statement](../c-language/continue-statement-c.md)|[return statement](../c-language/return-statement-c.md)|  
|[do-while statement](../c-language/do-while-statement-c.md)|[switch statement](../c-language/switch-statement-c.md)|  
|[expression statement](../c-language/expression-statement-c.md)|[try-except statement](../c-language/try-except-statement-c.md)|  
|[for statement](../c-language/for-statement-c.md)|[try-finally statement](../c-language/try-finally-statement-c.md)|  
|[goto and labeled statements](../c-language/goto-and-labeled-statements-c.md)|[while statement](../c-language/while-statement-c.md)|
