# Constants in Primary Expressions

A constant operand has the value and type of the constant value it represents. A character constant has **`int`** type. An integer constant has **`int`**, **`long`**, **`unsigned int`**, or **`unsigned long`** type, depending on the integer's size and on the way the value is specified. See [Constants](../c-language/c-constants.md) for more information.
