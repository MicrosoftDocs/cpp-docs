# Incomplete Types

An *incomplete type* is a type that describes an identifier but lacks information needed to determine the size of the identifier. An incomplete type can be:

- A structure type whose members you have not yet specified.

- A union type whose members you have not yet specified.

- An array type whose dimension you have not yet specified.

The **void** type is an incomplete type that cannot be completed. To complete an incomplete type, specify the missing information. The following examples show how to create and complete the incomplete types.

- To create an incomplete structure type, declare a structure type without specifying its members. In this example, the `ps` pointer points to an incomplete structure type called `student`.

    ```C
    struct student *ps;
    ```

- To complete an incomplete structure type, declare the same structure type later in the same scope with its members specified, as in

    ```C
    struct student
    {
        int num;
    }                   /* student structure now completed */
    ```

- To create an incomplete array type, declare an array type without specifying its repetition count. For example:

    ```C
    char a[];  /* a has incomplete type */
    ```

- To complete an incomplete array type, declare the same name later in the same scope with its repetition count specified, as in

    ```C
    char a[25]; /* a now has complete type */
    ```
