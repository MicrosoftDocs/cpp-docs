# Filenames

**ANSI 4.9.3** The rules for composing valid file names

A file specification can include an optional drive letter (always followed by a colon), a series of optional directory names (separated by backslashes), and a filename.

For more information, see [Naming a File](/windows/win32/FileIO/naming-a-file) for more information.
