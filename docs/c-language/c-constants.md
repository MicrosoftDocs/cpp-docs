# C Constants
A "constant" is a number, character, or character string that can be used as a value in a program. Use constants to represent floating-point, integer, enumeration, or character values that cannot be modified.  
  
## Syntax  
 `constant`:  
 *floating-point-constant*  
  
 *integer-constant*  
  
 *enumeration-constant*  
  
 *character-constant*  
  
 Constants are characterized by having a value and a type. [Floating-point](../c-language/c-floating-point-constants.md), [integer](../c-language/c-integer-constants.md), and [character constants](../c-language/c-character-constants.md) are discussed in the next three sections. Enumeration constants are described in [Enumeration Declarations](../c-language/c-enumeration-declarations.md).
