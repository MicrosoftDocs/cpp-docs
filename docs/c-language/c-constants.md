# C Constants

A "constant" is a number, character, or character string that can be used as a value in a program. Use constants to represent floating-point, integer, enumeration, or character values that cannot be modified.

## Syntax

`constant`:<br/>
*floating-point-constant*

*integer-constant*

*enumeration-constant*

*character-constant*

Constants are characterized by having a value and a type. [Floating-point](../c-language/c-floating-point-constants.md), [integer](../c-language/c-integer-constants.md), and [character constants](../c-language/c-character-constants.md) are discussed in the next three sections. Enumeration constants are described in [Enumeration Declarations](../c-language/c-enumeration-declarations.md).
