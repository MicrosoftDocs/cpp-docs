# Translation: Diagnostics
**ANSI 2.1.1.3** How a diagnostic is identified  
  
 Microsoft C produces error messages in the form:  
  
```  
  
filename( line-number ) : diagnostic Cnumbermessage  
```  
  
 where *filename* is the name of the source file in which the error was encountered; *line-number* is the line number at which the compiler detected the error; `diagnostic` is either "error" or "warning"; `number` is a unique four-digit number (preceded by a **C**, as noted in the syntax) that identifies the error or warning; `message` is an explanatory message.
