# Casting Integers to Floating-Point Values
**ANSI 3.2.1.3** The direction of truncation when an integral number is converted to a floating-point number that cannot exactly represent the original value  
  
 When an integral number is cast to a floating-point value that cannot exactly represent the value, the value is rounded (up or down) to the nearest suitable value.  
  
 For example, casting an **unsigned long** (with 32 bits of precision) to a **float** (whose mantissa has 23 bits of precision) rounds the number to the nearest multiple of 256. The **long** values 4,294,966,913 to 4,294,967,167 are all rounded to the **float** value 4,294,967,040.
