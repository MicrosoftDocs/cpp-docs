# Truncation of Floating-Point Values

**ANSI 3.2.1.4** The direction of truncation or rounding when a floating-point number is converted to a narrower floating-point number

When an underflow occurs, the value of a floating-point variable is rounded to zero. An overflow may cause a run-time error or it may produce an unpredictable value, depending on the optimizations specified.
