# Compound Statement (C)

A compound statement (also called a "block") typically appears as the body of another statement, such as the **if** statement. [Declarations and Types](../c-language/declarations-and-types.md) describes the form and meaning of the declarations that can appear at the head of a compound statement.

## Syntax

*compound-statement*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**{** *declaration-list*<sub>opt</sub> *statement-list*<sub>opt</sub> **}**

*declaration-list*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*declaration*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*declaration-list* *declaration*

*statement-list*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*statement*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*statement-list* *statement*

If there are declarations, they must come before any statements. The scope of each identifier declared at the beginning of a compound statement extends from its declaration point to the end of the block. It is visible throughout the block unless a declaration of the same identifier exists in an inner block.

Identifiers in a compound statement are presumed **auto** unless explicitly declared otherwise with **register**, **static**, or `extern`, except functions, which can only be `extern`. You can leave off the `extern` specifier in function declarations and the function will still be `extern`.

Storage is not allocated and initialization is not permitted if a variable or function is declared in a compound statement with storage class `extern`. The declaration refers to an external variable or function defined elsewhere.

Variables declared in a block with the **auto** or **register** keyword are reallocated and, if necessary, initialized each time the compound statement is entered. These variables are not defined after the compound statement is exited. If a variable declared inside a block has the **static** attribute, the variable is initialized when program execution begins and keeps its value throughout the program. See [Storage Classes](../c-language/c-storage-classes.md) for information about **static**.

This example illustrates a compound statement:

```
if ( i > 0 )
{
    line[i] = x;
    x++;
    i--;
}
```

In this example, if `i` is greater than 0, all statements inside the compound statement are executed in order.
