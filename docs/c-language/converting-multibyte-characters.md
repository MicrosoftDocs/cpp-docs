# Converting Multibyte Characters
**ANSI 3.1.3.4** The current locale used to convert multibyte characters into corresponding wide characters (codes) for a wide character constant  
  
 The current locale is the "C" locale by default. It can be changed with the [#pragma setlocale](../preprocessor/setlocale.md).
