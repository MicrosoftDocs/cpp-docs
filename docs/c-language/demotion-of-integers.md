# Demotion of Integers

**ANSI 3.2.1.2** The result of converting an integer to a shorter signed integer, or the result of converting an unsigned integer to a signed integer of equal length, if the value cannot be represented

When a **`long`** integer is cast to a **`short`**, or a **`short`** is cast to a **`char`**, the least-significant bytes are retained.

For example, this line

```
short x = (short)0x12345678L;
```

assigns the value 0x5678 to `x`, and this line

```
char y = (char)0x1234;
```

assigns the value 0x34 to `y`.

When **`signed`** variables are converted to **`unsigned`** and vice-versa, the bit patterns remain the same. For example, casting -2 (0xFFFFFFFE) to an **`unsigned int`** value yields 4294967294 (also 0xFFFFFFFE).
