# Underflow of Floating-Point Values

**ANSI 4.5.1** Whether the mathematics functions set the integer expression `errno` to the value of the macro `ERANGE` on underflow range errors

A floating-point underflow does not set the expression `errno` to `ERANGE`. When a value approaches zero and eventually underflows, the value is set to zero.
