# enum Type

**ANSI 3.5.2.2** The integer type chosen to represent the values of an enumeration type

A variable declared as `enum` is an `int`.
Enumeration (or enum) is a user defined data type in C. It is mainly used to assign names to integral constants; the names make a program easy to read and maintain.
