# Range of char Values

**ANSI 3.2.1.1** Whether a "plain" **`char`** has the same range of values as a **`signed char`** or an **`unsigned char`**

All signed character values range from -128 to 127. All unsigned character values range from 0 to 255.

The [`/J`](../build/reference/j-default-char-type-is-unsigned.md) compiler option changes the default type for **`char`** from **`signed char`** to **`unsigned char`**.
