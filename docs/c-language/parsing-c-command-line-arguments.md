# Parsing C command-line arguments

**Microsoft Specific**

Microsoft C startup code uses the following rules when interpreting arguments given on the operating system command line:

- Arguments are delimited by whitespace characters, which are either spaces or tabs.

- The first argument (`argv[0]`) is treated specially. It represents the program name. Because it must be a valid pathname, parts surrounded by double quote marks (**`"`**) are allowed. The double quote marks aren't included in the `argv[0]` output. The parts surrounded by double quote marks prevent interpretation of a space or tab character as the end of the argument. The later rules in this list don't apply.

- A string surrounded by double quote marks is interpreted as a single argument, whether it contains whitespace characters or not. A quoted string can be embedded in an argument. The caret (**`^`**) isn't recognized as an escape character or delimiter. Within a quoted string, a pair of double quote marks is interpreted as a single escaped double quote mark. If the command line ends before a closing double quote mark is found, then all the characters read so far are output as the last argument.

- A double quote mark preceded by a backslash (**`\"`**) is interpreted as a literal double quote mark (**`"`**).

- Backslashes are interpreted literally, unless they immediately precede a double quote mark.

- If an even number of backslashes is followed by a double quote mark, then one backslash (**`\`**) is placed in the `argv` array for every pair of backslashes (**`\\`**), and the double quote mark (**`"`**) is interpreted as a string delimiter.

- If an odd number of backslashes is followed by a double quote mark, then one backslash (**`\`**) is placed in the `argv` array for every pair of backslashes (**`\\`**). The double quote mark is interpreted as an escape sequence by the remaining backslash, causing a literal double quote mark (**`"`**) to be placed in `argv`.

This list illustrates the rules above by showing the interpreted result passed to `argv` for several examples of command-line arguments. The output listed in the second, third, and fourth columns is from the ARGS.C program that follows the list.

| Command-line input | `argv[1]` | `argv[2]` | `argv[3]` |
|--|--|--|--|
| `"a b c" d e` | `a b c` | `d` | `e` |
| `"ab\"c" "\\" d` | `ab"c` | `\` | `d` |
| `a\\\b d"e f"g h` | `a\\\b` | `de fg` | `h` |
| `a\\\"b c d` | `a\"b` | `c` | `d` |
| `a\\\\"b c" d e` | `a\\b c` | `d` | `e` |
| `a"b"" c d` | `ab"` | `c` | `d` |

## Example

### Code

```c
// ARGS.C illustrates the following variables used for accessing
// command-line arguments and environment variables:
// argc  argv  envp
//

#include <stdio.h>

int main( int argc, // Number of strings in array argv
char *argv[],      // Array of command-line argument strings
char **envp )      // Array of environment variable strings
{
    int count;

    // Display each command-line argument.
    printf_s( "\nCommand-line arguments:\n" );
    for( count = 0; count < argc; count++ )
        printf_s( "  argv[%d]   %s\n", count, argv[count] );

    // Display each environment variable.
    printf_s( "\nEnvironment variables:\n" );
    while( *envp != NULL )
        printf_s( "  %s\n", *(envp++) );

    return;
}
```

One example of output from this program is:

```
Command-line arguments:
  argv[0]   C:\MSC\ARGS.EXE

Environment variables:
  COMSPEC=C:\NT\SYSTEM32\CMD.EXE
  PATH=c:\nt;c:\binb;c:\binr;c:\nt\system32;c:\word;c:\help;c:\msc;c:\;
  PROMPT=[$p]
  TEMP=c:\tmp
  TMP=c:\tmp
  EDITORS=c:\binr
  WINDIR=c:\nt
```
