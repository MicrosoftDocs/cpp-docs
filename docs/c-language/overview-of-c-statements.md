# Overview of C Statements
C statements consist of tokens, expressions, and other statements. A statement that forms a component of another statement is called the "body" of the enclosing statement. Each statement type given by the following syntax is discussed in this section.  
  
## Syntax  
 *statement*:  
 [labeled-statement](../c-language/goto-and-labeled-statements-c.md)  
  
 [compound-statement](../c-language/compound-statement-c.md)  
  
 [expression-statement](../c-language/expression-statement-c.md)  
  
 [selection-statement](../c-language/if-statement-c.md)  
  
 [iteration-statement](../c-language/do-while-statement-c.md)  
  
 [jump-statement](../c-language/break-statement-c.md)  
  
 [try-except-statement](../c-language/try-except-statement-c.md)  
  
 /* Microsoft Specific \*/[try-finally-statement](../c-language/try-finally-statement-c.md) /\* Microsoft Specific \*/  
  
 Frequently the statement body is a "compound statement." A compound statement consists of other statements that can include keywords. The compound statement is delimited by braces (**{ }**). All other C statements end with a semicolon (**;**). The semicolon is a statement terminator.  
  
 The expression statement contains a C expression that can contain the arithmetic or logical operators introduced in [Expressions and Assignments](../c-language/expressions-and-assignments.md). The null statement is an empty statement.  
  
 Any C statement can begin with an identifying label consisting of a name and a colon. Since only the `goto` statement recognizes statement labels, statement labels are discussed with `goto`. See [The goto and Labeled Statements](../c-language/goto-and-labeled-statements-c.md) for more information.
