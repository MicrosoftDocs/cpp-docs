# for Statement (C)

The **for** statement lets you repeat a statement or compound statement a specified number of times. The body of a **for** statement is executed zero or more times until an optional condition becomes false. You can use optional expressions within the **for** statement to initialize and change values during the **for** statement's execution.

## Syntax

*iteration-statement*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**for** **(** *init-expression*<sub>opt</sub> **;** *cond-expression*<sub>opt</sub> **;** *loop-expression*<sub>opt</sub> **)** *statement*

Execution of a **for** statement proceeds as follows:

1. The *init-expression*, if any, is evaluated. This specifies the initialization for the loop. There is no restriction on the type of *init-expression*.

2. The *cond-expression*, if any, is evaluated. This expression must have arithmetic or pointer type. It is evaluated before each iteration. Three results are possible:

   - If *cond-expression* is **true** (nonzero), *statement* is executed; then *loop-expression*, if any, is evaluated. The *loop-expression* is evaluated after each iteration. There is no restriction on its type. Side effects will execute in order. The process then begins again with the evaluation of *cond-expression*.

   - If *cond-expression* is omitted, *cond-expression* is considered true, and execution proceeds exactly as described in the previous paragraph. A **for** statement without a *cond-expression* argument terminates only when a **break** or **return** statement within the statement body is executed, or when a **goto** (to a labeled statement outside the **for** statement body) is executed.

   - If *cond-expression* is **false** (0), execution of the **for** statement terminates and control passes to the next statement in the program.

A **for** statement also terminates when a **break**, **goto**, or **return** statement within the statement body is executed. A **continue** statement in a **for** loop causes *loop-expression* to be evaluated. When a **break** statement is executed inside a **for** loop, *loop-expression* is not evaluated or executed. This statement

```C
for( ; ; )
```

is the customary way to produce an infinite loop which can only be exited with a **break**, **goto**, or **return** statement.

## Example

This example illustrates the **for** statement:

```C
// c_for.c
int main()
{
   char* line = "H e  \tl\tlo World\0";
   int space = 0;
   int tab = 0;
   int i;
   int max = strlen(line);
   for (i = 0; i < max; i++ )
   {
      if ( line[i] == ' ' )
      {
          space++;
      }
      if ( line[i] == '\t' )
      {
          tab++;
      }
   }

   printf("Number of spaces: %i\n", space);
   printf("Number of tabs: %i\n", tab);
   return 0;
}
```

## Output  
  
```Output
Number of spaces: 4
Number of tabs: 2
```
