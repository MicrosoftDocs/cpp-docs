# Null Statement (C)
A "null statement" is a statement containing only a semicolon; it can appear wherever a statement is expected. Nothing happens when a null statement is executed. The correct way to code a null statement is:  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
;  
  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Statements such as **do**, **for**, **if**, and `while` require that an executable statement appear as the statement body. The null statement satisfies the syntax requirement in cases that do not need a substantive statement body.  
  
 As with any other C statement, you can include a label before a null statement. To label an item that is not a statement, such as the closing brace of a compound statement, you can label a null statement and insert it immediately before the item to get the same effect.  
  
 This example illustrates the null statement:  
  
```  
for ( i = 0; i < 10; line[i++] = 0 )  
     ;  
```  
  
 In this example, the loop expression of the **for** statement `line[i++] = 0` initializes the first 10 elements of `line` to 0. The statement body is a null statement, since no further statements are necessary.
