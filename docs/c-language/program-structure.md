-   [The main function and program execution](../c-language/main-function-and-program-execution.md)  
  
-   [Parsing command-line arguments](../c-language/parsing-c-command-line-arguments.md)  
  
-   [Lifetime, scope, visibility, and linkage](../c-language/lifetime-scope-visibility-and-linkage.md)  
  
-   [Name spaces](../c-language/name-spaces.md)
