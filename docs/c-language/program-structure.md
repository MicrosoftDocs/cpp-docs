- [Source files and source programs](../c-language/source-files-and-source-programs.md)

- [The main function and program execution](../c-language/main-function-and-program-execution.md)

- [Parsing command-line arguments](../c-language/parsing-c-command-line-arguments.md)

- [Lifetime, scope, visibility, and linkage](../c-language/lifetime-scope-visibility-and-linkage.md)

- [Name spaces](../c-language/name-spaces.md)

Because this section is an overview, the topics discussed contain introductory material only. See the cross-referenced information for more detailed explanations.
