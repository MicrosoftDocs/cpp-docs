# switch Statement (C)
The `switch` and **case** statements help control complex conditional and branching operations. The `switch` statement transfers control to a statement within its body.  
  
## Syntax

*selection-statement*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**switch (** *expression* **)** *statement*  
  
*labeled-statement*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**case**  *constant-expression*  **:**  *statement*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**default :**  *statement*  
  
Control passes to the statement whose **case** *constant-expression* matches the value of **switch (** *expression* **)**. The `switch` statement can include any number of **case** instances, but no two case constants within the same `switch` statement can have the same value. Execution of the statement body begins at the selected statement and proceeds until the end of the body or until a **break** statement transfers control out of the body.  
  
Use of the `switch` statement usually looks something like this:  

**switch** ( *expression* )  
**{**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*declarations*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/\* . . . \*/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**case** *constant-expression* **:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/\* statements executed if the expression equals the \*/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/\* value of this constant-expression \*/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**break;**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**default :**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/\* statements executed if expression does not equal \*/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/\* any case constant-expression \*/  
**}**

You can use the **break** statement to end processing of a particular case within the `switch` statement and to branch to the end of the `switch` statement. Without **break**, the program continues to the next case, executing the statements until a **break** or the end of the statement is reached. In some situations, this continuation may be desirable.

The **default** statement is executed if no **case** *constant-expression* is equal to the value of **switch (** *expression* **)**. If the **default** statement is omitted, and no **case** match is found, none of the statements in the `switch` body are executed. There can be at most one **default** statement. The **default** statement need not come at the end; it can appear anywhere in the body of the `switch` statement. A **case** or **default** label can only appear inside a `switch` statement.

The type of `switch` *expression* and **case** *constant-expression* must be integral. The value of each **case** *constant-expression* must be unique within the statement body.

The **case** and **default** labels of the `switch` statement body are significant only in the initial test that determines where execution starts in the statement body. Switch statements can be nested. Any static variables are initialized before executing into any `switch` statements.

> [!NOTE]
> Declarations can appear at the head of the compound statement forming the `switch` body, but initializations included in the declarations are not performed. The `switch` statement transfers control directly to an executable statement within the body, bypassing the lines that contain initializations.

The following examples illustrate `switch` statements:

```C
switch( c )
{
    case 'A':
        capa++;
    case 'a':
        lettera++;
    default :
        total++;
}
```

All three statements of the `switch` body in this example are executed if `c` is equal to `'A'` since a **break** statement does not appear before the following case. Execution control is transferred to the first statement (`capa++;`) and continues in order through the rest of the body. If `c` is equal to `'a'`, `lettera` and `total` are incremented. Only `total` is incremented if `c` is not equal to `'A'` or `'a'`.

```C
switch( i )
{
    case -1:
        n++;
        break;
    case 0 :
        z++;
        break;
    case 1 :
        p++;
        break;
}
```

In this example, a **break** statement follows each statement of the `switch` body. The **break** statement forces an exit from the statement body after one statement is executed. If `i` is equal to -1, only `n` is incremented. The **break** following the statement `n++;` causes execution control to pass out of the statement body, bypassing the remaining statements. Similarly, if `i` is equal to 0, only `z` is incremented; if `i` is equal to 1, only `p` is incremented. The final **break** statement is not strictly necessary, since control passes out of the body at the end of the compound statement, but it is included for consistency.  
  
A single statement can carry multiple **case** labels, as the following example shows:  
  
```C
case 'a' :  
case 'b' :  
case 'c' :  
case 'd' :  
case 'e' :  
case 'f' :  hexcvt(c);  
```  
  
In this example, if *constant-expression* equals any letter between `'a'` and `'f'`, the `hexcvt` function is called.  
  
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
Microsoft C does not limit the number of case values in a `switch` statement. The number is limited only by the available memory. ANSI C requires at least 257 case labels be allowed in a `switch` statement.  
  
The default for Microsoft C is that the Microsoft extensions are enabled. Use the /Za compiler option to disable these extensions.
