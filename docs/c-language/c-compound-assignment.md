# C Compound Assignment
The compound-assignment operators combine the simple-assignment operator with another binary operator. Compound-assignment operators perform the operation specified by the additional operator, then assign the result to the left operand. For example, a compound-assignment expression such as  
  
```  
  
expression1  
+=  
expression2  
  
```  
  
 can be understood as  
  
```  
  
expression1  
=  
expression1  
+  
expression2  
  
```  
  
 However, the compound-assignment expression is not equivalent to the expanded version because the compound-assignment expression evaluates *expression1* only once, while the expanded version evaluates *expression1* twice: in the addition operation and in the assignment operation.  
  
 The operands of a compound-assignment operator must be of integral or floating type. Each compound-assignment operator performs the conversions that the corresponding binary operator performs and restricts the types of its operands accordingly. The addition-assignment (`+=`) and subtraction-assignment (**-=**) operators can also have a left operand of pointer type, in which case the right-hand operand must be of integral type. The result of a compound-assignment operation has the value and type of the left operand.  
  
```  
#define MASK 0xff00  
  
n &= MASK;  
```  
  
 In this example, a bitwise-inclusive-AND operation is performed on `n` and `MASK`, and the result is assigned to `n`. The manifest constant `MASK` is defined with a [#define](../preprocessor/hash-define-directive-c-cpp.md) preprocessor directive.
