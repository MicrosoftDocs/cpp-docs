# Storage-Class Specifiers for Internal-Level Declarations
You can use any of four *storage-class-specifier* terminals for variable declarations at the internal level. When you omit the *storage-class-specifier* from such a declaration, the default storage class is **auto**. Therefore, the keyword **auto** is rarely seen in a C program.
