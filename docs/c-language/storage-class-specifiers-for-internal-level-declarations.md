# Storage-Class Specifiers for Internal-Level Declarations

You can use any of four *`storage-class-specifier`* terminals for variable declarations at the internal level. When you omit the *`storage-class-specifier`* from such a declaration, the default storage class is **`auto`**. Therefore, the keyword **`auto`** is rarely seen in a C program.
