# Storage of Basic Types
The following table summarizes the storage associated with each basic type.  
  
### Sizes of Fundamental Types  
  
|Type|Storage|  
|----------|-------------|  
|`char`, `unsigned char`, **signed char**|1 byte|  
|**short**, **unsigned short**|2 bytes|  
|`int`, `unsigned int`|4 bytes|  
|**long**, `unsigned long`|4 bytes|  
|**float**|4 bytes|  
|**double**|8 bytes|  
|`long double`|8 bytes|  
  
 The C data types fall into general categories. The "integral types" include `char`, `int`, **short**, **long**, **signed**, `unsigned`, and `enum`. The "floating types" include **float**, **double**, and `long double`. The "arithmetic types" include all floating and integral types.
