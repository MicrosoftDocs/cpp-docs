# do-while Statement (C)

The *do-while* statement lets you repeat a statement or compound statement until a specified expression becomes false.

## Syntax

*iteration-statement*:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**do**  *statement*  **while (**  *expression*  **) ;**

The *expression* in a *do-while* statement is evaluated after the body of the loop is executed. Therefore, the body of the loop is always executed at least once.

The *expression* must have arithmetic or pointer type. Execution proceeds as follows:

1. The statement body is executed.

2. Next, *expression* is evaluated. If *expression* is false, the *do-while* statement terminates and control passes to the next statement in the program. If *expression* is true (nonzero), the process is repeated, beginning with step 1.

The *do-while* statement can also terminate when a **break**, **goto**, or **return** statement is executed within the statement body.

This is an example of the *do-while* statement:

```C
do
{  
    y = f( x );  
    x--;  
} while ( x > 0 );  
```

In this *do-while* statement, the two statements `y = f( x );` and `x--;` are executed, regardless of the initial value of `x`. Then `x > 0` is evaluated. If `x` is greater than 0, the statement body is executed again and `x > 0` is reevaluated. The statement body is executed repeatedly as long as `x` remains greater than 0. Execution of the *do-while* statement terminates when `x` becomes 0 or negative. The body of the loop is executed at least once.
