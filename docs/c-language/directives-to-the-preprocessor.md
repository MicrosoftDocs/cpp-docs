# Directives to the Preprocessor
A "directive" instructs the C preprocessor to perform a specific action on the text of the program before compilation. [Preprocessor directives](../preprocessor/preprocessor-directives.md) are fully described in the *Preprocessor Reference*. This example uses the preprocessor directive `#define`:  
  
```  
#define MAX 100  
```  
  
 This statement tells the compiler to replace each occurrence of `MAX` by `100` before compilation. The C compiler preprocessor directives are:  
  
|#define|#endif|#ifdef|#line|  
|--------------|-------------|-------------|------------|  
|`#elif`|`#error`|**#ifndef**|**#pragma**|  
|`#else`|`#if`|`#include`|`#undef`|
