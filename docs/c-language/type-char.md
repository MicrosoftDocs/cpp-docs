# Type char
The `char` type is used to store the integer value of a member of the representable character set. That integer value is the ASCII code corresponding to the specified character.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Character values of type `unsigned char` have a range from 0 to 0xFF hexadecimal. A **signed char** has range 0x80 to 0x7F. These ranges translate to 0 to 255 decimal, and -128 to +127 decimal, respectively. The /J compiler option changes the default from **signed** to `unsigned`.
