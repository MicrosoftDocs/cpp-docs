# C Language Reference
The *C Language Reference* describes the C programming language as implemented in Microsoft C. The book's organization is based on the ANSI C standard with additional material on the Microsoft extensions to the ANSI C standard.  
  
-   [Organization of the C Language Reference](../c-language/organization-of-the-c-language-reference.md)  
  
 For additional reference material on C++ and the preprocessor, see:  
  
-   [C++ Language Reference](../cpp/cpp-language-reference.md)  
  
-   [Preprocessor Reference](../preprocessor/c-cpp-preprocessor-reference.md)  
  
 Compiler and linker options are documented in the [C/C++ Building Reference](../build/reference/c-cpp-building-reference.md).
