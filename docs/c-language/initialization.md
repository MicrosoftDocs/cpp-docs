# Initialization
An "initializer" is a value or a sequence of values to be assigned to the variable being declared. You can set a variable to an initial value by applying an initializer to the declarator in the variable declaration. The value or values of the initializer are assigned to the variable.  
  
 The following sections describe how to initialize variables of [scalar](../c-language/initializing-scalar-types.md), [aggregate](../c-language/initializing-aggregate-types.md), and [string](../c-language/initializing-strings.md) types. "Scalar types" include all the arithmetic types, plus pointers. "Aggregate types" include arrays, structures, and unions.
