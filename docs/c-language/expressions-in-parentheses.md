# Expressions in Parentheses
You can enclose any operand in parentheses without changing the type or value of the enclosed expression. For example, in the expression:  
  
```  
( 10 + 5 ) / 5  
```  
  
 the parentheses around `10 + 5` mean that the value of `10 + 5` is evaluated first and it becomes the left operand of the division (**/**) operator. The result of `( 10 + 5 ) / 5` is 3. Without the parentheses, `10 + 5 / 5` would evaluate to 11.  
  
 Although parentheses affect the way operands are grouped in an expression, they cannot guarantee a particular order of evaluation in all cases. For example, neither the parentheses nor the left-to-right grouping of the following expression guarantees what the value of `i` will be in either of the subexpressions:  
  
```  
( i++ +1 ) * ( 2 + i )  
```  
  
 The compiler is free to evaluate the two sides of the multiplication in any order. If the initial value of `i` is zero, the whole expression could be evaluated as either of these two statements:  
  
```  
( 0 + 1 + 1 ) * ( 2 + 1 )   
( 0 + 1 + 1 ) * ( 2 + 0 )  
```  
  
 Exceptions resulting from side effects are discussed in [Side Effects](../c-language/side-effects.md).
