# C Language Syntax Summary
This section gives the full description of the C language and the Microsoft-specific C language features. You can use the syntax notation in this section to determine the exact syntax for any language component. The explanation for the syntax appears in the section of this manual where a topic is discussed.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This syntax summary is not part of the ANSI C standard, but is included for information only. Microsoft-specific syntax is noted in comments following the syntax.
