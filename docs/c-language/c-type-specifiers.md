# C Type Specifiers

Type specifiers in declarations define the type of a variable or function declaration.

## Syntax

*type-specifier*:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**void**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**char**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**short**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**int**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**long**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**float**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**double**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**signed**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**unsigned**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*struct-or-union-specifier*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*enum-specifier*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*typedef-name*  

The **signed char**, **signed int**, **signed short int**, and **signed long int** types, together with their **unsigned** counterparts and **enum**, are called *integral* types. The **float**, **double**, and **long double** type specifiers are referred to as *floating* or *floating-point* types. You can use any integral or floating-point type specifier in a variable or function declaration. If a *type-specifier* is not provided in a declaration, it is taken to be **int**.

The optional keywords **signed** and **unsigned** can precede or follow any of the integral types, except **enum**, and can also be used alone as type specifiers, in which case they are understood as **signed int** and **unsigned int**, respectively. When used alone, the keyword **int** is assumed to be **signed**. When used alone, the keywords **long** and **short** are understood as **long int** and **short int**.

Enumeration types are considered basic types. Type specifiers for enumeration types are discussed in [Enumeration Declarations](../c-language/c-enumeration-declarations.md).

The keyword **void** has three uses: to specify a function return type, to specify an argument-type list for a function that takes no arguments, and to specify a pointer to an unspecified type. You can use the **void** type to declare functions that return no value or to declare a pointer to an unspecified type. See [Arguments](../c-language/arguments.md) for information on **void** when it appears alone within the parentheses following a function name.

**Microsoft Specific**

Type checking is now ANSI-compliant, which means that type **short** and type **int** are distinct types. For example, this is a redefinition in the Microsoft C compiler that was accepted by previous versions of the compiler.

```C
int   myfunc();
short myfunc();
```

This next example also generates a warning about indirection to different types:

```C
int *pi;
short *ps;

ps = pi;  /* Now generates warning */
```

The Microsoft C compiler also generates warnings for differences in sign. For example:

```C
signed int *pi;
unsigned int *pu

pi = pu;  /* Now generates warning */
```

Type **void** expressions are evaluated for side effects. You cannot use the (nonexistent) value of an expression that has type **void** in any way, nor can you convert a **void** expression (by implicit or explicit conversion) to any type except **void**. If you do use an expression of any other type in a context where a **void** expression is required, its value is discarded.

To conform to the ANSI specification, <strong>void\*\*</strong> cannot be used as <strong>int\*\*</strong>. Only **void**<strong>\*</strong> can be used as a pointer to an unspecified type.

**END Microsoft Specific**

You can create additional type specifiers with **typedef** declarations, as described in [Typedef Declarations](../c-language/typedef-declarations.md). See [Storage of Basic Types](../c-language/storage-of-basic-types.md) for information on the size of each type.
