# Example Program
The following C source program consists of two source files. It gives an overview of some of the various declarations and definitions possible in a C program. Later sections in this book describe how to write these declarations, definitions, and initializations, and how to use C keywords such as **static** and `extern`. The `printf` function is declared in the C header file STDIO.H.  
  
 The `main` and `max` functions are assumed to be in separate files, and execution of the program begins with the `main` function. No explicit user functions are executed before `main`.  
  
```  
/*****************************************************************  
                    FILE1.C - main function  
*****************************************************************/  
  
#define ONE     1  
#define TWO     2  
#define THREE   3  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int a = 1;                       // Defining declarations      
int b = 2;                       //  of external variables      
  
extern int max( int a, int b );  // Function prototype          
  
int main()                       // Function definition         
{                                //  for main function          
    int c;                       // Definitions for      
    int d;                       //  two uninitialized  
                                 //  local variables  
  
    extern int u;                // Referencing declaration     
                                 //  of external variable       
                                 //  defined elsewhere          
    static int v;                // Definition of variable      
                                 //  with continuous lifetime   
  
    int w = ONE, x = TWO, y = THREE;  
    int z = 0;  
  
    z = max( x, y );             // Executable statements      
    w = max( z, w );  
    printf_s( "%d %d\n", z, w );  
    return 0;  
}  
  
/****************************************************************  
            FILE2.C - definition of max function  
****************************************************************/  
  
int max( int a, int b )          // Note formal parameters are     
                                 //  included in function header   
{  
    if( a > b )  
        return( a );  
    else  
        return( b );  
}  
```  
  
 FILE1.C contains the prototype for the `max` function. This kind of declaration is sometimes called a "forward declaration" because the function is declared before it is used. The definition for the `main` function includes calls to `max`.  
  
 The lines beginning with `#define` are preprocessor directives. These directives tell the preprocessor to replace the identifiers `ONE`, `TWO`, and `THREE` with the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3`, respectively, throughout FILE1.C. However, the directives do not apply to FILE2.C, which is compiled separately and then linked with FILE1.C. The line beginning with `#include` tells the compiler to include the file STDIO.H, which contains the prototype for the `printf` function. [Preprocessor directives](../preprocessor/preprocessor-directives.md) are explained in the *Preprocessor Reference*.  
  
 FILE1.C uses defining declarations to initialize the global variables `a` and `b`. The local variables `c` and `d` are declared but not initialized. Storage is allocated for all these variables. The static and external variables, `u` and `v`, are automatically initialized to 0. Therefore only `a`, `b`, `u`, and `v` contain meaningful values when declared because they are initialized, either explicitly or implicitly. FILE2.C contains the function definition for `max`. This definition satisfies the calls to `max` in FILE1.C.  
  
 The lifetime and visibility of identifiers are discussed in [Lifetime, Scope, Visibility, and Linkage](../c-language/lifetime-scope-visibility-and-linkage.md). For more information on functions, see [Functions](../c-language/functions-c.md).
