# Addition (+)
The addition operator (**+**) causes its two operands to be added. Both operands can be either integral or floating types, or one operand can be a pointer and the other an integer.  
  
 When an integer is added to a pointer, the integer value (*i*) is converted by multiplying it by the size of the value that the pointer addresses. After conversion, the integer value represents *i* memory positions, where each position has the length specified by the pointer type. When the converted integer value is added to the pointer value, the result is a new pointer value representing the address *i* positions from the original address. The new pointer value addresses a value of the same type as the original pointer value and therefore is the same as array indexing (see [One-Dimensional Arrays](../c-language/one-dimensional-arrays.md) and [Multidimensional Arrays](../c-language/multidimensional-arrays-c.md)). If the sum pointer points outside the array, except at the first location beyond the high end, the result is undefined. For more information, see [Pointer Arithmetic](../c-language/pointer-arithmetic.md).
