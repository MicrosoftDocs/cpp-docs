# Environment Names
**ANSI 4.10.4.4** The set of environment names and the method for altering the environment list used by the [getenv](../c-runtime-library/reference/getenv-wgetenv.md) function  
  
 The set of environment names is unlimited.  
  
 To change environment variables from within a C program, call the [_putenv](../c-runtime-library/reference/putenv-wputenv.md) function. To change environment variables from the command line in Windows, use the SET command (for example, SET LIB = D:\ LIBS).  
  
 Environment variables set from within a C program exist only as long as their host copy of the operating system command shell is running (CMD.EXE or COMMAND.COM). For example, the line  
  
```  
system( SET LIB = D:\LIBS );  
```  
  
 would run a copy of the command shell (CMD.EXE), set the environment variable LIB, and return to the C program, exiting the secondary copy of CMD.EXE. Exiting that copy of CMD.EXE removes the temporary environment variable LIB.  
  
 Likewise, changes made by the `_putenv` function last only until the program ends.
