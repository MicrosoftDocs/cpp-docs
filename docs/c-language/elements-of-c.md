# Elements of C
This section describes the elements of the C programming language, including the names, numbers, and characters used to construct a C program. The ANSI C syntax labels these components tokens.  
  
 This section explains how to define tokens and how the compiler evaluates them.  
  
 The following topics are discussed:  
  
-   [Tokens](../c-language/c-tokens.md)  
  
-   [Comments](../c-language/c-comments.md)  
  
-   [Keywords](../c-language/c-keywords.md)  
  
-   [Identifiers](../c-language/c-identifiers.md)  
  
-   [Constants](../c-language/c-constants.md)  
  
-   [String literals](../c-language/c-string-literals.md)  
  
-   [Punctuation and special characters](../c-language/punctuation-and-special-characters.md)  
  
 The section also includes reference tables for [Trigraphs](../c-language/trigraphs.md), [Limits on Floating-Point Constants](../c-language/limits-on-floating-point-constants.md), [C++ Integer Limits](../c-language/cpp-integer-limits.md), and [Escape Sequences](../c-language/escape-sequences.md).  
  
 Operators are symbols (both single characters and character combinations) that specify how values are to be manipulated. Each symbol is interpreted as a single unit, called a token. For more information, see [Operators](../c-language/c-operators.md).
