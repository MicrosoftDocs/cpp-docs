# continue Statement (C)

The `continue` statement passes control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing `do`, `for`, or `while` statement in which it appears, bypassing any remaining statements in the `do`, `for`, or `while` statement body.  
  
## Syntax

*jump-statement*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**continue ;**
  
The next iteration of a `do`, `for`, or `while` statement is determined as follows:  
  
-   Within a `do` or a `while` statement, the next iteration starts by reevaluating the expression of the `do` or `while` statement.  
  
-   A `continue` statement in a `for` statement causes the loop expression of the `for` statement to be evaluated. Then the compiler reevaluates the conditional expression and, depending on the result, either terminates or iterates the statement body. See [The for Statement](../c-language/for-statement-c.md) for more information on the `for` statement and its nonterminals.  
  
This is an example of the `continue` statement:  
  
```  
while ( i-- > 0 )   
{  
    x = f( i );  
    if ( x == 1 )  
        continue;  
    y += x * x;  
}  
```  
  
In this example, the statement body is executed while `i` is greater than 0. First `f(i)` is assigned to `x`; then, if `x` is equal to 1, the `continue` statement is executed. The rest of the statements in the body are ignored, and execution resumes at the top of the loop with the evaluation of the loop's test.
