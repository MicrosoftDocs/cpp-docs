# static Storage-Class Specifier
A variable declared at the internal level with the **static** storage-class specifier has a global lifetime but is visible only within the block in which it is declared. For constant strings, using **static** is useful because it alleviates the overhead of frequent initialization in often-called functions.  
  
## Remarks  
If you do not explicitly initialize a **static** variable, it is initialized to 0 by default. Inside a function, **static** causes storage to be allocated and serves as a definition. Internal static variables provide private, permanent storage visible to only a single function.
