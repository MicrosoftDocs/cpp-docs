# goto and Labeled Statements (C)
The `goto` statement transfers control to a label. The given label must reside in the same function and can appear before only one statement in the same function.  
  
## Syntax

*statement*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*labeled-statement*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*jump-statement*

*jump-statement*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**goto**  *identifier*  **;**

*labeled-statement*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*identifier*  **:**  *statement*

A statement label is meaningful only to a `goto` statement; in any other context, a labeled statement is executed without regard to the label.  
  
A *jump-statement* must reside in the same function and can appear before only one statement in the same function. The set of *identifier* names following a `goto` has its own name space so the names do not interfere with other identifiers. Labels cannot be redeclared. See [Name Spaces](../c-language/name-spaces.md) for more information.  
  
It is good programming style to use the **break**, **continue**, and `return` statement in preference to `goto` whenever possible. Since the **break** statement only exits from one level of the loop, a `goto` may be necessary for exiting a loop from within a deeply nested loop.  
  
This example demonstrates the `goto` statement:  
  
```  
// goto.c  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
int main()  
{  
    int i, j;  
  
    for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )  
    {  
        printf_s( "Outer loop executing. i = %d\n", i );  
        for ( j = 0; j < 3; j++ )  
        {  
            printf_s( " Inner loop executing. j = %d\n", j );  
            if ( i == 5 )  
                goto stop;  
        }  
    }  
  
    /* This message does not print: */  
    printf_s( "Loop exited. i = %d\n", i );  
  
    stop: printf_s( "Jumped to stop. i = %d\n", i );  
}  
```  
  
In this example, a `goto` statement transfers control to the point labeled `stop` when `i` equals 5.
