# Customizing C Command-Line Processing
If your program does not take command-line arguments, you can save a small amount of space by suppressing use of the library routine that performs command-line processing. This routine is called **_setargv** (or **_wsetargv** in the wide-character environment), as described in [Expanding Wildcard Arguments](../c-language/expanding-wildcard-arguments.md). To suppress its use, define a routine that does nothing in the file containing the **main** function and name it **_setargv** (or **_wsetargv** in the wide-character environment). The call to **_setargv** or **_wsetargv** is then satisfied by your definition of **_setargv** or **_wsetargv** , and the library version is not loaded.  
  
 Similarly, if you never access the environment table through the `envp` argument, you can provide your own empty routine to be used in place of **_setenvp** (or **_wsetenvp**), the environment-processing routine.  
  
 If your program makes calls to the **_spawn** or **_exec** family of routines in the C run-time library, you should not suppress the environment-processing routine, since this routine is used to pass an environment from the spawning process to the new process.
