# Integer Types
Every integer constant is given a type based on its value and the way it is expressed. You can force any integer constant to type **long** by appending the letter **l** or **L** to the end of the constant; you can force it to be type `unsigned` by appending **u** or **U** to the value. The lowercase letter **l** can be confused with the digit 1 and should be avoided. Some forms of **long** integer constants follow:  
  
```  
/* Long decimal constants */  
10L  
79L  
  
/* Long octal constants */  
012L  
0115L  
  
/* Long hexadecimal constants */  
0xaL or 0xAL  
0X4fL or 0x4FL  
  
/* Unsigned long decimal constant */  
776745UL  
778866LU  
```  
  
 The type you assign to a constant depends on the value the constant represents. A constant's value must be in the range of representable values for its type. A constant's type determines which conversions are performed when the constant is used in an expression or when the minus sign (**-**) is applied. This list summarizes the conversion rules for integer constants.  
  
-   The type for a decimal constant without a suffix is either `int`, **long int**, or **unsigned long int**. The first of these three types in which the constant's value can be represented is the type assigned to the constant.  
  
-   The type assigned to octal and hexadecimal constants without suffixes is `int`, `unsigned int`, **long int**, or **unsigned long int** depending on the size of the constant.  
  
-   The type assigned to constants with a **u** or **U** suffix is **unsigned int** or **unsigned long int** depending on their size.  
  
-   The type assigned to constants with an **l** or **L** suffix is **long int** or **unsigned long int** depending on their size.  
  
-   The type assigned to constants with a **u** or **U** and an **l** or **L** suffix is **unsigned long int**.
