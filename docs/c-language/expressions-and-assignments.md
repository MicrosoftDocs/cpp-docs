# Expressions and Assignments

This section describes how to form expressions and to assign values in the C language. Constants, identifiers, strings, and function calls are all operands that are manipulated in expressions. The C language has all the usual language operators. This section covers those operators as well as operators that are unique to C or Microsoft C. The topics discussed include:

- [L-value and r-value expressions](../c-language/l-value-and-r-value-expressions.md)

- [Constant expressions](../c-language/c-constant-expressions.md)

- [Side effects](../c-language/side-effects.md)

- [Sequence points](../c-language/c-sequence-points.md)

- [Operators](../c-language/c-operators.md)

- [Operator precedence](../c-language/precedence-and-order-of-evaluation.md)

- [Type conversions](../c-language/type-conversions-c.md)

- [Type casts](../c-language/type-cast-conversions.md)
