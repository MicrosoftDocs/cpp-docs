# Internal Linkage

If the declaration of a file-scope identifier for an object or a function contains the *storage-class-specifier* **static**, the identifier has internal linkage. Otherwise, the identifier has external linkage. See [Storage Classes](../c-language/c-storage-classes.md) for a discussion of the *storage-class-specifier* nonterminal.

Within one translation unit, each instance of an identifier with internal linkage denotes the same identifier or function. Internally linked identifiers are unique to a translation unit.
