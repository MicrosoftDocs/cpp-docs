# break Statement (C)

The `break` statement terminates the execution of the nearest enclosing `do`, `for`, `switch`, or `while` statement in which it appears. Control passes to the statement that follows the terminated statement.

## Syntax

*jump-statement*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**break ;**

The `break` statement is frequently used to terminate the processing of a particular case within a `switch` statement. Lack of an enclosing iterative or `switch` statement generates an error.

Within nested statements, the `break` statement terminates only the `do`, `for`, `switch`, or `while` statement that immediately encloses it. You can use a `return` or `goto` statement to transfer control elsewhere out of the nested structure.

This example illustrates the `break` statement:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   char c;
   for(;;) {
      printf_s( "\nPress any key, Q to quit: " );

      // Convert to character value
      scanf_s("%c", &c);
      if (c == 'Q')
          break;
   }
} // Loop exits only when 'Q' is pressed
```
