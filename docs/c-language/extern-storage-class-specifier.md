# extern Storage-Class Specifier

A variable declared with the **extern** storage-class specifier is a reference to a variable with the same name defined in another source file. It is used to make the external-level variable definition visible. A variable declared as **extern** has no storage allocated for itself; it is only a name. 
  
## Example  
 This example illustrates internal- and external-level declarations:  
  
```c  

// Source1.c  

int i = 1;


// Source2. c

#include <stdio.h>  

// Refers to the i that is defined in Source1.c:   
extern int i;

void func(void);

int main()
{
    // Prints 1:   
    printf_s("%d\n", i);
    func();
    return;
}

void func(void)
{
    // Address of global i assigned to pointer variable:  
    static int *external_i = &i;

    // This definition of i hides the global i in Source.c:   
    int i = 16;

    // Prints 16, 1:  
    printf_s("%d\n%d\n", i, *external_i);
}
```  
  
 In this example, the variable `i` is defined in Source1.c with an initial value of 1. An **extern** declaration in Source2.c is makes 'i' visible in that file. 

 In the `func` function, the address of the global variable `i` is used to initialize the **static** pointer variable `external_i`. This works because the global variable has **static** lifetime, meaning its address does not change during program execution. Next, a variable `i` is defined within the scope of `func` as a local variable with initial value 16. This definition does not affect the value of the external-level `i`, which is hidden by the use of its name for the local variable. The value of the global `i` is now accessible only through the pointer `external_i`.
