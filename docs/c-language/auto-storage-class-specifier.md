# auto Storage-Class Specifier
The **auto** storage-class specifier declares an automatic variable, a variable with a local lifetime. An **auto** variable is visible only in the block in which it is declared. Declarations of **auto** variables can include initializers, as discussed in [Initialization](../c-language/initialization.md). Since variables with **auto** storage class are not initialized automatically, you should either explicitly initialize them when you declare them, or assign them initial values in statements within the block. The values of uninitialized **auto** variables are undefined. (A local variable of **auto** or **register** storage class is initialized each time it comes in scope if an initializer is given.)  
  
 An internal **static** variable (a static variable with local or block scope) can be initialized with the address of any external or **static** item, but not with the address of another **auto** item, because the address of an **auto** item is not a constant.
