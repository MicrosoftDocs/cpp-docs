# Conversions from other types

Since an **enum** value is an **int** value by definition, conversions to and from an **enum** value are the same as those for the **int** type. For the Microsoft C compiler, an integer is the same as a **long**.

**Microsoft Specific**

No conversions between structure or union types are allowed.

Any value can be converted to type **void**, but the result of such a conversion can be used only in a context where an expression value is discarded, such as in an expression statement.

The **void** type has no value, by definition. Therefore, it cannot be converted to any other type, and other types cannot be converted to **void** by assignment. However, you can explicitly cast a value to type **void**, as discussed in [Type-Cast Conversions](../c-language/type-cast-conversions.md).
