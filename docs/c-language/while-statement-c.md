# while Statement (C)

The `while` statement lets you repeat a statement until a specified expression becomes false.  
  
## Syntax

*iteration-statement*:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**while (**  *expression*  **)**  *statement*
  
The *expression* must have arithmetic or pointer type. Execution proceeds as follows:  
  
1. The *expression* is evaluated.  
  
2. If *expression* is initially false, the body of the `while` statement is never executed, and control passes from the `while` statement to the next statement in the program.

   If *expression* is true (nonzero), the body of the statement is executed and the process is repeated beginning at step 1.

The `while` statement can also terminate when a **break**, `goto`, or `return` within the statement body is executed. Use the **continue** statement to terminate an iteration without exiting the `while` loop. The **continue** statement passes control to the next iteration of the `while` statement.

This is an example of the `while` statement:

```C
while ( i >= 0 )
{
    string1[i] = string2[i];
    i--;
}
```

This example copies characters from `string2` to `string1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `string2[i]` is assigned to `string1[i]` and `i` is decremented. When `i` reaches or falls below 0, execution of the `while` statement terminates.
