# C Keywords
"Keywords" are words that have special meaning to the C compiler. In translation phases 7 and 8, an identifier cannot have the same spelling and case as a C keyword. (See a description of [translation phases](../preprocessor/phases-of-translation.md) in the *Preprocessor Reference*; for information on identifiers, see [Identifiers](../c-language/c-identifiers.md).) The C language uses the following keywords:  
  
|||||  
|-|-|-|-|  
|**auto**|**double**|**int**|**struct**|  
|**break**|**else**|**long**|**switch**|  
|**case**|**enum**|**register**|**typedef**|  
|**char**|**extern**|**return**|**union**|  
|**const**|**float**|**short**|**unsigned**|  
|**continue**|**for**|**signed**|**void**|  
|**default**|**goto**|**sizeof**|**volatile**|  
|**do**|**if**|**static**|**while**|  
  
 You cannot redefine keywords. However, you can specify text to be substituted for keywords before compilation by using C [preprocessor directives](../preprocessor/preprocessor-directives.md).  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 The ANSI C standard allows identifiers with two leading underscores to be reserved for compiler implementations. Therefore, the Microsoft convention is to precede Microsoft-specific keyword names with double underscores. These words cannot be used as identifier names. For a description of the ANSI rules for naming identifiers, including the use of double underscores, see [Identifiers](../c-language/c-identifiers.md).  
  
 The following keywords and special identifiers are recognized by the Microsoft C compiler:  
  
|||||  
|-|-|-|-|  
|**__asm**|**dllimport**2|**__int8**|**naked**2|  
|**__based**1|**__except**|**__int16**|**__stdcall**|  
|**__cdecl**|**__fastcall**|**__int32**|**thread**2|  
|**__declspec**|**__finally**|**__int64**|**__try**|  
|**dllexport**2|**__inline**|**__leave**||  
  
 1. The **__based** keyword has limited uses for 32-bit and 64-bit target compilations.  
  
 2. These are special identifiers when used with **__declspec**; their use in other contexts is not restricted.  
  
 Microsoft extensions are enabled by default. To ensure that your programs are fully portable, you can disable Microsoft extensions by specifying the /Za option (compile for ANSI compatibility) during compilation. When you do this, Microsoft-specific keywords are disabled.  
  
 When Microsoft extensions are enabled, you can use the keywords listed above in your programs. For ANSI compliance, most of these keywords are prefaced by a double underscore. The four exceptions, **dllexport**, **dllimport**, **naked**, and **thread**, are used only with **__declspec** and therefore do not require a leading double underscore. For backward compatibility, single-underscore versions of the rest of the keywords are supported.
