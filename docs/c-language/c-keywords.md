# C Keywords

"Keywords" are words that have special meaning to the C compiler. In translation phases 7 and 8, an identifier cannot have the same spelling and case as a C keyword. (See a description of [translation phases](../preprocessor/phases-of-translation.md) in the *Preprocessor Reference*; for information on identifiers, see [Identifiers](../c-language/c-identifiers.md).) The C language uses the following keywords:

|||||
|-|-|-|-|
|**auto**|**double**|**int**|**struct**|
|**break**|**else**|**long**|**switch**|
|**case**|**enum**|**register**|**typedef**|
|**char**|**extern**|**return**|**union**|
|**const**|**float**|**short**|**unsigned**|
|**continue**|**for**|**signed**|**void**|
|**default**|**goto**|**sizeof**|**volatile**|
|**do**|**if**|**static**|**while**|

You cannot redefine keywords. However, you can specify text to be substituted for keywords before compilation by using C [preprocessor directives](../preprocessor/preprocessor-directives.md).

**Microsoft Specific**

The ANSI C standard allows identifiers with two leading underscores to be reserved for compiler implementations. Therefore, the Microsoft convention is to precede Microsoft-specific keyword names with double underscores. These words cannot be used as identifier names. For a description of the ANSI rules for naming identifiers, including the use of double underscores, see [Identifiers](../c-language/c-identifiers.md).

The following keywords and special identifiers are recognized by the Microsoft C compiler:

|||||
|-|-|-|-|
|**__asm**<sup>3</sup>|**dllimport**<sup>2</sup>|**__int8**<sup>3</sup>|**naked**<sup>2</sup>|
|**__based**<sup>1, 3</sup>|**__except**<sup>3</sup>|**__int16**<sup>3</sup>|**__stdcall**<sup>3</sup>|
|**__cdecl**<sup>3</sup>|**__fastcall**|**__int32**<sup>3</sup>|**thread**<sup>2</sup>|
|**__declspec**<sup>3</sup>|**__finally**<sup>3</sup>|**__int64**<sup>3</sup>|**__try**<sup>3</sup>|
|**dllexport**<sup>2</sup>|**__inline**<sup>3</sup>|**__leave**<sup>3</sup>||

<sup>1</sup> The **__based** keyword has limited uses for 32-bit and 64-bit target compilations.

<sup>2</sup> These are special identifiers when used with **__declspec**; their use in other contexts is not restricted.

<sup>3</sup> For compatibility with previous versions, these keywords are available both with two leading underscores and a single leading underscore when Microsoft extensions are enabled.

Microsoft extensions are enabled by default. To ensure that your programs are fully portable, you can disable Microsoft extensions by specifying the [/Za \(Disable language extensions)](../build/reference/za-ze-disable-language-extensions.md) option during compilation. When you do this, some Microsoft-specific keywords are disabled.

When Microsoft extensions are enabled, you can use the keywords listed above in your programs. For ANSI compliance, most of these keywords are prefaced by a double underscore. The four exceptions, **dllexport**, **dllimport**, **naked**, and **thread**, are used only with **__declspec** and therefore do not require a leading double underscore. For backward compatibility, single-underscore versions of the rest of the keywords are supported.
