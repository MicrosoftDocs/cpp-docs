# Execution Character Set

This content often refers to the "execution character set." The execution character set is not necessarily the same as the source character set used for writing C programs. The execution character set includes all characters in the source character set as well as the null character, newline character, backspace, horizontal tab, vertical tab, carriage return, and escape sequences. The source and execution character sets may differ in other implementations.
