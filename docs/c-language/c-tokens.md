# C Tokens

In a C source program, the basic element recognized by the compiler is the "token." A token is source-program text that the compiler does not break down into component elements.

## Syntax

*token*:
*keyword*

*identifier*

*constant*

*string-literal*

*operator*

*punctuator*

> [!NOTE]
> See the introduction to [C Language Syntax Summary](../c-language/c-language-syntax-summary.md) for an explanation of the ANSI syntax conventions.

The keywords, identifiers, constants, string literals, and operators described in this section are examples of tokens. Punctuation characters such as brackets (**[ ]**), braces (**{ }**), parentheses ( **( )** ), and commas (**,**) are also tokens.
