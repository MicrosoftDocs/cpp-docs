# C Tokens
In a C source program, the basic element recognized by the compiler is the "token." A token is source-program text that the compiler does not break down into component elements.  
  
## Syntax  
 *token*:  
 *keyword*  
  
 *identifier*  
  
 *constant*  
  
 *string-literal*  
  
 *operator*  
  
 *punctuator*  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  See the introduction to[C Language Syntax Summary](../c-language/c-language-syntax-summary.md) for an explanation of the ANSI syntax conventions.  
  
 The keywords, identifiers, constants, string literals, and operators described in this section are examples of tokens. Punctuation characters such as brackets (**[ ]**), braces (**{ }**), parentheses ( **( )** ), and commas (**,**) are also tokens.
