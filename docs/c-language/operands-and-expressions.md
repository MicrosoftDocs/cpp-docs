# Operands and Expressions
An "operand" is an entity on which an operator acts. An "expression" is a sequence of operators and operands that performs any combination of these actions:  
  
-   Computes a value  
  
-   Designates an object or function  
  
-   Generates side effects  
  
 Operands in C include constants, identifiers, strings, function calls, subscript expressions, member-selection expressions, and complex expressions formed by combining operands with operators or by enclosing operands in parentheses. The syntax for these operands is given in [Primary Expressions](../c-language/c-primary-expressions.md).
