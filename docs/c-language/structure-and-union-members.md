# Structure and Union Members
A "member-selection expression" refers to members of structures and unions. Such an expression has the value and type of the selected member.  
  
> *postfix-expression* **.** *identifier*  
> *postfix-expression* **->** *identifier*
  
This list describes the two forms of the member-selection expressions:  
  
1.  In the first form, *postfix-expression* represents a value of **struct** or **union** type, and *identifier* names a member of the specified structure or union. The value of the operation is that of *identifier* and is an l-value if *postfix-expression* is an l-value. See [L-Value and R-Value Expressions](../c-language/l-value-and-r-value-expressions.md) for more information.  
  
2.  In the second form, *postfix-expression* represents a pointer to a structure or union, and *identifier* names a member of the specified structure or union. The value is that of *identifier* and is an l-value.  
  
 The two forms of member-selection expressions have similar effects.  
  
 In fact, an expression involving the member-selection operator (**->**) is a shorthand version of an expression using the period (**.**) if the expression before the period consists of the indirection operator (<strong>\*</strong>) applied to a pointer value. Therefore,  

```cpp
expression->identifier  
```

is equivalent to  

```cpp
(*expression).identifier
```

 when *expression* is a pointer value.  
  
## Examples  
 The following examples refer to this structure declaration. For information about the indirection operator (<strong>\*</strong>) used in these examples, see [Indirection and Address-of Operators](../c-language/indirection-and-address-of-operators.md).  
  
```  
struct pair   
{  
    int a;  
    int b;  
    struct pair *sp;  
} item, list[10];  
```  
  
 A member-selection expression for the `item` structure looks like this:  
  
```  
item.sp = &item;  
```  
  
 In the example above, the address of the `item` structure is assigned to the `sp` member of the structure. This means that `item` contains a pointer to itself.  
  
```  
(item.sp)->a = 24;  
```  
  
 In this example, the pointer expression `item.sp` is used with the member-selection operator (**->**) to assign a value to the member `a`.  
  
```  
list[8].b = 12;  
```  
  
 This statement shows how to select an individual structure member from an array of structures.
