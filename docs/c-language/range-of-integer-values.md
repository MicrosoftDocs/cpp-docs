# Range of Integer Values

**ANSI 3.1.2.5** The representations and sets of values of the various types of integers

Integers contain 32 bits (four bytes). Signed integers are represented in two's-complement form. The most-significant bit holds the sign: 1 for negative, 0 for positive and zero. The values are listed below:

|Type|Minimum and Maximum|
|----------|-------------------------|
|**`unsigned short`**|0 to 65535|
|**`signed short`**|-32768 to 32767|
|**`unsigned long`**|0 to 4294967295|
|**`signed long`**|-2147483648 to 2147483647|
