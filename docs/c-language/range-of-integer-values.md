# Range of Integer Values
**ANSI 3.1.2.5** The representations and sets of values of the various types of integers  
  
 Integers contain 32 bits (four bytes). Signed integers are represented in two's-complement form. The most-significant bit holds the sign: 1 for negative, 0 for positive and zero. The values are listed below:  
  
|Type|Minimum and Maximum|  
|----------|-------------------------|  
|**unsigned short**|0 to 65535|  
|`signed short`|-32768 to 32767|  
|`unsigned long`|0 to 4294967295|  
|**signed long**|-2147483648 to 2147483647|
