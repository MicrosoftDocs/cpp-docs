# Lifetime, Scope, Visibility, and Linkage

To understand how a C program works, you must understand the rules that determine how variables and functions can be used in the program. Several concepts are crucial to understanding these rules:

- [Lifetime](../c-language/lifetime.md)

- [Scope and visibility](../c-language/scope-and-visibility.md)

- [Linkage](../c-language/linkage.md)
