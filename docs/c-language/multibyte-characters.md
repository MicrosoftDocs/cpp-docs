# Multibyte Characters
**ANSI 2.2.1.2** Shift states for multibyte characters  
  
 Multibyte characters are used by some implementations, including Microsoft C, to represent foreign-language characters not represented in the base character set. However, Microsoft C does not support any state-dependent encodings. Therefore, there are no shift states. See [Multibyte and Wide Characters](../c-language/multibyte-and-wide-characters.md) for more information.
