# Data Type Specifiers and Equivalents
This book generally uses the forms of the type specifiers listed in the following table rather than the long forms, and it assumes that the `char` type is signed by default. Therefore, throughout this book, `char` is equivalent to **signed char**.  
  
### Type Specifiers and Equivalents  
  
|Type Specifier|Equivalent(s)|  
|--------------------|---------------------|  
|**signed char**1|**char**|  
|**signed int**|**signed**, **int**|  
|**signed short int**|**short**, **signed short**|  
|**signed long int**|**long**, **signed long**|  
|**unsigned char**|—|  
|**unsigned int**|**unsigned**|  
|**unsigned short int**|**unsigned short**|  
|**unsigned long int**|**unsigned long**|  
|**float**|—|  
|**long double**2|—|  
  
 1   When you make the **char** type unsigned by default (by specifying the /J compiler option), you cannot abbreviate **signed char** as **char**.  
  
 2   In 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems, the Microsoft C compiler maps **long double** to type **double**.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 You can specify the /J compiler option to change the default **char** type from signed to unsigned. When this option is in effect, **char** means the same as **unsigned char**, and you must use the **signed** keyword to declare a signed character value. If a **char** value is explicitly declared signed, the /J option does not affect it, and the value is sign-extended when widened to an **int** type. The **char** type is zero-extended when widened to **int** type.
