# Type int
The size of a signed or unsigned `int` item is the standard size of an integer on a particular machine. For example, in 16-bit operating systems, the `int` type is usually 16 bits, or 2 bytes. In 32-bit operating systems, the `int` type is usually 32 bits, or 4 bytes. Thus, the `int` type is equivalent to either the `short int` or the **long int** type, and the `unsigned int` type is equivalent to either the **unsigned short** or the `unsigned long` type, depending on the target environment. The `int` types all represent signed values unless specified otherwise.  
  
 The type specifiers `int` and `unsigned int` (or simply `unsigned`) define certain features of the C language (for instance, the `enum` type). In these cases, the definitions of `int` and unsigned int for a particular implementation determine the actual storage.  
  
 **Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Signed integers are represented in two's-complement form. The most-significant bit holds the sign: 1 for negative, 0 for positive and zero. The range of values is given in [C++ Integer Limits](../c-language/cpp-integer-limits.md), which is taken from the LIMITS.H header file.

> [!NOTE]
>  The int and unsigned int type specifiers are widely used in C programs because they allow a particular machine to handle integer values in the most efficient way for that machine. However, since the sizes of the int and unsigned int types vary, programs that depend on a specific int size may not be portable to other machines. To make programs more portable, you can use expressions with the sizeof operator (as discussed in [The sizeof Operator](../c-language/sizeof-operator-c.md)) instead of hard-coded data sizes.
