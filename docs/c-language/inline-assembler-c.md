# Inline Assembler (C)
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
 The inline assembler lets you embed assembly-language instructions directly in your C source programs without extra assembly and link steps. The inline assembler is built into the compiler â€” you don't need a separate assembler such as the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM).  
  
 Because the inline assembler doesn't require separate assembly and link steps, it is more convenient than a separate assembler. Inline assembly code can use any C variable or function name that is in scope, so it is easy to integrate it with your program's C code. And because the assembly code can be mixed with C statements, it can do tasks that are cumbersome or impossible in C alone.  
  
 The `__asm` keyword invokes the inline assembler and can appear wherever a C statement is legal. It cannot appear by itself. It must be followed by an assembly instruction, a group of instructions enclosed in braces, or, at the very least, an empty pair of braces. The term "`__asm` block" here refers to any instruction or group of instructions, whether or not in braces.  
  
 The code below is a simple `__asm` block enclosed in braces. (The code is a custom function prolog sequence.)  
  
```  
__asm  
{  
   push ebp  
   mov  ebp, esp  
   sub  esp, __LOCAL_SIZE  
}  
```  
  
 Alternatively, you can put `__asm` in front of each assembly instruction:  
  
```  
__asm push ebp  
__asm mov  ebp, esp  
__asm sub  esp, __LOCAL_SIZE  
```  
  
 Since the `__asm` keyword is a statement separator, you can also put assembly instructions on the same line:  
  
```  
__asm push ebp   __asm mov  ebp, esp   __asm sub  esp, __LOCAL_SIZE   
```
