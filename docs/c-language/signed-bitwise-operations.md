# Signed Bitwise Operations
**ANSI 3.3** The results of bitwise operations on signed integers  
  
 Bitwise operations on signed integers work the same as bitwise operations on unsigned integers. For example, `-16 & 99` can be expressed in binary as  
  
```  
  11111111 11110000  
& 00000000 01100011  
  _________________  
  00000000 01100000  
```  
  
 The result of the bitwise AND is 96.
