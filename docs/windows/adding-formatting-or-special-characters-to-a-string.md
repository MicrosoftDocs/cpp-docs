# Adding Formatting or Special Characters to a String
### To add formatting or special characters to a string  
  
1.  Open the string table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  Select the string you want to modify.  
  
3.  In the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), add any of the standard escape sequences listed below to the text in the **Caption** box, and press **Enter**.
