# Sizing a Control While You Add It

### To size a control while you add it

1. Select a control in the [Toolbox Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/toolbox).

2. Place your cursor (which appears as cross hairs) where you want the upper-left corner of the new control to be on your dialog box.

3. Click and hold down the mouse button to anchor the upper-left corner of your control on the dialog box, then drag the cursor to the right and down until the control is the size you want.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can actually anchor any of the four corners of the control you're drawing. This procedure used the upper-left corner as an example.

4. Release the mouse button. The control settles onto the dialog box in the size you specified.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can resize the control after dropping it onto the dialog box by moving the sizing handles on the border of the control. For more information, see [Sizing Individual Controls](../windows/sizing-individual-controls.md).
