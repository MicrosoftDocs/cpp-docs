# How to: Create a Resource Script File

> [!NOTE]
> The **Resource Editor** is not available in Express editions.
>
> This material applies to Windows desktop applications. Projects in .NET languages do not use resource script files. See [Resource Files](../windows/resource-files-visual-studio.md), for more information.

### To create a new resource script (.rc) file

1. Put focus on your existing project folder in **Solution Explorer**, for example, `MyProject`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't confuse the project folder with the Solution folder in **Solution Explorer**. If you put focus on the **Solution** folder, your choices in the **Add New Item** dialog box (in Step 3) will be different.

2. On the **Project** menu, click **Add New Item**.

3. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, click the **Visual C++** folder then choose **Resource File (.rc)** in the right pane.

4. Provide a name for your resource script file in the **Name** text box, then click **Open**.

You can now [create](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource.md) and add new resources to your .rc file.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only add a resource script (.rc file) to an existing project that is loaded into the Visual Studio IDE. You cannot create a standalone .rc file (one outside the project). [Resource templates](../windows/how-to-use-resource-templates.md) (.rct files) can be created anytime.

## Requirements
