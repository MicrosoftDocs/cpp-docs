# Adding Values to a Combo Box Control
You can add values to a combo box control as long as you have the **Dialog** editor open.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  It's a good idea to add all values to the combo box *before* you size the box in the **Dialog** editor, or you may truncate text that should appear in the combo control.  
  
### To enter values into a combo box control  
  
1.  Select the combo box control by clicking on it.  
  
2.  In the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), scroll down to the **Data** property.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you are displaying properties grouped by type, **Data** appears in the **Misc** properties.  
  
3.  Click in the value area for the **Data** property and type in your data values, separated by semicolons.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Do not put spaces between values because spaces interfere with alphabetizing in the drop-down list.  
  
4.  Click **Enter** when you are finished adding values.  
  
 For information on enlarging the drop-down portion of a combo box, see [Setting the Size of the Combo Box and Its Drop-Down List](setting-the-size-of-the-combo-box-and-its-drop-down-list.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot add values to Win32 projects using this procedure (the **Data** property is grayed out for Win32 projects). Because Win32 projects do not have libraries that add this capability, you must add values to a combo box with a Win32 project programmatically.  
  
### To test the appearance of values in a combo box  
  
1.  After entering values in the **Data** property, click the **Test** button on the [Dialog Editor Toolbar](../windows/showing-or-hiding-the-dialog-editor-toolbar.md).  
  
     Try scrolling down the entire value list. Values appear exactly as they are typed in the **Data** property in the **Properties** window. There is no spelling or capitalization checking.  
  
     Press **Esc** to return to the **Dialog box** editor.
