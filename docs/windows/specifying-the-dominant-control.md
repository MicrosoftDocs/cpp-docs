# Specifying the Dominant Control

The control selected first is the dominant control.

### To specify the dominant control

1. Hold down the **Ctrl** key and click the control you want to use to influence the size or location of other controls *first*.

   **Note** The sizing handles of the dominant control are solid while the handles of subordinate controls are hollow. All further resizing or alignment is based on the dominant control.

### To change the dominant control

1. Clear the current selection by clicking outside all the currently selected controls.

2. Repeat the previous procedure, selecting a different control first.
