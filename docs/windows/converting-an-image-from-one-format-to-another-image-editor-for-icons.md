# Converting an Image From One Format to Another (Image Editor for Icons)

You can open GIF or JPEG images in the **Image** editor and save them as bitmaps. Also, you can open a bitmap file and save it as a GIF or JPEG. Images you work with need not be part of a project for editing in the development environment (see [stand-alone image editing](../windows/editing-an-image-outside-of-a-project-image-editor-for-icons.md)).

### To convert an image from one format to another

1. Open the image in the **Image** editor.

2. From the **File** menu, choose **Save *filename* As**.

3. In the **Save File As** dialog box, in the **File name** box, type the file name and the extension that denotes the format you want.

4. Click **Save**.
