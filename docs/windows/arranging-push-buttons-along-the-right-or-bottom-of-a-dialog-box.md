# Arranging Push Buttons Along the Right or Bottom of a Dialog Box
### To arrange push buttons along the right or bottom of a dialog box  
  
1.  Select one or more push buttons.  
  
2.  From the **Format** menu, choose **Arrange Buttons**, and then choose one of the following arrangements:  
  
    -   **Right**: aligns push buttons along the right edge of the dialog box.  
  
    -   **Bottom**: aligns push buttons along the bottom edge of the dialog box.  
  
         If you select a control other than a push button, its position is not affected.
