# Adding Files to an Empty Win32 Applications
### To add your files to an empty Windows desktop application  
  
1.  Select the directory in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
2.  Right-click the directory name, click **Add** from the shortcut menu, and then click **Existing Item**.  
  
3.  In the **Add Existing Item dialog**, navigate to the files you want to add to your project.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
 To add files that are neither source, header, or resource files to your project, right-click the **Solution** node in **Solution Explorer** and add the files to the project in the same manner. A **Miscellaneous** folder will be created to hold the other files in your project.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Before building your project, you will need to specify build options for these files so that they are included correctly in your finished application. For more information, see [Specifying Project Settings with Property Pages](../ide/property-pages-visual-cpp.md) and [Building a C/C++ Program](../build/building-c-cpp-programs.md).
