# Guide Settings Dialog Box

## Layout guides

Displays the settings for the layout guides.

### None

Hides layout tools.

### Rulers and guides

When enabled, adds rulers to the layout tools; guides can be placed in the rulers. The default guides are the margins, which can be moved by dragging. Click in the rulers to place a guide. Controls "snap" to guides when the controls are moved over or next to them. Controls also move with a guide once they are attached to it. When a control is attached to a guide on each side, and a guide is moved, the control is resized.

### Grid

Creates a layout grid. New controls will automatically align to the grid.

## Grid spacing

Displays the settings for the grid spacing in dialog box units (DLUs).

### Width: DLUs

Sets the width of the layout grid in DLUs. A horizontal DLU is the average width of the dialog box font divided by four.

### Height: DLUs

Sets the height of the layout grid in DLUs. A vertical DLU is the average height of the dialog box font divided by eight.
