# WeakReference Class1
Supports the WRL infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from your code.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
class WeakReference;  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Represents a *weak reference* that can be used with the Windows Runtime or classic COM. A weak reference represents an object that might or might not be accessible.  
  
 A **WeakReference** object maintains a *strong reference*, which is a pointer to an object, and a *strong reference count*, which is the number of copies of the strong reference that have been distributed by the `Resolve()` method. While the strong reference count is nonzero, the strong reference is valid and the object is accessible. When the strong reference count becomes zero, the strong reference is invalid and the object is inaccessible.  
  
 A **WeakReference** object is typically used to represent an object whose existence is controlled by an external thread or application. For example, construct a **WeakReference** object from a reference to a file object. While the file is open, the strong reference is valid. But if the file is closed, the strong reference becomes invalid.  
  
 The **WeakReference** methods are thread safe.
