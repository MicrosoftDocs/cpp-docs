# Grid Settings Dialog Box (Image Editor for Icons)
Allows you to specify the grid settings for your image and displays grid lines over the edited image. The lines are useful for editing the image, but are not saved as part of the image itself.  
  
 **Pixel grid**  
 When checked, displays a grid around each pixel in the Image editor. The grid appears only at 4× and higher resolutions.  
  
 **Tile grid**  
 When selected, displays a grid around blocks of pixels in the Image editor, specified by the grid spacing values.  
  
 **Width**  
 Specifies the width of each tile block. This is useful when drawing bitmaps containing multiple images that are arranged at regular intervals.  
  
 **Height**  
 Specifies the height of each tile block. This is useful when drawing bitmaps containing multiple images that are arranged at regular intervals.
