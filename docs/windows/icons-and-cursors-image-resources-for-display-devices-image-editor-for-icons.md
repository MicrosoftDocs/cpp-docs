# Icons and Cursors: Image Resources for Display Devices (Image Editor for Icons)
Icons and cursors are graphical resources that can contain multiple images in different sizes and color schemes for different types of display devices. In addition, a cursor has a "hot spot," the location Windows uses to track its position. Both icons and cursors are created and edited using the **Image** editor, as are bitmaps and other images.  
  
 When you create a new icon or cursor, the **Image** editor first creates an image of a standard type. The image is initially filled with the screen (transparent) color. If the image is a cursor, the hot spot is initially the upper-left corner (coordinates 0,0).  
  
 By default, the **Image** editor supports the creation of additional images for the devices shown in the following table. You can create images for other devices by typing width, height, and color-count parameters into the [Custom Image dialog box](custom-image-dialog-box-image-editor-for-icons.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Using the **Image Editor**, you can view 32-bit images, but you cannot edit them.
