# Choosing a Transparent or Opaque Background (Image Editor for Icons)

When you move or copy a selection from an image, any pixels in the selection that match the current background color are, by default, transparent; they do not obscure pixels in the target location.

You can switch from a transparent background (the default) to an opaque background, and back again. When you use a selection tool, the **Transparent Background** and **Opaque Background** options appear in the **Option** selector on the **Image Editor** toolbar (as seen below).

**Transparent and Opaque Options** on the **Image Editor Toolbar**

### To switch between a transparent and opaque background

1. In the **Image Editor** toolbar, click the **Option** selector, and then click the appropriate background:

   - `Opaque Background (O)`: Existing image is obscured by all parts of the selection.

   - `Transparent Background (T)`: Existing image shows through parts of the selection that match the current background color.

\- or -

- On the **Image** menu, select or clear **Draw Opaque**.

You can change the background color while a selection is already in effect to change which parts of the image are transparent.
