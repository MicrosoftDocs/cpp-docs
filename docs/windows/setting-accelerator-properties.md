# Setting Accelerator Properties

You can set accelerator properties in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window) at any time. You can also use the **Accelerator** editor to modify the accelerator properties in the accelerator table. Changes made using the **Properties** window or the **Accelerator** editor have the same result: edits are immediately reflected in the accelerator table.

There are three properties for each accelerator ID:

- The [Modifier property](../windows/accelerator-modifier-property.md) sets control key combinations for the accelerator.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In the **Properties** window, this property appears as three separate Boolean properties, all of which can be controlled independently: **Alt**, **Ctrl**, and **Shift**.

- The [Key property](../windows/accelerator-key-property.md) sets the actual key to use as the accelerator.

- The [Type property](../windows/accelerator-type-property.md) determines whether the key is interpreted as virtual (VIRTKEY) or ASCII/ANSI.

## Requirements

Win32
