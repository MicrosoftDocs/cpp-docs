# Changing the Properties of a Resource
### To edit the properties of a resource  
  
1.  In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), right-click the resource you want to edit and choose **Properties** from the shortcut menu.  
  
     **Note** If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  In the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), change the properties of your resource.  
  
### To undo a change you've made to the properties of a resource  
  
1.  Make sure your resource has focus in Resource View.  
  
2.  Choose **Undo** from the **Edit** menu.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).
