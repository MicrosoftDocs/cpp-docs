# ID Property
The ID property references each accelerator table entry in program code. This is the command value that the program will receive when a user presses the accelerator key or a key combination. To make an accelerator the same as a menu item, make their IDs the same (so long as the ID of the accelerator table is the same as the ID for the menu resource).
