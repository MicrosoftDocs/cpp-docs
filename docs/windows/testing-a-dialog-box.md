# Testing a Dialog Box
When you're designing a dialog box, you can simulate and test its run-time behavior without compiling your program. In this mode, you can:  
  
-   Type text, select from combo-box lists, turn options on or off, and choose commands.  
  
-   Test the tab order.  
  
-   Test the grouping of controls such as radio buttons and check boxes.  
  
-   Test the keyboard shortcuts for controls in the dialog box.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Connections to dialog box code made by using wizards are not included in the simulation.  
  
 When you test a dialog box, it typically displays at a location that's relative to the main program window. If you've set the dialog box's **Absolute Align** property to **True**, the dialog box displays at a position that's relative to the upper-left corner of the screen.  
  
### To test a dialog box  
  
1.  When the **Dialog** editor is the active window, on the menu bar, choose **Format** > **Test Dialog**.  
  
2.  To end the simulation, press **Esc**, or just choose the **Close** button in the dialog box you are testing.
