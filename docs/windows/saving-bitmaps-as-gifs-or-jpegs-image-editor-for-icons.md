# Saving Bitmaps as GIFs or JPEGs (Image Editor for Icons)
When you create a bitmap, the image is created in bitmap format (.bmp). You can, however, save the image as a GIF or JPEG or in other graphic formats.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This process does not apply to icons and cursors.  
  
### To create and save a bitmap as a .gif or .jpeg  
  
1.  From the **File** menu, choose **Open**, then click **File**.  
  
2.  In the **New File dialog box**, click the **Visual C++** folder, then select **Bitmap File (.bmp)** in the **Templates** box and click **Open**.  
  
     The bitmap opens in the **Image** editor.  
  
3.  Make changes to your new bitmap as needed.  
  
4.  With the bitmap still open in the **Image** editor, click **Save *filename*.bmp As** on the **File** menu.  
  
5.  In the **Save File As** dialog box, type the name you want to give the file and the extension that denotes the file format you want in the **File Name** box. For example, *myfile.gif*.  
  
     > [!NOTE]
     > You must create or open the bitmap outside of your project in order to save it as another file format. If you create or open it within your project, the **Save As** command will be unavailable. For more information, see [Viewing Resources in a Resource Script File Outside of a Project (Standalone)](../windows/how-to-open-a-resource-script-file-outside-of-a-project-standalone.md).  
  
6.  Click **Save**.
