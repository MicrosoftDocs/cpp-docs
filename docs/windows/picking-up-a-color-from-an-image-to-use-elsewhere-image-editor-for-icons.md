# Picking up a Color from an Image to Use Elsewhere (Image Editor for Icons)
The **Select Color**, or color-pickup, tool makes any color on the image the current foreground color or background color, depending on whether you press the left or the right mouse button. To cancel the **Select Color** tool, choose another tool.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Tool tips appear when you hover your cursor over a toolbar button. These tips can help you identify the function of each button.  
  
### To pick up a color  
  
1.  On the **Image Editor** toolbar (or from the **Image** menu, **Tools** command), click the **Select Color** tool.  
  
2.  Select the color you want to pick up from the image.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  After you pick up a color, the Image editor reactivates the most recently used tool.  
  
3.  Draw using the left mouse button for the foreground color, or the right mouse button for the background color.
