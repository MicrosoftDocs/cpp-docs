# Override Specifiers  (C++ Component Extensions)

*Override specifiers* modify how inherited types and members of inherited types behave in derived types.

## All Runtimes

### Remarks

For more information about override specifiers, see:

- [abstract](../windows/abstract-cpp-component-extensions.md)

- [new (new slot in vtable)](../windows/new-new-slot-in-vtable-cpp-component-extensions.md)

- [override](../windows/override-cpp-component-extensions.md)

- [sealed](../windows/sealed-cpp-component-extensions.md)

- [Override Specifiers and Native Compilations](../dotnet/how-to-declare-override-specifiers-in-native-compilations-cpp-cli.md)

**abstract** and **sealed** are also valid on type declarations, where they do not act as override specifiers.

For information about explicitly overriding base class functions, see [Explicit Overrides](../windows/explicit-overrides-cpp-component-extensions.md).

## Windows Runtime

(There are no remarks for this language feature that apply to only the Windows Runtime.)

### Requirements

Compiler option: `/ZW`

## Common Language Runtime

(There are no remarks for this language feature that apply to only the common language runtime.)

### Requirements
