# Accelerator Editor
An accelerator table is a Windows resource that contains a list of accelerator keys (also known as shortcut keys) and the command identifiers that are associated with them. A program can have more than one accelerator table.  
  
 Normally, accelerators are used as keyboard shortcuts for program commands that are also available on a menu or toolbar. However, you can use the accelerator table to define key combinations for commands that don't have a user-interface object associated with them.  
  
 You can use [Class View](http://msdn.microsoft.com/8d7430a9-3e33-454c-a9e1-a85e3d2db925) to hook accelerator key commands to code.  
  
 With the **Accelerator** editor, you can:  
  
-   [Set Accelerator Properties](../windows/setting-accelerator-properties.md)  
  
-   [Associate an Accelerator Key with a Menu Item](../windows/associating-an-accelerator-key-with-a-menu-item.md)  
  
-   [Edit Accelerator Tables](../windows/editing-accelerator-tables.md)  
  
-   [Use Predefined Accelerator Keys](../windows/predefined-accelerator-keys.md)  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  While using the **Accelerator** editor, you can right-click to display a shortcut menu of frequently used commands. The commands available depend on what the pointer is pointing to.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Windows does not allow you to create empty accelerator tables. If you create an accelerator table with no entries, it is deleted automatically when you save the table.
