# Accelerator Editor (C++)

An accelerator table is a C++ Windows resource that contains a list of accelerator keys (also known as shortcut keys) and the command identifiers that are associated with them. A program can have more than one accelerator table.

Normally, accelerators are used as keyboard shortcuts for program commands that are also available on a menu or toolbar. However, you can use the accelerator table to define key combinations for commands that don't have a user-interface object associated with them.

You can use [Class View](/visualstudio/ide/viewing-the-structure-of-code) to hook accelerator key commands to code.

With the **Accelerator** editor, you can:

- [Set Accelerator Properties](../windows/setting-accelerator-properties.md)

- [Associate an Accelerator Key with a Menu Item](../windows/associating-an-accelerator-key-with-a-menu-item.md)

- [Edit Accelerator Tables](../windows/editing-accelerator-tables.md)

- [Use Predefined Accelerator Keys](../windows/predefined-accelerator-keys.md)

   > [!TIP]
   > While using the **Accelerator** editor, you can right-click to display a shortcut menu of frequently used commands. The commands available depend on what the pointer is pointing to.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Windows does not allow you to create empty accelerator tables. If you create an accelerator table with no entries, it is deleted automatically when you save the table.
