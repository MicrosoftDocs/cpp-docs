# Displaying or Hiding the Pixel Grid (Image Editor for Icons)
For all **Image Editor** panes with a magnification factor of 4 or greater, you can display a grid that delimits the individual pixels in the image.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Tool tips appear when you hover your cursor over a toolbar button. These tips can help you identify the function of each button.  
  
### To display or hide the pixel grid  
  
1.  On the **Image** menu, click **Grid Settings**.  
  
2.  Select the **Pixel Grid** check box to display the grid, or clear the box to hide the grid.
