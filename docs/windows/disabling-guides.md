# Disabling Guides
You can use special keys in conjunction with the mouse to disable the snapping effect of the guides. Using the **Alt** key disables the snapping effects of the guide selected. Moving a guide with the **Shift** key prevents snapped controls from moving with the guide.  
  
### To disable the snapping effect of the guides  
  
1.  Drag the control while holding down the **Alt** key.  
  
### To move guides without moving the snapped controls  
  
1.  Drag the guide while holding down the **Shift** key.  
  
### To turn off the guides  
  
1.  From the **Format** menu, choose **Guide Settings**.  
  
2.  In the [Guide Settings Dialog Box](../windows/guide-settings-dialog-box.md), under **Layout Guides**, select **None**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can also double-click the ruler bar to access the **Guide Settings** dialog box.
