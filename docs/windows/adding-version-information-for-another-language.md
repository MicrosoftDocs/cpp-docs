# Adding Version Information for Another Language

### To add version information for another language (new info block)

1. Open a version information resource by double-clicking it in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).

2. Right-click within the version information table and choose **New Version Info Block** from the shortcut menu.

   This command adds an additional information block to the current version information resource and opens its corresponding properties in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).

3. In the **Properties** window, choose the appropriate language and character set for your new block.

For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
