# Opening the Resource Editor for a Given Symbol
When you are browsing symbols in the [Resource Symbols dialog box](../windows/resource-symbols-dialog-box.md), you may want more information on how a particular symbol is used. The **View Use** button provides a quick way to get this information.  
  
### To move to the resource editor where a symbol is being used  
  
1.  Select a symbol in the **Name** box of the **Resource Symbols** dialog box.  
  
2.  In the **Used By** box, select the resource type that interests you.  
  
3.  Click the **View Use** button.  
  
     The resource appears in the appropriate editor window.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.*
