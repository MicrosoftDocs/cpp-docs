# Controls in Dialog Boxes
You can add controls to a dialog box using the [Dialog Editor tab](../windows/dialog-editor-tab-toolbox.md) in the [Toolbox window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/toolbox), which enables you to choose the control you want and drag it onto the dialog box. By default, the Toolbox window is set to auto hide. It appears as a tab on the left margin of your solution when the Dialog editor is open. However, you can pin the Toolbox window into position by clicking the **Auto Hide** button in the upper right corner of the window. For more information on how to control the behavior of this window, see [Window Management](/visualstudio/ide/customizing-window-layouts-in-visual-studio).  
  
 The fastest way to add controls to a dialog box, reposition existing controls, or move controls from one dialog box to another, is to use the drag-and-drop method. The control's position is outlined in a dotted line until it is dropped into the dialog box. When you add a control to a dialog box with the drag-and-drop method, the control is given a standard height appropriate to that type of control.  
  
 When you add a control to a dialog box or reposition it, its final placement may be determined by guides or margins, or whether you have the layout grid turned on.  
  
 Once you have added a control to the dialog box, you can change properties such as its caption in the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window). You can select multiple controls and change their properties all at once.
