# Adding a Control to a Dialog Box

### To add a control to a dialog box

1. Ensure that the dialog box tabbed window is the current document in the editor frame. If a dialog is not the current document, you won't see the **Dialog Editor Tab** in the **Toolbox**.

2. On the [Dialog Editor Tab](../windows/dialog-editor-tab-toolbox.md) of the [Toolbox Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/toolbox), select the control you want, then:

   - Click the dialog box at the location where you want to place the control. The control appears where you've clicked. For information, see [Adding Multiple Controls](../windows/adding-multiple-controls.md).

       \- or -

   - Drag and drop the control from the **Toolbox** window to the location on your dialog box. For more information, see [Sizing a Control While You Add It](../windows/sizing-a-control-while-you-add-it.md).

       \- or -

   - Double-click the control in the **Toolbox** window (it appears on your dialog box) then reposition the control to the location you prefer.

For information about the types of controls available on the **Toolbox** window, see [Dialog Editor Tab, Toolbox Window](../windows/dialog-editor-tab-toolbox.md).

For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
