# Load Palette Colors C++ Dialog Box (Image Editor for Icons)

Use this dialog box to load special color palettes to use in your C++ project. For more information, see [Saving and Loading Different Color Palettes](../windows/saving-and-loading-different-color-palettes-image-editor-for-icons.md).

### Look in

Specifies the location where you want to locate a file or folder. Click the arrow to select another location, or click the folder icon on the toolbar to move up levels.

### File name

Provides a space for you to type the name of the file you want to open. To quickly find a file you've previously opened, click the file name in the drop-down list, if available.

If you are searching for a file, you can use asterisks (*) as wildcards. For example, you can type \*.\* to see a list of all files. You can also type the full path of a file, for example, C:\My Documents\MyColorPalette.pal or \\\NetworkServer\MyFolder\MyColorPalette.pal.

### Files of type
