# Changing the Names of Symbol Header Files
Normally all symbol definitions are saved in Resource.h. However, you may need to change this include filename so that you can, for example, work with more than one resource file in the same directory.  
  
### To change the name of the resource symbol header file  
  
1.  In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), right-click your .rc file and choose [Resource Includes](../windows/resource-includes-dialog-box.md) from the shortcut menu.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  In the **Symbol header file** box, type the new name for the include file.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.*
