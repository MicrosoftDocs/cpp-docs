# Arrays (C++ Component Extensions)
The `Platform::Array<T>` type in C++/CX, or the **array** keyword in C++/CLI, declares an array of a specified type and initial value.  
  
## All Platforms  
 The array must be declared by using the handle-to-object (^) modifier after the closing angle bracket (>) in the declaration.  
 The number of elements of the array is not part of the type. One array variable can refer to arrays of different sizes.  
  
 Unlike standard C++, subscripting is not a synonym for pointer arithmetic and is not commutative.  
  
 For more information about arrays, see:  
  
-   [How to: Use Arrays in C++/CLI](../dotnet/how-to-use-arrays-in-cpp-cli.md)  
    
-   [Variable Argument Lists (...) (C++/CLI)](../windows/variable-argument-lists-dot-dot-dot-cpp-cli.md)  
  
## Windows Runtime  
 Arrays are members of the `Platform` namespace. Arrays can be only one-dimensional.  
  
### Syntax  
  
 The first example of the syntax uses the **ref new** aggregate keyword to allocate an array. The second example declares a local array.  
  
```cpp  
[qualifiers] [Platform::]Array<[qualifiers] array-type [,rank]>^ identifier = 
    ref new[Platform::]Array<initialization-type> [{initialization-list [,...]}]  
  
[qualifiers] [Platform::]Array<[qualifiers] array-type [,rank]>^ identifier = 
    {initialization-list [,...]}  
```  
  
 *qualifiers* [optional]  
 One or more of these storage class specifiers: [mutable](../cpp/mutable-data-members-cpp.md), [volatile](../cpp/volatile-cpp.md), [const](../cpp/const-cpp.md), [extern](../cpp/using-extern-to-specify-linkage.md), [static](../cpp/static-members-cpp.md).  
  
 *array-type*  
 The type of the array variable. Valid types are Windows Runtime classes and fundamental types, ref classes and structs, value classes and structs, and native pointers (`type*`).  
  
 *rank* [optional]  
 The number of dimensions of the array. Must be 1.  
  
 *identifier*  
 The name of the array variable.  
  
 *initialization-type*  
 The type of the values that initialize the array. Typically, *array-type* and *initialization-type* are the same type. However, the types can be different if there is a conversion from *initialization-type* to *array-type*—for example, if *initialization-type* is derived from *array-type*.  
  
 *initialization-list* [optional]  
 A comma-delimited list of values in curly brackets that initialize the elements of the array. For example, if *rank-size-list* were `(3)`, which declares a one-dimensional array of 3 elements, *initialization list* could be `{1,2,3}`.  
  
### Remarks  
  
 You can detect at compile time whether a type is a reference-counted array with `__is_ref_array(type)`. For more information, see [Compiler Support for Type Traits](../windows/compiler-support-for-type-traits-cpp-component-extensions.md).  
  
### Requirements  
 Compiler option: `/ZW`  
  
### Examples  
 The following example creates a one-dimensional array that has 100 elements.  
  
```cpp  
// cwr_array.cpp  
// compile with: /ZW  
using namespace Platform;  
ref class MyClass {};  
int main() {  
   // one-dimensional array  
   Array<MyClass^>^ My1DArray = ref new Array<MyClass^>(100);  
   My1DArray[99] = ref new MyClass();  
}  
```  
  
## Common Language Runtime 
  
### Syntax  
  
 The first example of the syntax uses the **gcnew** keyword to allocate an array. The second example declares a local array.  
  
```cpp  
[qualifiers] [cli::]array<[qualifiers] array-type [,rank]>^ identifier = 
    gcnew [cli::]array<initialization-type[,rank]>(rank-size-list[,...]) [{initialization-list [,...]}]  
  
[qualifiers] [cli::]array<[qualifiers] array-type [,rank]>^ identifier = 
    {initialization-list [,...]}  
```  
  
 *qualifiers* [optional]  
 One or more of these storage class specifiers: [mutable](../cpp/mutable-data-members-cpp.md), [volatile](../cpp/volatile-cpp.md), [const](../cpp/const-cpp.md), [extern](../cpp/using-extern-to-specify-linkage.md), [static](../cpp/static-members-cpp.md).  
  
 *array-type*  
 The type of the array variable. Valid types are Windows Runtime classes and fundamental types, ref classes and structs, value classes and structs, native pointers (`type*`), and native POD (plain old data) types.  
  
 *rank* [optional]  
 The number of dimensions of the array. The default is 1; the maximum is 32. Each dimension of the array is itself an array.  
  
 *identifier*  
 The name of the array variable.  
  
 *initialization-type*  
 The type of the values that initialize the array. Typically, *array-type* and *initialization-type* are the same type. However, the types can be different if there is a conversion from *initialization-type* to *array-type*—for example, if *initialization-type* is derived from *array-type*.  
  
 *rank-size-list*  
 A comma-delimited list of the size of each dimension in the array. Alternatively, if the *initialization-list* parameter is specified, the compiler can deduce the size of each dimension and *rank-size-list* can be omitted. 
  
 *initialization-list* [optional]  
 A comma-delimited list of values in curly brackets that initialize the elements of the array. Or a comma-delimited list of nested *initialization-list* items that initialize the elements in a multi-dimensional array.  
  
 For example, if *rank-size-list* were `(3)`, which declares a one-dimensional array of 3 elements, *initialization list* could be `{1,2,3}`. If *rank-size-list* were `(3,2,4)`, which declares a three-dimensional array of 3 elements in the first dimension, 2 elements in the second, and 4 elements in the third, *initialization-list* could be `{{1,2,3},{0,0},{-5,10,-21,99}}`.)  
  
### Remarks  
  
 **array** is in the [Platform, default, and cli Namespaces](../windows/platform-default-and-cli-namespaces-cpp-component-extensions.md) namespace.  
  
 Like standard C++, the indices of an array are zero-based, and an array is subscripted by using square brackets ([]). Unlike standard C++, the indices of a multi-dimensional array are specified in a list of indices for each dimension instead of a set of square-bracket ([]) operators for each dimension. For example, *identifier*[*index1*, *index2*] instead of *identifier*[*index1*][ *index2*].  
  
 All managed arrays inherit from `System::Array`. Any method or property of `System::Array` can be applied directly to the array variable.  
  
 When you allocate an array whose element type is pointer-to a managed class, the elements are 0-initialized.  
  
 When you allocate an array whose element type is a value type `V`, the default constructor for `V` is applied to each array element. For more information, see [.NET Framework Equivalents to C++ Native Types (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/dotnet-framework-equivalents-to-cpp-native-types-cpp-cli.md).  
  
 At compile time, you can detect whether a type is a common language runtime (CLR) array with `__is_ref_array(type)`. For more information, see [Compiler Support for Type Traits](../windows/compiler-support-for-type-traits-cpp-component-extensions.md).  
  
### Requirements  
 Compiler option: `/clr`  
  
### Examples  
 The following example creates a one-dimensional array that has 100 elements, and a three-dimensional array that has 3 elements in the first dimension, 5 elements in the second, and 6 elements in the third.  
  
```cpp  
// clr_array.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
ref class MyClass {};  
int main() {  
   // one-dimensional array  
   array<MyClass ^> ^ My1DArray = gcnew array<MyClass ^>(100);  
   My1DArray[99] = gcnew MyClass();  
  
   // three-dimensional array  
   array<MyClass ^, 3> ^ My3DArray = gcnew array<MyClass ^, 3>(3, 5, 6);  
   My3DArray[0,0,0] = gcnew MyClass();  
}  
```
