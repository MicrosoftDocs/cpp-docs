# Editing a String in a Version Information Resource
### To edit a string in a version information resource  
  
1.  Click the item once to select it, then again to begin editing it. Make the changes directly in the **Version Information** table or in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window). The changes you make will be reflected in both places.  
  
     > [!NOTE] 
     > When editing the `FILEFLAGS` key in the **Version Information** editor, you'll notice you cannot set the **Debug**, **Private Build**, or **Special Build** properties (in the **Properties** window) for .rc files:  
  
    -   The **Version Information** editor sets the **Debug** property with a `#ifdef` in the resource script, based on the `_DEBUG` build flag.  
  
    -   If the `Private Build` key has a **Value** set in the **Version Information** table, the corresponding **Private Build** property (in the **Properties** window) for the `FILEFLAGS` key will be **True**. If the **Value** is empty, the property will be **False**. Likewise, the **Special Build** key (in the **Version Information** table) is tied to the **Special Build** property for the `FILEFLAGS` key.  
  
 You can sort the information sequence of the string block by clicking either the Key or the Value column headings. These headings automatically rearrange the information into the selected sequence.
