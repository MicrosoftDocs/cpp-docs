# FtmBase::MarshalInterface Method

Writes into a stream the data required to initialize a proxy object in some client process.

## Syntax

```cpp
STDMETHODIMP MarshalInterface(
   __in IStream *pStm,
   __in REFIID riid,
   __in_opt void *pv,
   __in DWORD dwDestContext,
   __reserved void *pvDestContext,
   __in DWORD mshlflags
) override;
```

### Parameters

*pStm*  
Pointer to the stream to be used during marshaling.

*riid*  
Reference to the identifier of the interface to be marshaled. This interface must be derived from the `IUnknown` interface.

*pv*  
Pointer to the interface pointer to be marshaled; can be NULL if the caller does not have a pointer to the desired interface.

*dwDestContext*  
Destination context where the specified interface is to be unmarshaled.

Specify one or more MSHCTX enumeration values.

Unmarshaling can occur in another apartment of the current process (MSHCTX_INPROC) or in another process on the same computer as the current process (MSHCTX_LOCAL).

*pvDestContext*  
Reserved for future use; must be zero.

*mshlflags*  
Specifies whether the data to be marshaled is to be transmitted back to the client process — the typical case — or written to a global table, where it can be retrieved by multiple clients.

## Return Value

S_OK
 The interface pointer was marshaled successfully.

E_NOINTERFACE
 The specified interface is not supported.

STG_E_MEDIUMFULL
 The stream is full.

E_FAIL
 The operation failed.

## Requirements

**Header:** ftm.h

**Namespace:** Microsoft::WRL
