# Arrangement of Controls on Dialog Boxes
The Dialog editor provides layout tools that align and size controls automatically. For most tasks, you can use the [Dialog Editor Toolbar](../windows/showing-or-hiding-the-dialog-editor-toolbar.md). All Dialog Editor toolbar commands are also available on the Format menu, and most have [shortcut keys](../windows/accelerator-keys-for-the-dialog-editor.md).  
  
 Many layout commands for dialog boxes are available only when more than one control is selected. You can select a single control or multiple controls, and when more than one control is selected, the first one you select is by default the "dominant" control. For information on selecting controls and the dominant control, see [Selecting Controls](../windows/selecting-controls.md).  
  
 The location, height, and width of the current control are displayed in the lower-right corner of the status bar. When the entire dialog box is selected, the status bar displays the position of the dialog box as a whole, and its height and width.
