# Resources for Creating a Game Using DirectX

To create the best desktop games, use Visual C++ and DirectX together.

## Resources

Visual C++ is included in all editions of Visual Studio, but it's not installed by default. For information about how to install Visual Studio and the C++ development tools, see [Install C++ support in Visual Studio](../build/vscpp-step-0-installation.md).

For Windows 8.1 and later, the DirectX SDK is included in the Windows SDK. You don't have to download anything extra. For more information, see [Where is the DirectX SDK?](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee663275.aspx).

To create DirectX apps for Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP, you can download the stand-alone [DirectX SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=6812).

[DirectX Graphics and Gaming](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee663274\(v=vs.85\).aspx) has information and samples to help you get started with DirectX programming.

[Win32 Windows Applications](../windows/windows-desktop-applications-cpp.md) contains articles that describe how to create a basic Windows desktop app.

[Developing Games](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh452744.aspx) discusses Universal Windows Platform game development, but many of the concepts also apply to desktop games.
