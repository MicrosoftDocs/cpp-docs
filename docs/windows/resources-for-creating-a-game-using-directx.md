# Resources for Creating a C++ Game Using DirectX

To create the best desktop games, use Visual C++ and DirectX together.

## Resources

Visual C++ is included in all editions of Visual Studio, but it's not installed by default. For information about how to install Visual Studio and the C++ development tools, see [Install C++ support in Visual Studio](../build/vscpp-step-0-installation.md).

For Windows 8.1 and later, the DirectX SDK is included in the Windows SDK. You don't have to download anything extra. For more information, see [Where is the DirectX SDK?](/windows/win32/directx-sdk--august-2009-).

To create DirectX apps for Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP, you can download the stand-alone [DirectX SDK](https://web.archive.org/web/20161026183606/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=6812) (Archive link).

[DirectX Graphics and Gaming](/windows/win32/directx) has information and samples to help you get started with DirectX programming.\
[Developing Games](/windows/uwp/gaming/getting-started) discusses Universal Windows Platform game development, but many of the concepts also apply to desktop games.
