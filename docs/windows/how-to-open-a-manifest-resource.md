# How to: Open a Manifest Resource
If you open a manifest resource from [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), the resource will open in binary format. To view the contents of a manifest resource in a more viewable format, you must open the resource from Solution Explorer.  
  
### To open a manifest resource in the Text Editor  
  
1.  With your project open in `Solution Explorer`, expand the **Resource Files** folder.  
  
2.  Double-click the .manifest file.  
  
     Your manifest resource opens in the Text Editor.  
  
### To open a manifest resource in another editor  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the .manifest file and choose **Open With...** from the shortcut menu.  
  
2.  In the **Open With** dialog box, specify the editor you would like to use and click **Open**.
