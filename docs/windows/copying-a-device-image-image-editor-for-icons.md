# Copying a Device Image (Image Editor for Icons)

### To copy a device image

1. On the **Image** menu, click **Open Device Image** and select an image from the current images list. For example, choose the 32 × 32, 16-color version of an icon.

2. Copy the currently displayed icon image (**Ctrl**+**C**).

3. Open a different image of the icon in another **Image Editor** window. For example, open the 16 × 16, 16-color version of the icon.

4. Paste the icon image (**Ctrl**+**V**) from one **Image Editor** window to the other. If you are pasting a larger size into a smaller size, you can use the icon handles to resize the image.
