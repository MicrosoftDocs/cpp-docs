# Accessing Version Information from Within Your Program
### To access version information from within your program  
  
1.  If you want to access the version information from within your program, use the [GetFileVersionInfo](/windows/desktop/api/winver/nf-winver-getfileversioninfoa) function and the [VerQueryValue](/windows/desktop/api/winver/nf-winver-verqueryvaluea) function.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
