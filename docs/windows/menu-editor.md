# Menu Editor

Menus allow you to arrange commands in a logical and easy-to-find fashion. With the **Menu** editor, you can create and edit menus by working directly with a menu bar that closely resembles the one in your finished application.

For Visual C++ projects, you can use the **Menu** editor to:

- [Create Menus](../windows/creating-a-menu.md)

- [Insert a New Menu Between Existing Menus](../windows/inserting-a-new-menu-between-existing-menus.md)

- [Create a Menu Command](../windows/adding-commands-to-a-menu.md)

- [Create a Submenu Menu](../windows/creating-a-submenu.md)

- [Select Menus and Menu Commands](../windows/selecting-multiple-menus-or-menu-commands.md)

- [Move and Copy Menus and Menu Commands](../windows/moving-and-copying-menus-and-menu-commands.md)

- [Create Pop-up Menus](../windows/creating-pop-up-menus.md)

- [Connect a Pop-Up Menu to Your Application](../windows/connecting-a-pop-up-menu-to-your-application.md)

- [View a Menu Resource as a Pop-up Menu](../windows/viewing-a-menu-as-a-pop-up-menu.md)

- [Associate a Menu Command with an Accelerator Key](../windows/associating-a-menu-command-with-an-accelerator-key.md)

- [Associate a Menu Command with Status Bar Text](../windows/associating-menu-commands-with-status-bar-text-in-mfc-applications.md)

- [Assigning Access Keys to Menu Commands](../windows/assigning-access-keys-to-menu-commands.md)

- [Change Menu Command Properties](../windows/menu-command-properties.md)

   > [!TIP]
   > While using the **Menu** editor, in many instances, you can click the right mouse button to display a pop-up menu of frequently used commands. The commands available depend on what the pointer is pointing to.

   > [!NOTE]
   > For Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) programs and ATL programs, you can use **Code Wizards** to hook menu commands to code. For more information, see [Adding an Event](../ide/adding-an-event-visual-cpp.md).

For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
