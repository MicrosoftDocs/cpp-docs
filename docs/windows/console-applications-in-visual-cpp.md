# Console Applications in Visual C++
A console application accepts input and sends output to the console, which is also known as the command prompt. You can create console apps to do basic work or to perform very sophisticated tasks. You can also use a console app as a proof-of-concept demonstration of functionality that you later want to incorporate into a Windows desktop application or Universal Windows Platform App. Console apps can communicate with other desktop apps by means of pipes or other RPC mechanisms.
