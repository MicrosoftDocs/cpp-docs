# Editing Properties for an ActiveX Control

ActiveX controls supplied by independent vendors may come equipped with their own properties and characteristics. Properties for ActiveX controls are displayed in the **Properties** window. In addition, any property pages created by the writers of the ActiveX control are displayed in the **Properties Pages** dialog box (to view the **Property Page** for a specific ActiveX control, click the **Property Page** button in the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window)).

Various tabs are displayed in the property page for an ActiveX control, depending on the property sheets that come as part of the ActiveX control.

> [!NOTE]
> The following procedure applies to using the property page to edit ActiveX controls. You can also browse and edit ActiveX properties in the new **Properties** window.

### To edit properties for an ActiveX control

1. Select the **ActiveX** control.

2. On the **View** menu, click **Property Page** and view the properties.

3. Make changes as needed in the property page.
