# Editing Accelerator Tables

In Visual C++, you can edit an accelerator table directly with in-place editing in the **Accelerator** editor.

The procedures below refer to the use of standard property pages, however, both in-place editing and the property page method have the same result. Changes made using property pages or using in-place editing are immediately reflected in the accelerator table.

- [Editing an accelerator table](../windows/editing-in-an-accelerator-table.md)

- [Finding an entry in an accelerator table](../windows/finding-an-entry-in-an-accelerator-table.md)

- [Adding an entry to an accelerator table](../windows/adding-an-entry-to-an-accelerator-table.md)

- [Deleting an entry from an accelerator table](../windows/deleting-an-entry-from-an-accelerator-table.md)

- [Moving or copying an accelerator table entry](../windows/moving-or-copying-an-accelerator-table-entry-to-another-resource-script-file.md)

- [Changing the properties of multiple accelerator keys](../windows/changing-the-properties-of-multiple-accelerator-keys.md)

For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
