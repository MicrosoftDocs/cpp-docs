# Inserting a Space Between Buttons on a Toolbar

In general, to insert a space between buttons, simply drag them away from one another on the toolbar. To remove space, drag them towards each other.

### To insert a space before a button that is not followed by a space

1. Drag the button to the right or down until it overlaps the next button about halfway.

### To insert a space before a button which is followed by a space and to retain that trailing space

1. Drag the button until the right or bottom edge is just touching the next button or just overlaps it.

### To insert a space before a button that is followed by a space and close up that following space

1. Drag the button to the right or down until it overlaps the next button about halfway.
