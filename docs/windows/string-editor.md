# String Editor (C++)

A string table is a Windows resource that contains a list of IDs, values, and captions for all the strings of your application. For example, the status-bar prompts are located in the string table.

While developing an application, you can have several string tables â€” one for each language or condition. However, an executable module has only one string table. A running application can reference several string tables if you put the tables into different DLLs.

String tables make it easy to localize your application into different languages. If all strings are in a string table, you can localize the application by translating the strings (and other resources) without changing source code. This situation is more desirable than manually finding and replacing various strings in source files.

For information on adding resources to managed projects (projects that target the common language runtime), see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/y99d1cd3).

Use the **String** editor for the following actions:

## To find a string resource in the string table

You can search for one or more strings in the string table, and use [regular expressions](/visualstudio/ide/using-regular-expressions-in-visual-studio) with the **Find in Files** command (**Edit** menu) to locate all instances of strings that match a pattern.

1. Open the string table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).

1. On the **Edit** menu, select **Find and Replace**, then choose **Find**.

1. In the **Find What** box, select a previous search string from the drop-down list or type the caption text or resource identifier of the string you want to find.

1. Select any of the **Find** options.

1. Select **Find Next**.

   > [!TIP]
   > To use regular expressions when searching files, use the **Find in Files** command. Type a regular expression to match a pattern or select the button to the right of the **Find What** box to display a list of regular search expressions. When you select an expression from this list, it is substituted as the search text in the **Find What** box. If you use regular expressions, be sure the **Use: Regular Expressions** check box is selected.

## To add or delete a string resource

You can quickly insert or delete entries into the string table using the **String** editor. New strings are placed at the end of the table and are given the next available identifier. You can then edit the **ID**, **Value**, or **Caption** properties in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window) as needed.

The **String** editor makes sure you don't use an ID that's already in use. If you select an ID already in use, the **String** editor will notify you and then assign a generic unique ID, for example `IDS_STRING58113`.

### To add a string table entry

1. Open the string table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).

1. Right-click within the string table and choose **New String** from the shortcut menu.

1. In the **String** editor, select an **ID** from the ID drop-down list or type an ID directly in place.

1. Edit the **Value**, if necessary.

1. Type an entry for the **Caption**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Null strings are not allowed in Windows string tables. If you create an entry in the string table that is a null string, you will receive a message asking you to "Please enter a string for this table entry."

### To delete a string table entry

1. Select the entry you want to delete.

1. On the **Edit** menu, select **Delete**.

\- or -

 Right-click the string you want to delete and choose **Delete** from the shortcut menu.

\- or -

 Press the **Delete** key.

## To move a string from one resource script file to another

1. Open the string tables in both .rc files. (For more information, see [Viewing Resources in a Resource Script File Outside of a Project](../windows/how-to-open-a-resource-script-file-outside-of-a-project-standalone.md).)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).

1. Right-click the string you want to move and choose **Cut** from the shortcut menu.

1. Place the cursor in the target **String Editor** window.

1. In the .rc file to which you want to move the string, right-click and choose **Paste** from the shortcut menu.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the **ID** or **value** of the moved string conflicts with an existing **ID** or **value** in the destination file, either the **ID** or the **value** of the moved string changes. If a string exists with the same **ID**, the **ID** of the moved string changes. If a string exists with the same **value**, the **value** of the moved string changes.

## To change the properties of a string resource

You can use in-place editing to change the ID, value, and caption properties.

### To change a string or its identifier

1. Open the string table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).

2. Select the string you want to edit, and double-click the **ID**, **Value**, or **Caption** column. Now you can:

   - Select an **ID** from the **ID drop-down** list, or type an `ID` directly in place.

   - Type a different number in the **Value** column.

   - Type edits in the **Caption** column.

        > [!NOTE]
        >  You can also edit a string's properties in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).

### To change the caption property of multiple string resources

1. Open the string table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).

1. Select the strings you want to change by holding down the **Ctrl** key as you select each one.

1. In the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), type a new value for the property you want to change.

1. Press **Enter**.

## To add formatting or special characters to a string resource

1. Open the string table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).

1. Select the string you want to modify.

1. In the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), add any of the standard escape sequences listed below to the text in the **Caption** box, and press **Enter**.

   |To get this|Type this|
   |-----------------|---------------|
   | New line | \\n |
   | Carriage return | \\r |
   | Tab | \\t |
   | Backslash (\\) | \\\\ |
   | ASCII character | \\ddd (octal notation) |
   | Alert (bell) | \\a |

> [!NOTE]
> The **String** editor does not support the full set of escaped ASCI characters. You can only use those listed above.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows does not allow the creation of empty string tables. If you create a string table with no entries, it is deleted automatically when you save the resource file.
