# How to: Change the Language or Condition of a Resource While Copying (C++)

While copying in a resource, you can change its language property or condition property, or both.

- The language of the resource identifies just that, the language for the resource. This is used by [FindResource](/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-findresourcea) to help identify the resource for which you're looking. (However, resources can have differences for each language that aren't related to text, for example, accelerators that might only work on a Japanese keyboard or a bitmap that would only be appropriate for Chinese localized builds, etc.)

- The condition of a resource is a defined symbol that identifies a condition under which this particular copy of the resource is to be used.

The language and condition of a resource are shown in parentheses after the name of the resource in the Workspace window. In this example the resource named IDD_AboutBox is using Finnish as its language and its condition is XX33.

```cpp
IDD_AboutBox (Finnish - XX33)
```

### To copy an existing resource and change its language or condition

1. In the .rc file or in the [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md) window, right-click the resource you want to copy.

2. Choose **Insert Copy** from the shortcut menu.

3. In the **Insert Resource Copy** dialog box:

   - For the **Language** list box, select the language.

   - In the **Condition** box, type the condition.
