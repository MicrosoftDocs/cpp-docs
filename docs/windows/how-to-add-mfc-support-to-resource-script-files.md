# How to: Add MFC Support to Resource Script Files

Normally, when you build an MFC application for Windows using the [MFC Application Wizard](../mfc/reference/mfc-application-wizard.md), the wizard generates a basic set of files (including a resource script (.rc) file) that contains the core features of the Microsoft Foundation classes (MFC). However, if you are editing an .rc file for a Windows application that is not based on MFC, the following features specific to the MFC framework are not available:

- MFC code wizards

- Menu prompt strings

- List contents for combo box controls

- ActiveX control hosting

However, you can add MFC support to existing .rc files that do not have it.

### To add MFC support to .rc files

1. Open the resource script file.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).

2. In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), highlight the resources folder (for example, MFC.rc).

3. In the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), set the **MFC Mode** property to **True**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In addition to setting this flag, the .rc file must be part of an MFC project. For example, just setting **MFC Mode** to **True** on an .rc file in a Win32 project won't give you any of the MFC features.
