# Windows Desktop Applications (C++)
This section discusses how to create C++ desktop applications that run in a window.  
> [!TIP]  
> For Windows 10, you can use the Desktop App Converter to package your existing desktop application for deployment through the Microsoft Store. For more information, see [Using Visual C++ Runtime in Centennial project](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/07/07/using-visual-c-runtime-in-centennial-project) and [Bring your desktop app to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) with the Desktop Bridge](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-root).
