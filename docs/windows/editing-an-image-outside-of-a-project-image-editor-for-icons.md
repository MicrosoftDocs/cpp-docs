# Editing an Image Outside of a Project (Image Editor for Icons)
You can open and edit images in the development environment just as you would in any graphics application. The images you work with need not be part of a Visual Studio project for stand-alone editing.  
  
### To open a bitmap for stand-alone editing  
  
1.  From the **File** menu, click **Open**.  
  
2.  In the **Files of Type** box, click **All Files**.  
  
3.  Locate and open the image you want to edit.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
