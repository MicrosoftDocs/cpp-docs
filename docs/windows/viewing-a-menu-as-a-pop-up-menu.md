# Viewing a Menu as a Pop-up Menu

Normally, when you are working in the **Menu** editor, a menu resource is displayed as a menu bar. However, you might have menu resources that are added to the application's menu bar while the program is running.

### To view a menu resource as a pop-up menu

1. Right-click the menu and choose **View as Popup** from the shortcut menu.

   This is only a viewing preference and will not modify your menu.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To change back to the menu-bar view, click **View as Popup** again (which removes the check mark and returns your menu-bar view).

## Requirements

Win32
