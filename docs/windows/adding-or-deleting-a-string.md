# Adding or Deleting a String
You can quickly insert new entries into the string table using the **String** editor. New strings are placed at the end of the table and are given the next available identifier. You can then edit the **ID**, **Value**, or **Caption** properties in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window) as needed.  
  
 The **String** editor makes sure you do not use an ID that's already in use. If you select an ID already in use, the **String** editor will notify you and then assign a generic unique ID, for example `IDS_STRING58113`.  
  
### To add a string table entry  
  
1.  Open the string table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  Right-click within the string table and choose **New String** from the shortcut menu.  
  
3.  In the **String** editor, select an **ID** from the ID drop-down list or type an ID directly in place.  
  
4.  Edit the **Value**, if necessary.  
  
5.  Type an entry for the **Caption**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Null strings are not allowed in Windows string tables. If you create an entry in the string table that is a null string, you will receive a message asking you to "Please enter a string for this table entry."  
  
### To delete a string table entry  
  
1.  Select the entry you want to delete.  
  
2.  On the **Edit** menu, click **Delete**.  
  
 \- or -  
  
-   Right-click the string you want to delete and choose **Delete** from the shortcut menu.  
  
 \- or -  
  
-   Press the **Delete** key.
