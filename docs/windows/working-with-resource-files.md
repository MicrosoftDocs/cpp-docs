# Working with Resource Files

> [!WARNING]
> This section applies to Windows desktop applications written in C++.
>
> For information about resources in Universal Windows Platform apps written in C++, see [Defining App Resources](/windows/uwp/app-resources/), or on adding resources to C++/CLI (managed) projects, see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the .NET Framework Developer's Guide.

Resources can be composed of a wide range of elements, like:

- Interface elements that provide information to the user such as a bitmap, icon, or cursor.
- Custom resources that contain data and application needs.
- Version resources that are used by setup APIs.
- Menu and dialog box resources.

You can add new resources to your project and modify those resources using the appropriate resource editor. Most Visual C++ wizards will automatically generate an .rc file for your project.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Resource Editors** and **Resource View** aren't available in Express editions.

To manually add resource files to managed projects, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). This article includes how to access resources, display static resources, and assign resource strings to properties.

To globalize and localize resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
