# Working with Resource Files

> [!WARNING]
> This section applies to Windows desktop applications written in C++. For information about resources in Universal Windows Platform apps written in C++, see [Defining App Resources](http://msdn.microsoft.com/476ea844-632c-4467-9ce3-966be1350dd4).  
>   
> For information on adding resources to C++/CLI  projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*.

Resources can be composed of a wide range of elements, including interface elements that provide information to the user (for example a bitmap, icon, or cursor); custom resources that contain data an application needs; version resources that are used by setup APIs; and menu and dialog box resources.

You can add new resources to your project and modify those resources using the appropriate resource editor. Most Visual C++ wizards will automatically generate an .rc file for your project.

For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
