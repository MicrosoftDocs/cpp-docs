# Associating a Menu Command with an Accelerator Key
There are often times you want a menu command and a keyboard combination to issue the same program command. You do this by using the **Menu** editor to assign the same resource identifier to the menu command and to an entry in your application's accelerator table. You then edit the [Caption](../windows/menu-command-properties.md) of the menu command to show the name of the accelerator key.  
  
### To associate a menu command with an accelerator key  
  
1.  In the **Menu** editor, select the menu command you want.  
  
2.  In the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), add the name of the accelerator key to the **Caption** property:  
  
    -   Following the menu caption, type the escape sequence for a tab (\t), so that all the menu's accelerator keys are left aligned.  
  
    -   Type the name of the modifier key (**Ctrl**, **Alt**, or **Shift**) followed by a plus sign (**+**) and the name, letter, or symbol of the additional key.  
  
         For example, to assign **Ctrl**+**O** to the **Open** command on the **File** menu, you modify the menu command's **Caption** so that it looks like this:  
  
        ```  
        &Open...\tCtrl+O   
        ```  
  
         The menu command in the **Menu** editor is updated to reflect the new caption as you type it.  
  
3.  [Create the accelerator-table entry](../windows/adding-an-entry-to-an-accelerator-table.md) in the **Accelerator** editor and assign it the same identifier as the menu command. Use a key combination that you think will be easy to remember.
