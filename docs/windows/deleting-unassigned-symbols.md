# Deleting Unassigned Symbols
### To delete an unassigned (unused) symbol  
  
1.  In the [Resource Symbols dialog box](../windows/resource-symbols-dialog-box.md), select the symbol that you want to delete, and click **Delete**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Before deleting an unused symbol in a resource file, make sure it is not used elsewhere in the program or by resource files included at compile time.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).
