# Sizing Individual Controls

Use the sizing handles to resize a control. When the pointer is positioned on a sizing handle, it changes shape to indicate the directions in which the control can be resized. Active sizing handles are solid; if a sizing handle is hollow, the control cannot be resized along that axis.

You can also change the size of a control by snapping the control to guides or margins, or by moving one snapped control and guide away from another.

### To size a control

1. Select the control.

2. Drag the sizing handles to change the size of the control:

   - Sizing handles at the top and sides change the horizontal or vertical size.

   - Sizing handles at the corners change both horizontal and vertical size.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can resize the control one dialog unit (DLU) at a time by holding down the **Shift** key and using the **Right Arrow** and **Down Arrow** keys.

### To automatically size a control to fit the text within it

1. Choose **Size to Content** from the **Format** menu.

\- or -

- Right-click the control and choose **Size to Content** from the shortcut menu.
