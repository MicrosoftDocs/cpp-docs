# Image Editor for Icons

The Image editor has an extensive set of tools for creating and editing images, as well as features to help you create toolbar bitmaps. In addition to bitmaps, icons, and cursors, you can edit images in GIF or JPEG format using commands on the **Image** menu and tools on the **Image Editor** toolbar.

With the Image editor, you can:

- [Edit Graphical Resources](../windows/editing-graphical-resources-image-editor-for-icons.md)

- [Work with Color](../windows/working-with-color-image-editor-for-icons.md)

- [Work with Icons and Cursors: Image Resources for Display Devices](../windows/icons-and-cursors-image-resources-for-display-devices-image-editor-for-icons.md)

- [Use Accelerator Keys for Image Editor Commands](../windows/accelerator-keys-image-editor-for-icons.md)

The **Image Editor** window shows two views of an image, with a split bar separating the two panes. You can drag the split bar from side to side to change the relative sizes of the panes. The active pane displays a selection border.

The **Image Editor** window can be adjusted to fit your needs and preferences. You can [change the magnification factor](../windows/changing-the-magnification-factor-image-editor-for-icons.md) and [display or hide the pixel grid](../windows/displaying-or-hiding-the-pixel-grid-image-editor-for-icons.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Using the **Image Editor**, you can view 32-bit images, but you cannot edit them.

## Visual Studio Image Library

You can download at no cost the **Visual Studio Image Library** which contains many animations, bitmaps, and icons that you can use in your applications. For more information about how to download the library, see [The Visual Studio Image Library](/visualstudio/designers/the-visual-studio-image-library).

## Managed Resources

You can use the **Image** editor and the [Binary editor](binary-editor.md) to work with resource files in managed projects. Any managed resources you want to edit must be linked resources. The Visual Studio resource editors do not support editing embedded resources.

For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
