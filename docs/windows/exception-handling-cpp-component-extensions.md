# Exception Handling  (C++ Component Extensions)

Applications compiled with the `/ZW` compiler option or `/clr` compiler option both use *exceptions* to handle unexpected errors during program execution. The following topics discuss exception handling in either C++/CX or C++/CLI applications.

## In This Section

[Basic Concepts in Using Managed Exceptions](../dotnet/basic-concepts-in-using-managed-exceptions.md)  
Describes throwing exceptions and using **try**/**catch** blocks.

[Differences in Exception Handling Behavior Under /CLR](../dotnet/differences-in-exception-handling-behavior-under-clr.md)  
Discusses the differences from the standard behavior of C++ exception handling.

[finally](../dotnet/finally.md)  
Discusses how to use the finally keyword.

[How to: Define and Install a Global Exception Handler](../dotnet/how-to-define-and-install-a-global-exception-handler.md)  
Demonstrates how unhandled exceptions can be captured.

[How to: Catch Exceptions in Native Code Thrown from MSIL](../dotnet/how-to-catch-exceptions-in-native-code-thrown-from-msil.md)  
Discusses how to catch CLR and C++ exceptions in native code.

[How to: Define and Install a Global Exception Handler](../dotnet/how-to-define-and-install-a-global-exception-handler.md)  
Demonstrates how to catch all unhandled exceptions.
