# Exception Handling  (C++ Component Extensions)
Applications compiled with the **/ZW** compiler option or **/clr** compiler option both use *exceptions* to handle unexpected errors during program execution. The following topics discuss exception handling in either C++/CX or C++/CLI applications.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Basic Concepts in Using Managed Exceptions](../dotnet/basic-concepts-in-using-managed-exceptions.md)  
 Describes throwing exceptions and using `try`/`catch` blocks.  
  
 [Differences in Exception Handling Behavior Under /CLR](../dotnet/differences-in-exception-handling-behavior-under-clr.md)  
 Discusses the differences from the standard behavior of C++ exception handling.  
  
 [finally](../dotnet/finally.md)  
 Discusses how to use the finally keyword.  
  
 [How to: Define and Install a Global Exception Handler](../dotnet/how-to-define-and-install-a-global-exception-handler.md)  
 Demonstrates how unhandled exceptions can be captured.  
  
 [How to: Catch Exceptions in Native Code Thrown from MSIL](../dotnet/how-to-catch-exceptions-in-native-code-thrown-from-msil.md)  
 Discusses how to catch CLR and C++ exceptions in native code.  
  
 [How to: Define and Install a Global Exception Handler](../dotnet/how-to-define-and-install-a-global-exception-handler.md)  
 Demonstrates how to catch all unhandled exceptions.
