# CancelTransitionPolicy Enumeration

Indicates how an asynchronous operationâ€™s attempt to transition to a terminal state of completed or error should behave with respect to a client-requested canceled state.

## Syntax

```cpp
enum CancelTransitionPolicy;
```

## Members

### Values

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|`RemainCanceled`|If the asynchronous operation is currently in a client-requested canceled state, this indicates that it will stay in the canceled state as opposed to transitioning to a terminal completed or error state.|
|`TransitionFromCanceled`|If the asynchronous operation is currently in a client-requested canceled state, this indicates that state should transition from that canceled state to the terminal state of completed or error as determined by the call that utilizes this flag.|

## Requirements

**Header:** async.h

**Namespace:** Microsoft::WRL
