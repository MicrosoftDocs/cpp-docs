# Filling a Bounded Area of an Image with a Color (Image Editor for Icons)
The Image editor provides the **Fill** tool for filling any enclosed image area with the current drawing color or the current background color.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Tool tips appear when you hover your cursor over a toolbar button. These tips can help you identify the function of each button.  
  
### To use the fill tool  
  
1.  On the **Image Editor** toolbar (or the **Image** menu, **Tools** command), click the **Fill** tool.  
  
2.  If necessary, choose drawing colors: In the [Colors palette](../windows/colors-window-image-editor-for-icons.md), click the left mouse button to select a foreground color or the right mouse button to select a background color.  
  
3.  Move the **Fill** tool to the area you want to fill.  
  
4.  Click the left or right mouse button to fill with the foreground color or the background color, respectively.
