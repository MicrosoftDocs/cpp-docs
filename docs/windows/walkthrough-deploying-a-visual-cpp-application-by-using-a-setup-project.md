# Walkthrough: Deploy a Visual C++ application by using a setup project

In this walkthrough, you'll create a sample app in Visual Studio, then create a setup project to deploy your app to another computer.

Instructions for creating a new project vary depending on which version of Visual Studio you've installed. To see the documentation for your preferred version of Visual Studio, use the **Version** selector control. It's found at the top of the table of contents on this page.

## Prerequisites

You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:

::: moniker range="=msvc-170"

- A computer with Visual Studio 2022 installed. The installation must include the **Desktop development with C++** workload, and the **C++ MFC for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)** optional component.

- The Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects extension. The extension is free for Visual Studio developers and adds the functionality of the setup and deployment project templates to Visual Studio.

- To test your deployment, another computer that doesn't have the Visual C++ libraries installed.

::: moniker-end

## Add items to the setup project

The setup project lets you specify where the components of your app are installed when deployed on a target machine.

### To add app components to the setup project

1. In the **File System (MyMFCAppSetup)** editor window, select the **File System or Target Machine** > **Application Folder** node.

1. On the menu bar, select **Project** > **Add** > **Project Output** to open the **Add Project Output Group** dialog box.

1. In the dialog box, select **Primary Output** and choose **OK**. A new item named **Primary Output from ProjectName (Active)** appears in the File System window.

1. Right-click the **Application Folder** node and select **Add** > **Assembly** to open the **Select Component** dialog box. Select and add any required DLLs needed by the program. For more information about how to identify required libraries, see [Determining which DLLs to redistribute](determining-which-dlls-to-redistribute.md).

1. In the list of items in the **Application Folder**, right-click **Primary Output from ProjectName (Active)** and choose **Create Shortcut to Primary Output from ProjectName (Active)**. A new item named **Shortcut to Primary Output from ProjectName (Active)** appears. You may rename the shortcut item, then drag and drop the item into the **User's Programs Menu** node on the left side of the window. This item causes the setup to create a shortcut to the app in the Start menu.

1. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Configuration Manager** to open the Configuration Manager dialog.

1. In the Configuration Manager dialog, in the **Project** table under the **Build** column, check the box for the deployment project. Choose **Close** to save your changes and close the dialog.

1. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the MFC project and the deployment project.

1. In the solution folder, locate the `setup.exe` program that was built by the deployment project. You can copy this file (and the `.msi` file) to install the application and its required library files on another computer.

## Test your deployment

To test your deployment, copy the deployment files to a second computer that doesn't have the Visual C++ libraries installed. Run the setup program. If your app loads and runs normally, and you don't get a runtime error about missing libraries or components, then your deployment is successful.

For application testing, you can create a deployment setup program that installs a debug version of your app, along with debug libraries, on machines you control. Debug apps and debug libraries aren't licensed for redistribution, and can't be deployed to customer machines. For more information, see [Preparing a test machine to run a debug executable](../windows/preparing-a-test-machine-to-run-a-debug-executable.md).
