# Custom Controls in the Dialog Editor (C++)

The Dialog editor lets you use existing "custom" or "user" controls in a dialog box template.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom controls in this sense are not to be confused with ActiveX controls. ActiveX controls were sometimes called OLE custom controls. Also, don't confuse these controls with the owner-drawn controls in Windows.

This functionality is intended to let you use controls other than those supplied by Windows. At run time, the control is associated with a window class (not the same as a C++ class). A more common way to accomplish the same task is to install any control, such as a static control, in your dialog box. Then at run time, in the [OnInitDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#oninitdialog) function, remove that control and replace it with your own custom control.

This is an old technique. Today you are advised in most cases to write an ActiveX control or subclass a Windows common control.

For these custom controls, you are limited to:

- Setting the location in the dialog box.

- Typing a caption.

- Identifying the name of the control's Windows class (your application code must register the control by this name).

- Typing a 32-bit hexadecimal value that sets the control's style.

- Setting the extended style.

For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps).
