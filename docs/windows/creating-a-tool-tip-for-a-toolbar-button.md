# Creating a Tool Tip for a Toolbar Button

### To create a tool tip

1. Select the toolbar button.

2. In the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), in the **Prompt** property field, add a description of the button for the status bar; after the message, add `\n` and the tool tip name.

A common example of a tool tip is the **Print** button in **WordPad**:

1. Open **WordPad**.

2. Hover your mouse pointer over the **Print** toolbar button.

3. Notice that the word `Print` now is floating under your mouse pointer.

4. Look at the status bar (at the very bottom of the **WordPad** window) - notice that it now shows the text `Prints the active document`.

The `Print` in **Step 3** is the "Tool tip name," and the `Prints the active document` from **Step 4** is the "description of the button for the status bar."

If you want this effect using the **Toolbar** editor, you set the **Prompt** property to `Prints the active document\nPrint`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can edit prompt text using the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).
