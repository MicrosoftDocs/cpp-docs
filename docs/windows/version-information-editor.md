# Version Information Editor
Version information consists of company and product identification, a product release number, and copyright and trademark notification. With the **Version Information** editor, you create and maintain this data, which is stored in the version information resource. The version information resource is not required by an application, but it is a useful place to collect information that identifies the application. Version information is also used by setup APIs.  
  
 A version information resource has an upper block and one or more lower blocks: a single fixed-information block at the top and one or more version information blocks at the bottom (for other languages and/or character sets). The top block has both editable numeric boxes and selectable drop-down lists. The lower blocks have only editable text boxes.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Windows standard is to have only one version resource, named VS_VERSION_INFO.  
  
 The **Version Information** editor enables you to:  
  
-   [Edit a string in a version information resource](../windows/editing-a-string-in-a-version-information-resource.md)  
  
-   [Add version information for another language (new version info block)](../windows/adding-version-information-for-another-language.md)  
  
-   [Delete a version information block](../windows/deleting-a-version-information-block.md)  
  
-   [Access version information from within your program](../windows/accessing-version-information-from-within-your-program.md)  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  While using the **Version Information** editor, in many instances you can right-click to display a shortcut menu of resource-specific commands. For example, if you click while pointing to a block header entry, the shortcut menu shows the **New Version Block Info** and **Delete Version Block Info** commands.
