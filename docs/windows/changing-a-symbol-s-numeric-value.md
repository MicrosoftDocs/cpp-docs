# Changing a Symbol&#39;s Numeric Value
For symbols associated with a single resource, you can use the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window) to change the symbol value. You can use the [Resource Symbols dialog box](../windows/resource-symbols-dialog-box.md) to change the value of symbols not currently assigned to a resource. For more information, see [Changing Unassigned Symbols](../windows/changing-unassigned-symbols.md).  
  
### To change a symbol value assigned to a single resource or object  
  
1.  In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), select the resource.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, type the symbol name followed by an equal sign and an integer in the **ID** box, for example:  
  
    ```  
    IDC_EDITNAME=5100  
    ```  
  
 The new value is stored in the symbol header file the next time you save the project. Only the symbol name remains visible in the ID box; the equal sign and value are not displayed after they are validated.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*.
