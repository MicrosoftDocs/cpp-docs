# Finding an Entry in an Accelerator Table
### To find an entry in an open accelerator table  
  
1.  Open the accelerator table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  Click a column head to sort the contents of the column alphabetically. For example, click **ID** to display all the IDs in your accelerator table alphabetically.  
  
 You can then scan the list and find the entry.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.*
