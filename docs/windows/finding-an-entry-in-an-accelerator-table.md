# Finding an Entry in an Accelerator Table

### To find an entry in an open accelerator table

1. Open the accelerator table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).

2. Click a column head to sort the contents of the column alphabetically. For example, click **ID** to display all the IDs in your accelerator table alphabetically.

You can then scan the list and find the entry.

For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*.
