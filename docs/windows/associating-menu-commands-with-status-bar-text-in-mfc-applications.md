# Associating Menu Commands with Status Bar Text in MFC Applications

Your application can display descriptive text for each of the menu commands a user may select. You do this by assigning a text string to each menu command using the **Prompt** property in the **Properties** window. If you have a string in the [string table](../windows/string-editor.md) whose ID is the same as the command, an MFC application will automatically display this string resource in the status bar of the running application when a user hovers over a menu item.

### To associate a menu command with a status bar text string

1. In the **Menu** editor, select the menu command.

2. In the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), type the associated status bar text in the **Prompt** box.

## Requirements
