# Creating a Menu

> [!NOTE]
> The **Resource Window** is not available in Express editions.

### To create a standard menu

1. From the **View** menu, click on **Resource View** and then right-click on the **Menu** heading and choose **Add Resource**. Choose **Menu**.

2. Select the **New Item** box (the rectangle that contains "Type Here") on the menu bar.

3. Type a name for your new menu, for example, "File".

   The text you type appears in both the **Menu** editor and in the **Caption** box in the [Properties Window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window). You can edit the properties for your new menu in either location.

   Once you have given your new menu a name on the menu bar, the new-item box shifts to the right (to allow you to add another menu), and another new-item box opens below your first menu so you can add menu commands to it.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To create a single-item menu on the menu bar, set the **Popup** property to **False**.
