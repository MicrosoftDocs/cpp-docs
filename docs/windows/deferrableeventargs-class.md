# DeferrableEventArgs Class

A template class used for the event argument types for deferrals.

## Syntax

```cpp
template <
typename TEventArgsInterface,
typename TEventArgsClass
>
class DeferrableEventArgs : public TEventArgsInterface
```

### Parameters

*TEventArgsInterface*  
The interface type that declares the arguments for a deferred event.

*TEventArgsClass*  
The class that implements *TEventArgsInterface*.

## Members

### Public Methods

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[DeferrableEventArgs::GetDeferral Method](../windows/deferrableeventargs-getdeferral-method.md)|Gets a reference to the [Deferral](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=526520) object which represents a deferred event.|
|[DeferrableEventArgs::InvokeAllFinished Method](../windows/deferrableeventargs-invokeallfinished-method.md)|Called to indicate that all processing to handle a deferred event is complete.|

## Remarks

Instances of this class are passed to event handlers for deferred events. The template parameters represent an interface that defines the details of the event arguments for a specific type of deferred event, and a class that implements that interface.

The class appears as the first argument to an event handler for a deferred event. You can call the [GetDeferral](../windows/deferrableeventargs-getdeferral-method.md) method to get the [Deferral](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=526520) object from which you can get all the information about the deferred event. After completing the event handling, you should call Complete on the Deferral object. You should then call [InvokeAllFinished](../windows/deferrableeventargs-invokeallfinished-method.md) at the end of the event handler method, which ensures that the completion of all deferred events is communicated properly.

## Requirements

**Header:** event.h

**Namespace:** Microsoft::WRL
