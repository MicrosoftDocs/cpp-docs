# Shrinking or Stretching an Entire Image (Image Editor for Icons)

### To shrink or stretch an entire image

   If a part of the image is currently selected and you want to select the entire image, click anywhere on the image outside the current selection border.

2. Hold down the **Shift** key and drag a sizing handle until the image is the desired size.
