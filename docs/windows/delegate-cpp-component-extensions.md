# delegate  (C++ Component Extensions)

Declares a type that represents a function pointer.

## All Runtimes

Both the Windows Runtime and common language runtime support delegates.

### Remarks

**delegate** is a context-sensitive keyword. For more information, see [Context-Sensitive Keywords](../windows/context-sensitive-keywords-cpp-component-extensions.md).

To detect at compile time if a type is a delegate, use the `__is_delegate()` type trait. For more information, see [Compiler Support for Type Traits](../windows/compiler-support-for-type-traits-cpp-component-extensions.md).

## Windows Runtime

C++/CX supports delegates with the following syntax.

### Syntax

```cpp
access
delegate
return-type
delegate-type-identifier
(
[ parameters ]
)  
```

### Parameters

*access*  
(optional) The accessibility of the delegate, which can be **public** (the default) or **private**. The function prototype can also be qualified with the **const** or **volatile** keywords.

*return-type*  
The return type of the function prototype.

*delegate-type-identifier*  
The name of the declared delegate type.

*parameters*  
(Optional) The types and identifiers of the function prototype.

### Remarks

Use the *delegate-type-identifier* to declare an event with the same prototype as the delegate. For more information, see [Delegates (C++/CX)](../cppcx/delegates-c-cx.md).

### Requirements

Compiler option: `/ZW`

## Common Language Runtime

The common language runtime supports delegates with the following syntax.

### Syntax

```cpp
access
delegate
function_declaration
```

### Parameters

*access*  
(optional) The accessibility of the delegate outside of the assembly can be public or private.  The default is private.  Inside a class, a delegate can have any accessibility.

*function_declaration*  
The signature of the function that can be bound to the delegate. The return type of a delegate can be any managed type. For interoperability reasons, it is recommended that the return type of a delegate be a CLS type.

To define an unbound delegate, the first parameter in *function_declaration* should be the type of the **this** pointer for the object.

### Remarks

Delegates are multicast: the "function pointer" can be bound to one or more methods within a managed class. The **delegate** keyword defines a multicast delegate type with a specific method signature.

A delegate can also be bound to a method of a value class, such as a static method.

A delegate has the following characteristics:

- It inherits from `System::MulticastDelegate`.

- It has a constructor that takes two arguments: a pointer to a managed class or NULL (in the case of binding to a static method) and a fully qualified method of the specified type.

- It has a method called `Invoke`, whose signature matches the declared signature of the delegate.

When a delegate is invoked, its function(s) are called in the order they were attached.

The return value of a delegate is the return value from its last attached member function.

Delegates cannot be overloaded.

Delegates can be bound or unbound.

When you instantiate a bound delegate, the first argument shall be an object reference. The second argument of a delegate instantiation shall either be the address of a method of a managed class object, or a pointer to a method of a value type. The second argument of a delegate instantiation must name the method with the full class scope syntax and apply the address-of operator.

When you instantiate an unbound delegate, the first argument shall either be the address of a method of a managed class object, or a pointer to a method of a value type. The argument must name the method with the full class scope syntax and apply the address-of operator.

When creating a delegate to a static or global function, only one parameter is required: the function (optionally, the address of the function).

For more information on delegates, see

- [How to: Define and Use Delegates (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/how-to-define-and-use-delegates-cpp-cli.md)

- [Generic Delegates (Visual C++)](../windows/generic-delegates-visual-cpp.md)

### Requirements

Compiler option: `/clr`

### Examples

The following example shows how to declare, initialize, and invoke delegates.

```cpp
// mcppv2_delegate.cpp
// compile with: /clr
using namespace System;

// declare a delegate
public delegate void MyDel(int i);

ref class A {
public:
   void func1(int i) {
      Console::WriteLine("in func1 {0}", i);
   }

   void func2(int i) {
      Console::WriteLine("in func2 {0}", i);
   }

   static void func3(int i) {
      Console::WriteLine("in static func3 {0}", i);
   }
};

int main () {
   A ^ a = gcnew A;

   // declare a delegate instance
   MyDel^ DelInst;

   // test if delegate is initialized
   if (DelInst)  
      DelInst(7);

   // assigning to delegate
   DelInst = gcnew MyDel(a, &A::func1);

   // invoke delegate
   if (DelInst)  
      DelInst(8);

   // add a function
   DelInst += gcnew MyDel(a, &A::func2);

   DelInst(9);

   // remove a function
   DelInst -= gcnew MyDel(a, &A::func1);

   // invoke delegate with Invoke
   DelInst->Invoke(10);

   // make delegate to static function
   MyDel ^ StaticDelInst = gcnew MyDel(&A::func3);
   StaticDelInst(11);
}
```

```Output
in func1 8

in func1 9

in func2 9

in func2 10

in static func3 11
```
