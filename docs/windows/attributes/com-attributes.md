# COM Attributes

The COM attributes inject code to support numerous areas of COM development and .NET Framework common language runtime development. These areas range from custom interface implementation and support of existing interfaces to supporting stock properties, methods, and events. In addition, support can be found for composite and ActiveX control implementation.
