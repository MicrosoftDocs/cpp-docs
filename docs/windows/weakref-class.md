# WeakRef Class

Represents a *weak reference* that can be used by only the Windows Runtime, not classic COM. A weak reference represents an object that might or might not be accessible.

## Syntax

```cpp
class WeakRef : public ComPtr<IWeakReference>
```

## Remarks

A **WeakRef** object maintains a *strong reference*, which is associated with an object, and can be valid or invalid. Call the `As()` or `AsIID()` method to obtain a strong reference. When the strong reference is valid, it can access the associated object. When the strong reference is invalid (**nullptr**), the associated object is inaccessible.

A **WeakRef** object is typically used to represent an object whose existence is controlled by an external thread or application. For example, construct a **WeakRef** object from a reference to a file object. While the file is open, the strong reference is valid. But if the file is closed, the strong reference becomes invalid.

Note that there is a behavior change in the [As](../windows/weakref-as-method.md), [AsIID](../windows/weakref-asiid-method.md) and [CopyTo](../windows/weakref-copyto-method.md) methods in the Windows 10 SDK. Previously, after calling any of these methods, you could check the WeakRef for **nullptr** to determine if a strong reference was successfully obtained, as in the following code:

```cpp
WeakRef wr;
strongComptrRef.AsWeak(&wr);

// Now suppose that the object strongComPtrRef points to no longer exists
// and the following code tries to get a strong ref from the weak ref:
ComPtr<ISomeInterface> strongRef;
HRESULT hr = wr.As(&strongRef);

// This check won't work with the Windows 10 SDK version of the library.
// Check the input pointer instead.
if(wr == nullptr)  
{
    wprintf(L"Couldnâ€™t get strong ref!");
}
```

The above code does not work when using the Windows 10 SDK (or later). Instead, check the pointer that was passed in for **nullptr**.

```cpp
if (strongRef == nullptr)  
{
    wprintf(L"Couldn't get strong ref!");
}
```
