# Finding Binary Data
You can search for either ASCII strings or hexadecimal bytes. For example, to find "Hello," you can search for either the string "Hello" or for "48 65 6C 6C 6F" (the hexadecimal equivalent).  
  
### To find binary data  
  
1.  From the **Edit** menu, click [Find](/visualstudio/ide/reference/find-command).  
  
2.  In the **Find What** box, select a previous search string from the drop-down list or type the data you want to find.  
  
3.  Select any of the **Find** options.  
  
4.  Click **Find Next**.
