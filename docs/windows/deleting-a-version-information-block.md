# Deleting a Version Information Block
### To delete a version information block  
  
1.  Open the version information resource by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  Right-click the block header you wish to delete then choose **Delete Version Info Block** from the shortcut menu.  
  
     This command deletes the selected header and leaves the remaining version information intact. Please note you cannot undo the action.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps).
