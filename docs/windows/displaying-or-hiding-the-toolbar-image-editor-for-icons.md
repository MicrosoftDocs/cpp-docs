# Displaying or Hiding the Toolbar (Image Editor for Icons)
Since many of the drawing tools are available from the [keyboard](../windows/accelerator-keys-image-editor-for-icons.md), it is sometimes useful to hide the **Image Editor** toolbar.  
  
### To display or hide the Image Editor toolbar  
  
1.  On the **View** menu click **Toolbars** then choose **Image Editor**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Elements from this toolbar will appear unavailable when an image file from the current project or solution is not open in the **Image Editor**. See [Creating an Icon or Other Image](../windows/creating-an-icon-or-other-image-image-editor-for-icons.md), for information on adding image files to your projects.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
