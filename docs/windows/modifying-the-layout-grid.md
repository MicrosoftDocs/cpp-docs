# Modifying the Layout Grid

When you are placing or arranging controls in a dialog box, you can use the layout grid for more precise positioning. When the grid is turned on, controls appear to "snap to" the dotted lines of the grid as if magnetized. You can turn this "snap to grid" feature on and off and change the size of the layout grid cells.

### To turn the layout grid on or off

1. From the **Format** menu, choose **Guide Settings**.

2. In the [Guide Settings Dialog Box](../windows/guide-settings-dialog-box.md), select or clear the **Grid** button.

   You can still control the grid in individual **Dialog** editor windows using the **Toggle Grid** button on the [Dialog Editor Toolbar](../windows/showing-or-hiding-the-dialog-editor-toolbar.md).

### To change the size of the layout grid

1. From the **Format** menu, choose **Guide Settings**.

2. In the [Guide Settings Dialog Box](../windows/guide-settings-dialog-box.md), type the height and width in DLUs for the cells in the grid. The minimum height or width is 4 DLUs. For more information on DLUs, see [The Arrangement of Controls on Dialog Boxes](../windows/arrangement-of-controls-on-dialog-boxes.md).

For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/index) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide*. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](/dotnet/framework/resources/creating-resource-files-for-desktop-apps). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](/dotnet/standard/globalization-localization/index).
