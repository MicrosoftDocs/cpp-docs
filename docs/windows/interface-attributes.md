# Interface Attributes

The following attributes apply to the [interface (or __interface)](../cpp/interface.md) C++ keyword.

|Attribute|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|[async_uuid](../windows/async-uuid.md)|Specifies the UUID that directs the MIDL compiler to define both synchronous and asynchronous versions of a COM interface.|
|[custom](../windows/custom-cpp.md)|Lets you define your own attributes.|
|[dispinterface](../windows/dispinterface.md)|Places an interface in the .idl file as a dispatch interface.|
|[dual](../windows/dual.md)|Places an interface in the .idl file as a dual interface.|
|[export](../windows/export.md)|Causes a data structure to be placed in the .idl file.|
|[helpcontext](../windows/helpcontext.md)|Specifies a context ID that lets the user view information about this element in the Help file.|
|[helpfile](../windows/helpfile.md)|Sets the name of the Help file for a type library.|
|[helpstring](../windows/helpstring.md)|Specifies a character string that is used to describe the element to which it applies.|
|[helpstringcontext](../windows/helpstringcontext.md)|Specifies the ID of a help topic in an .hlp or .chm file.|
|[helpstringdll](../windows/helpstringdll.md)|Specifies the name of the DLL to use to perform document string lookup (localization).|
|[hidden](../windows/hidden.md)|Indicates that the item exists but should not be displayed in a user-oriented browser.|
|[library_block](../windows/library-block.md)|Places a construct inside the .idl file's library block.|
|[local](../windows/local-cpp.md)|Allows you to use the MIDL compiler as a header generator when used in the interface header. When used in an individual function, designates a local procedure for which no stubs are generated.|
|[nonextensible](../windows/nonextensible.md)|Specifies that the `IDispatch` implementation includes only the properties and methods listed in the interface description and cannot be extended with additional members at run time. This attribute is only valid on a [dual](../windows/dual.md) interface.|
|[odl](../windows/odl.md)|Identifies an interface as an Object Description Language (ODL) interface.|
|[object](../windows/object-cpp.md)|Identifies a custom interface.|
|[oleautomation](../windows/oleautomation.md)|Indicates that an interface is compatible with Automation.|
|[pointer_default](../windows/pointer-default.md)|Specifies the default pointer attribute for all pointers except top-level pointers that appear in parameter lists.|
|[ptr](../windows/ptr.md)|Designates a pointer as a full pointer.|
|[restricted](../windows/restricted.md)|Designates which members of the library cannot be called arbitrarily.|
|[uuid](../windows/uuid-cpp-attributes.md)|Provides the unique ID for the library|

You must observe these rules for defining an interface:

- Default calling convention is [__stdcall](../cpp/stdcall.md).

- A GUID is supplied for you if you do not supply one.

- No overloaded methods are allowed.

When not specifying the [uuid](../windows/uuid-cpp-attributes.md) attribute and using the same interface name in different attribute projects, the same GUID is generated.
