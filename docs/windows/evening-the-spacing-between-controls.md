# Evening the Spacing Between Controls
The Dialog editor enables you to space controls evenly between the outermost controls selected.  
  
### To even the spacing between controls  
  
1.  Select the controls you want to rearrange.  
  
2.  From the **Format** menu, choose **Space Evenly**, and then choose one of the following spacing alignments:  
  
    -   **Across**: spaces controls evenly between the leftmost and the rightmost control selected.  
  
    -   **Down**: spaces controls evenly between the topmost and the bottommost control selected.
