The `RelogW` function is used to read MSVC events from an input Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) trace and write them into a new, modified ETW trace.

## Syntax

```cpp
enum RESULT_CODE RelogW(
    const wchar_t*          inputLogFile,
    const wchar_t*          outputLogFile,
    const RELOG_DESCRIPTOR* relogDescriptor);
```

### Parameters

*`inputLogFile`*\
The input ETW trace that you wish to read events from.

*`outputLogFile`*\
The file in which to write the new events.

*`relogDescriptor`*\
Pointer to a [`RELOG_DESCRIPTOR`](../other-types/relog-descriptor-struct.md) object. Use this object to configure the relogging session.

### Return Value

A result code from the [`RESULT_CODE`](../other-types/result-code-enum.md) enum.
