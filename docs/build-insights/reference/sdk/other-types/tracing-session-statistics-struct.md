The `TRACING_SESSION_STATISTICS` structure describes statistics on a trace that was collected. Its fields are set when stopping a tracing session.

## Syntax

```cpp
typedef struct TRACING_SESSION_STATISTICS_TAG
{
    unsigned long MSVCEventsLost;
    unsigned long MSVCBuffersLost;
    unsigned long SystemEventsLost;
    unsigned long SystemBuffersLost;

} TRACING_SESSION_STATISTICS;
```

## Members

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| `MSVCEventsLost` | The number of MSVC events that were dropped. |
| `MSVCBuffersLost` | The number of MSVC event buffers that were dropped. |
| `SystemEventsLost` | The number of system events that were dropped. |
| `SystemBuffersLost` | The number of system event buffers that were dropped. |
