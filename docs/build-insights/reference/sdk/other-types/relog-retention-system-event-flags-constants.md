The `RELOG_RETENTION_SYSTEM_EVENT_FLAGS` constants are used to describe which system events to keep in a relogged trace. Use them to initialize the [RELOG_DESCRIPTOR](relog-descriptor-struct.md) structure's `SystemEventsRetentionFlags` field.

## Syntax

```cpp
static const unsigned long long
    RELOG_RETENTION_SYSTEM_EVENT_FLAGS_CPU_SAMPLES = 0x1ULL;

static const unsigned long long
    RELOG_RETENTION_SYSTEM_EVENT_FLAGS_ALL         = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL;
```

## Members

| `RELOG_RETENTION_SYSTEM_EVENT_FLAGS_CPU_SAMPLES` | Keep CPU sample system events in a relogged trace. |
| `RELOG_RETENTION_SYSTEM_EVENT_FLAGS_ALL` | Keep all system events in a relogged trace. |
