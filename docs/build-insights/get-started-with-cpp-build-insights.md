The C++ Build Insights tools are available in Visual Studio 2019. To see the documentation for that version, set the Visual Studio **Version** selector control for this article to Visual Studio 2019. It's found at the top of the table of contents on this page.

C++ Build Insights is a collection of tools that provides increased visibility into the Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) tool chain. The tools collect data about your C++ builds, and present it in a format that can help you answer common questions, like:

- Are my builds sufficiently parallelized?
- What should I include in my pre-compiled header (PCH)?
- Is there a specific bottleneck I should focus on to increase my build speeds?

The main components of this technology are:

- *vcperf.exe*, a command-line utility that you can use to collect traces for your builds,
- a Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) extension that allows you to view build traces in WPA, and
- the C++ Build Insights SDK, a software development kit for creating your own tools that consume C++ Build Insights data.
