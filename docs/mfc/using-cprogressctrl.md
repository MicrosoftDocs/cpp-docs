# Using CProgressCtrl

You can use the progress control to indicate the progress of a lengthy operation. It is a rectangle that is gradually filled with the system highlight color as the operation progresses.

The progress control is represented in MFC by class [CProgressCtrl](../mfc/reference/cprogressctrl-class.md).

When you initially create the progress control, you specify its size and position, parent window (usually a dialog box), and ID. By using the *dwStyle* parameter, you can also specify various window styles for the control and styles for how it fills.
