# Using the CArchive `<<` and `>>` Operators

`CArchive` provides <\< and >> operators for writing and reading simple data types as well as `CObject`s to and from a file.

#### To store an object in a file via an archive

1. The following example shows how to store an object in a file via an archive:

   [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCSerialization#7](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-the-carchive-output-and-input-operators_1.cpp)]

#### To load an object from a value previously stored in a file

1. The following example shows how to load an object from a value previously stored in a file:

   [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCSerialization#8](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-the-carchive-output-and-input-operators_2.cpp)]

Usually, you store and load data to and from a file via an archive in the `Serialize` functions of `CObject`-derived classes, which you must have declared with the DECLARE_SERIALIZE macro. A reference to a `CArchive` object is passed to your `Serialize` function. You call the `IsLoading` function of the `CArchive` object to determine whether the `Serialize` function has been called to load data from the file or store data to the file.

The `Serialize` function of a serializable `CObject`-derived class typically has the following form:

[!code-cpp[NVC_MFCSerialization#9](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-the-carchive-output-and-input-operators_3.cpp)]

The above code template is exactly the same as the one AppWizard creates for the `Serialize` function of the document (a class derived from `CDocument`). This code template helps you write code that is easier to review, because the storing code and the loading code should always be parallel, as in the following example:

[!code-cpp[NVC_MFCSerialization#10](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-the-carchive-output-and-input-operators_4.cpp)]

The library defines **`<<`** and **`>>`** operators for `CArchive` as the first operand and the following data types and class types as the second operand:

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      `BYTE`\
      `CObject*`\
      `COleCurrency`\
      `COleDateTime`\
      `COleDateTimeSpan`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      `COleVariant`\
      `CString`\
      `CTime` and `CTimeSpan`\
      `Double`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      `DWORD`\
      `Float`\
      `Int`\
      `LONG`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      `POINT` and `CPoint`\
      `RECT` and `CRect`\
      `SIZE` and `CSize`\
      `WORD`
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

> [!NOTE]
> Storing and loading `CObject`s via an archive requires extra consideration. For more information, see [Storing and Loading CObjects via an Archive](../mfc/storing-and-loading-cobjects-via-an-archive.md).

The `CArchive` **`<<`** and **`>>`** operators always return a reference to the `CArchive` object, which is the first operand. This enables you to chain the operators, as illustrated below:

[!code-cpp[NVC_MFCSerialization#11](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-the-carchive-output-and-input-operators_5.cpp)]
