# Creating the Image Lists
Creating image lists is the same whether you use [CListView](../mfc/reference/clistview-class.md) or [CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You only need image lists if your list control includes the `LVS_ICON` style.  
  
 Use class `CImageList` to create one or more image lists (for full-size icons, small icons, and states). See [CImageList](../mfc/reference/cimagelist-class.md), and see [List View Image Lists](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774736) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
 Call [CListCtrl::SetImageList](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#clistctrl__setimagelist) for each image list; pass a pointer to the appropriate `CImageList` object.
