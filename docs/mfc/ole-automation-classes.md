# OLE Automation Classes
These classes support automation clients (applications that control other applications). Automation servers (applications that can be controlled by other applications) are supported through [dispatch maps](../mfc/reference/dispatch-maps.md).  
  
 [COleDispatchDriver](../mfc/reference/coledispatchdriver-class.md)  
 Used to call automation servers from your automation client. When adding a class, this class is used to create type-safe classes for automation servers that provide a type library.  
  
 [COleDispatchException](../mfc/reference/coledispatchexception-class.md)  
 An exception resulting from an error during OLE automation. Automation exceptions are thrown by automation servers and caught by automation clients.
