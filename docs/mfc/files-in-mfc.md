# Files in MFC
In the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC), class [CFile](../mfc/reference/cfile-class.md) handles normal file I/O operations. This family of articles explains how to open and close files as well as read and write data to those files. It also discusses file status operations. For a description of how to use the object-based serialization features of MFC as an alternative way of reading and writing data in files, see the article [Serialization](../mfc/serialization-in-mfc.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When you use MFC `CDocument` objects, the framework does much of the serialization work for you. In particular, the framework creates and uses the `CFile` object. You only have to write code in your override of the `Serialize` member function of class `CDocument`.  
  
 The `CFile` class provides an interface for general-purpose binary file operations. The `CStdioFile` and `CMemFile` classes derived from `CFile` and the `CSharedFile` class derived from `CMemFile` supply more specialized file services.  
  
 For more information about alternatives to MFC file handling, see [File Handling](../c-runtime-library/file-handling.md) in the *Run-Time Library Reference*.  
  
 For information about derived `CFile` classes, see the [MFC hierarchy chart](../mfc/hierarchy-chart.md).  
  
## What do you want to do  
 *Use CFile*

-   [Read and write a file with CFile](../mfc/reading-and-writing-files.md)  
  
-   [Close a file with CFile](../mfc/closing-files.md)  
  
-   [Access file status with CFile](../mfc/accessing-file-status.md)  
  
 *Use MFC Serialization (Object Persistence)*  
  
-   [Create a serializable class](../mfc/serialization-making-a-serializable-class.md)
