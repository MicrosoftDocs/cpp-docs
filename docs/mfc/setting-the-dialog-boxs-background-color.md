# Setting the Dialog Box's Background Color

You can set the background color of your dialog boxes by handling `WM_CTLCOLOR` messages for the dialog box window. The color you set is used for only the specified dialog box.

For example, the following code fragment sets the background color of the dialog box to dark grey. The `OnCtlColor` member function is called whenever the dialog box is redrawn:

```cpp
HBRUSH CAboutDlg::OnCtlColor(CDC* pDC, CWnd* pWnd, UINT nCtlColor)
{
    return (HBRUSH)GetStockObject(DKGRAY_BRUSH);
}
```

For the previous code fragment to work:
- add `virtual HBRUSH OnCtlColor(CDC* pDC, CWnd* pWnd, UINT nCtlColor);` to the `protected:` section of the class definition for your dialog.
- add the following to the class definition for your dialog, and change `CMyDialog` to the name of your dialog class:

```cpp
BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CMyDialog, CDialogEx)
    ON_WM_CTLCOLOR()
END_MESSAGE_MAP()
```
