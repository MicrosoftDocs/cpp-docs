# Window Destruction Sequence
In the MFC framework, when the user closes the frame window, the window's default [OnClose](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#onclose) handler calls [DestroyWindow](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#destroywindow). The last member function called when the Windows window is destroyed is [OnNcDestroy](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#onncdestroy), which does some cleanup, calls the [Default](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#default) member function to perform Windows cleanup, and lastly calls the virtual member function [PostNcDestroy](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#postncdestroy). The [CFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md) implementation of `PostNcDestroy` deletes the C++ window object.
