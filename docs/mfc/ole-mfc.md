# OLE (MFC)

Implementing OLE functionality in your program affects your user interface in several ways:

- Visual editing (in-place activation) displays the user interface of another program in your program's windows and modifies your program's menus with items from the other program.

- Drag and drop allows users to drag objects within and between windows and even between programs.

- Trackers provide visual cues to the state of objects during visual editing and drag and drop.
