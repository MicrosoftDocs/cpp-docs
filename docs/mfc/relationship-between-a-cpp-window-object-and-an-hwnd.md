# Relationship Between a C++ Window Object and an HWND

The window *object* is an object of the C++ `CWnd` class (or a derived class) that your program creates directly. It comes and goes in response to your program's constructor and destructor calls. The Windows *window*, on the other hand, is an opaque handle to an internal Windows data structure that corresponds to a window and consumes system resources when present. A Windows window is identified by a "window handle" (`HWND`) and is created after the `CWnd` object is created by a call to the `Create` member function of class `CWnd`. The window may be destroyed either by a program call or by a user's action. The window handle is stored in the window object's *m_hWnd* member variable. The following figure shows the relationship between the C++ window object and the Windows window. Creating windows is discussed in [Creating Windows](../mfc/creating-windows.md). Destroying windows is discussed in [Destroying Window Objects](../mfc/destroying-window-objects.md).
