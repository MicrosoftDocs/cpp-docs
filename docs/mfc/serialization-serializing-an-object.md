# Serialization: Serializing an Object
The article [Serialization: Making a Serializable Class](../mfc/serialization-making-a-serializable-class.md) shows how to make a class serializable. Once you have a serializable class, you can serialize objects of that class to and from a file via a [CArchive](../mfc/reference/carchive-class.md) object. This article explains:  
  
-   [What a CArchive object is](../mfc/what-is-a-carchive-object.md).  
  
-   [Two ways to create a CArchive](../mfc/two-ways-to-create-a-carchive-object.md).  
  
-   [How to use the CArchive <\< and >> operators](../mfc/using-the-carchive-output-and-input-operators.md).  
  
-   [Storing and loading CObjects via an archive](../mfc/storing-and-loading-cobjects-via-an-archive.md).  
  
 You can let the framework create the archive for your serializable document or explicitly create the `CArchive` object yourself. You can transfer data between a file and your serializable object by using the <\< and >> operators for `CArchive` or, in some cases, by calling the `Serialize` function of a `CObject`-derived class.
