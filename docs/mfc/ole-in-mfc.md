# OLE in MFC
These articles explain the fundamentals of OLE programming using MFC. MFC provides the easiest way to write programs that use OLE:  
  
-   To use OLE visual editing (in-place activation).  
  
-   To work as OLE containers or servers.  
  
-   To implement drag-and-drop functionality.  
  
-   To work with date and time data.  
  
-   To manage the state data of MFC modules, including exported DLL function entry points, OLE/COM interface entry points, and window procedure entry points.  
  
 You can also use [Automation](../mfc/automation.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The term OLE denotes the technologies associated with linking and embedding, including OLE containers, OLE servers, OLE items, in-place activation (or visual editing), trackers, drag and drop, and menu merging. The term Active applies to the Component Object Model (COM) and COM-based objects such as ActiveX controls. OLE Automation is now called Automation.  
  
## In This Section  
 [OLE Background](../mfc/ole-background.md)  
 Discusses OLE and provides conceptual information about how it works.  
  
 [Activation](../mfc/activation-cpp.md)  
 Describes the role of activation in editing OLE items.  
  
 [Containers](../mfc/containers.md)  
 Provides links to using containers in OLE.  
  
 [Data Objects and Data Sources](../mfc/data-objects-and-data-sources-ole.md)  
 Provides links to topics discussing the use of the `COleDataObject` and `COleDataSource` classes.  
  
 [Drag and Drop](../mfc/drag-and-drop-ole.md)  
 Discusses using copying and pasting with OLE.  
  
 [OLE Menus and Resources](../mfc/menus-and-resources-ole.md)  
 Explains the use of menus and resources in MFC OLE document applications.  
  
 [Registration](../mfc/registration.md)  
 Discusses server installation and initialization.  
  
 [Servers](../mfc/servers.md)  
 Describes how to create OLE items (or components) for use by container applications.  
  
 [Trackers](../mfc/trackers.md)  
 Provides information about the `CRectTracker` class, which provides a graphical interface to enable users to interact with OLE client items.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Connection Points](../mfc/connection-points.md)  
 Explains how to implement connection points (formerly known as OLE connection points) using the MFC classes `CCmdTarget` and `CConnectionPoint`.  
  
 [Container/Server COM Components](../mfc/containers-advanced-features.md)  
 Describes the steps necessary to incorporate optional advanced features into existing container applications.  
  
 [The Component Object Model](/windows/desktop/com/the-component-object-model)  
 Describes using OLE without MFC.
