# OLE in MFC

These articles explain the fundamentals of OLE programming using MFC. MFC provides the easiest way to write programs that use OLE:

- To use OLE visual editing (in-place activation).

- To work as OLE containers or servers.

- To implement drag-and-drop functionality.

- To work with date and time data.

- To manage the state data of MFC modules, including exported DLL function entry points, OLE/COM interface entry points, and window procedure entry points.

You can also use [Automation](../mfc/automation.md).

> [!NOTE]
>  The term OLE denotes the technologies associated with linking and embedding, including OLE containers, OLE servers, OLE items, in-place activation (or visual editing), trackers, drag and drop, and menu merging. The term Active applies to the Component Object Model (COM) and COM-based objects such as ActiveX controls. OLE Automation is now called Automation.

## In This Section

[OLE Background](../mfc/ole-background.md)<br/>
Discusses OLE and provides conceptual information about how it works.

[Activation](../mfc/activation-cpp.md)<br/>
Describes the role of activation in editing OLE items.

[Containers](../mfc/containers.md)<br/>
Provides links to using containers in OLE.

[Data Objects and Data Sources](../mfc/data-objects-and-data-sources-ole.md)<br/>
Provides links to topics discussing the use of the `COleDataObject` and `COleDataSource` classes.

[Drag and Drop](../mfc/drag-and-drop-ole.md)<br/>
Discusses using copying and pasting with OLE.

[OLE Menus and Resources](../mfc/menus-and-resources-ole.md)<br/>
Explains the use of menus and resources in MFC OLE document applications.

[Registration](../mfc/registration.md)<br/>
Discusses server installation and initialization.

[Servers](../mfc/servers.md)<br/>
Describes how to create OLE items (or components) for use by container applications.

[Trackers](../mfc/trackers.md)<br/>
Provides information about the `CRectTracker` class, which provides a graphical interface to enable users to interact with OLE client items.

## Related Sections

[Connection Points](../mfc/connection-points.md)<br/>
