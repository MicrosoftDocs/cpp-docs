# Memory Management: Resizable Memory Blocks
The **new** and **delete** operators, described in the article [Memory Management: Examples](../mfc/memory-management-examples.md), are good for allocating and deallocating fixed-size memory blocks and objects. Occasionally, your application may need resizable memory blocks. You must use the standard C run-time library functions [malloc](../c-runtime-library/reference/malloc.md), [realloc](../c-runtime-library/reference/realloc.md), and [free](../c-runtime-library/reference/free.md) to manage resizable memory blocks on the heap.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Mixing the **new** and **delete** operators with the resizable memory-allocation functions on the same memory block will result in corrupted memory in the Debug version of MFC. You should not use **realloc** on a memory block allocated with **new**. Likewise, you should not allocate a memory block with the **new** operator and delete it with **free**, or use the **delete** operator on a block of memory allocated with **malloc**.
