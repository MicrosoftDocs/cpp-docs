# Sequence of Operations for Creating OLE Applications
The following table shows your role and the framework's role in creating OLE linking and embedding applications. These represent options available rather than a sequence of steps to perform.  
  
### Creating OLE Applications  
  
|Task|You do|The framework does|  
|----------|------------|------------------------|  
|Create a COM component.|Run the MFC Application Wizard. Choose **Full-server** or **Mini-server** in the **Compound Document Support** tab.|The framework generates a skeleton application with COM component capability enabled. All of the COM capability can be transferred to your existing application with only slight modification.|  
|Create a container application from scratch.|Run the MFC Application Wizard. Choose **Container** in the **Compound Document Support** tab. Using Class View, go to the source code editor. Fill in code for your COM handler functions.|The framework generates a skeleton application that can insert COM objects created by COM component (server) applications.|  
|Create an application that supports Automation from scratch.|Run the MFC Application Wizard. Choose **Automation** from the **Advanced Features** tab. Use Class View to expose methods and properties in your application for automation.|The framework generates a skeleton application that can be activated and automated by other applications.|
