# Selecting a Graphic Object into a Device Context
This topic applies to using graphic objects in a window's device context. After you [create a drawing object](../mfc/one-stage-and-two-stage-construction-of-objects.md), you must select it into the device context in place of the default object stored there:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocViewSDI#7](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/selecting-a-graphic-object-into-a-device-context_1.cpp)]  
  
## Lifetime of Graphic Objects  
 The graphic object returned by [SelectObject](../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#selectobject) is "temporary." That is, it will be deleted by the [OnIdle](../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#onidle) member function of class `CWinApp` the next time the program gets idle time. As long as you use the object returned by `SelectObject` in a single function without returning control to the main message loop, you will have no problem.
