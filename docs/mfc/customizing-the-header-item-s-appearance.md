# Customizing the Header Item&#39;s Appearance
By setting the *dwStyle* parameter when you first create a header control ([CHeaderCtrl::Create](../mfc/reference/cheaderctrl-class.md#create)), you can define the appearance and behavior of header items or of the header control itself.  
  
 Here is a sampling of the styles you can set, and their purpose:  
  
-   To make a header item look like a pushbutton, use the **HDS_BUTTONS** style.  
  
     Use this style if you want to carry out actions in response to mouse clicks on a header item, such as sorting data by a particular column, as is done in Microsoft Outlook.  
  
-   To give the header items a "hot tracking" appearance when the mouse cursor passes over them, use the **HDS_HOTTRACK** style.  
  
     Hot tracking displays a 3D outline as the pointer passes over an item in an otherwise flat bar.  
  
-   To indicate that the header control should be hidden, use the **HDS_HIDDEN** style.  
  
     The **HDS_HIDDEN** style indicates that the header control is intended to be used as a data container and not a visual control. This style does not automatically hide the control but, instead, affects the behavior of `CHeaderCtrl::Layout`. The value returned in the *cy* member of the `WINDOWPOS` structure will be zero indicating that the control should not be visible to the user.  
  
 For more information about these properties, see [Items](/windows/desktop/Controls/header-controls) in the Windows SDK. For information about adding items to a header control, see [Adding Items to the Header Control](../mfc/adding-items-to-the-header-control.md).
