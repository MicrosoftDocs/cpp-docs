# View Classes (Architecture)
`CView` and its derived classes are child windows that represent the client area of a frame window. Views show data and accept input for a document.  
  
 A view class is associated with a document class and a frame window class using a document-template object.  
  
 [CView](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md)  
 The base class for application-specific views of a document's data. Views display data and accept user input to edit or select the data. Derive your view class(es) from `CView`.  
  
 [CScrollView](../mfc/reference/cscrollview-class.md)  
 The base class for views with scrolling capabilities. Derive your view class from `CScrollView` for automatic scrolling.  
  
## Form and Record Views  
 Form views are also scrolling views. They are based on a dialog box template.  
  
 Record views are derived from form views. In addition to the dialog box template, they also have a connection to a database.  
  
 [CFormView](../mfc/reference/cformview-class.md)  
 A scroll view whose layout is defined in a dialog box template. Derive a class from `CFormView` to implement a user interface based on a dialog box template.  
  
 [CDaoRecordView](../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md)  
 Provides a form view directly connected to a Data Access Object (DAO) recordset object. Like all form views, a `CDaoRecordView` is based on a dialog box template.  
  
 [CHtmlView](../mfc/reference/chtmlview-class.md)  
 Supports a control for Web browsing within an application. The control supports dynamic HTML in MFC.  
  
 [COLEDBRecordView](../mfc/reference/coledbrecordview-class.md)  
 Provides MFC OLE DB support for form views.  
  
 [CRecordView](../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md)  
 Provides a form view directly connected to an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) recordset object. Like all form views, a `CRecordView` is based on a dialog box template.  
  
## Control Views  
 Control views display a control as their view.  
  
 [CCtrlView](../mfc/reference/cctrlview-class.md)  
 The base class for all views associated with Windows controls. The views based on controls are described below.  
  
 [CEditView](../mfc/reference/ceditview-class.md)  
 A view that contains a Windows standard edit control (see [CEdit](../mfc/reference/cedit-class.md)). Edit controls support text editing, searching, replacing, and scrolling capabilities.  
  
 [CRichEditView](../mfc/reference/cricheditview-class.md)  
 A view that contains a Windows rich edit control (see [CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md)). In addition to the capabilities of an edit control, rich edit controls support fonts, colors, paragraph formatting, and embedded OLE objects.  
  
 [CListView](../mfc/reference/clistview-class.md)  
 A view that contains a Windows list control (see [CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md)). A list control displays icons and strings in a manner similar to the right pane of File Explorer.  
  
 [CTreeView](../mfc/reference/ctreeview-class.md)  
 A view that contains a Windows tree control (see [CTreeCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctreectrl-class.md)). A tree control displays icons and strings arranged in a hierarchy in a manner similar to the left pane of File Explorer.
