# AFXDLL Versions
Instead of building your application by statically linking to the MFC object-code libraries, you can build your application to use one of the AFXDLL libraries, which contain MFC in a DLL that multiple running applications can share. For a table of AFXDLL names, see [DLLs: Naming Conventions](../build/naming-conventions-for-mfc-dlls.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  By default, the MFC Application Wizard creates an AFXDLL project. To use static linking of MFC code instead, set the **Use MFC in a static library** option in the MFC Application Wizard. Static linking is not available in the Standard Edition of Visual C++.
