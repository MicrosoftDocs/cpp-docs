# ActiveX Controls

In Visual C++ you can create ActiveX controls using MFC or ATL.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> ActiveX is a legacy technology that should not be used for new development. Many capabilities of ActiveX controls can be performed in a simpler and much more secure way with modern technologies such as HTML5 and JavaScript, modern browser extensions, or WebAssembly modules. For more information, see [A break from the past, part 2: Saying goodbye to ActiveX, VBScript, attachEventâ€¦](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/06/a-break-from-the-past-part-2-saying-goodbye-to-activex-vbscript-attachevent/) and [Native Messaging](/microsoft-edge/extensions/guides/native-messaging) and [Microsoft Edge extensions](/microsoft-edge/extensions) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
