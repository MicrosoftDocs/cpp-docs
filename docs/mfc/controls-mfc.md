# Controls (MFC)
Controls are objects that users can interact with to enter or manipulate data. They commonly appear in dialog boxes or on toolbars. This topic family covers three main kinds of controls:  
  
-   Windows common controls, including owner-drawn controls  
  
-   ActiveX Controls  
  
-   Other control classes supplied by the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC)  
  
## Windows Common Controls  
 The Windows operating system has always provided a number of Windows common controls. These control objects are programmable, and the Visual C++ dialog editor supports adding them to your dialog boxes. The Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) supplies classes that encapsulate each of these controls, as shown in the table [Windows Common Controls and MFC Classes](#_core_windows_common_controls_and_mfc_classes). (Some items in the table have related topics that describe them further. For controls that lack topics, see the documentation for the MFC class.)  
  
 Class [CWnd](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md) is the base class of all window classes, including all of the control classes. 
  
## ActiveX Controls  
 ActiveX controls, formerly known as OLE controls, can be used in dialog boxes in your applications for Windows, or in HTML pages on the World Wide Web. For more information, see [MFC ActiveX Controls](../mfc/mfc-activex-controls.md).  
  
## Other MFC Control Classes  
 In addition to classes that encapsulate all of the Windows common controls and that support programming your own ActiveX controls (or using ActiveX controls supplied by others), MFC supplies the following control classes of its own:  
  
-   [CBitmapButton](../mfc/reference/cbitmapbutton-class.md)  
  
-   [CCheckListBox](../mfc/reference/cchecklistbox-class.md)  
  
-   [CDragListBox](../mfc/reference/cdraglistbox-class.md)  
  
##  <a name="_core_finding_information_about_windows_common_controls"></a> Finding Information About Windows Common Controls  
 The table below briefly describes each of the Windows common controls, including the control's MFC wrapper class.
