# Resizing an Entire Image (Image Editor for Icons)
### To resize an entire image using the properties window  
  
1.  Open the image whose properties you want to change.  
  
2.  In the **Width** and **Height** boxes in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window), type the dimensions that you want.  
  
     If you are increasing the size of the image, the Image editor extends the image to the right, downward, or both, and fills the new region with the current background color. The image is not stretched.  
  
     If you are decreasing the size of the image, the Image editor crops the image on the right or bottom edge, or both.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can use the Width and Height properties to resize only the entire image, not to resize a partial selection.
