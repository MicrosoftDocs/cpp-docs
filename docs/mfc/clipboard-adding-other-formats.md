# Clipboard: Adding Other Formats

This topic explains how to expand the list of supported formats, particularly for OLE support. The topic [Clipboard: Copying and Pasting Data](../mfc/clipboard-copying-and-pasting-data.md) describes the minimum implementation necessary to support copying and pasting from the Clipboard. If this is all you implement, the only formats placed on the Clipboard are **CF_METAFILEPICT**, **CF_EMBEDSOURCE**, **CF_OBJECTDESCRIPTOR**, and possibly **CF_LINKSOURCE**. Most applications will need more formats on the Clipboard than these three.

## <a name="_core_registering_custom_formats"></a> Registering Custom Formats

To create your own custom formats, follow the same procedure you would use when registering any custom Clipboard format: pass the name of the format to the **RegisterClipboardFormat** function and use its return value as the format ID.

## <a name="_core_placing_formats_on_the_clipboard"></a> Placing Formats on the Clipboard

To add more formats to those placed on the Clipboard, you must override the `OnGetClipboardData` function in the class you derived from either `COleClientItem` or `COleServerItem` (depending on whether the data to be copied is native). In this function, you should use the following procedure.

#### To place formats on the Clipboard

1. Create a `COleDataSource` object.

1. Pass this data source to a function that adds your native data formats to the list of supported formats by calling `COleDataSource::CacheGlobalData`.

1. Add standard formats by calling `COleDataSource::CacheGlobalData` for each standard format you want to support.

This technique is used in the MFC OLE sample program [HIERSVR](../overview/visual-cpp-samples.md) (examine the `OnGetClipboardData` member function of the **CServerItem** class). The only difference in this sample is that step three is not implemented because HIERSVR supports no other standard formats.
