# Adding, Editing, or Deleting Controls
Using the Dialog editor, you can add, resize, edit, and delete controls in dialog boxes. You can also edit the properties of a control, such as its ID, or whether it is initially visible at run time.  
  
 You can use the shortcut menu in the Dialog editor to quickly add registered ActiveX controls to a dialog box, and you can add ActiveX controls to the Toolbox for quick access (for more information, see [Customize Toolbox Dialog Box](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bd07835f-18a8-433e-bccc-7141f65263bb)).
