# How the Framework Calls a Handler
The following topics first examine how the framework routes commands, then examine how other messages and control notifications are sent to windows:  
  
-   [Message sending and receiving](../mfc/message-sending-and-receiving.md)  
  
-   [How noncommand messages reach their handlers](../mfc/how-noncommand-messages-reach-their-handlers.md)  
  
-   [Command routing](../mfc/command-routing.md)  
  
-   [Command Routing Illustration](../mfc/command-routing-illustration.md)  
  
-   [The OnCmdMsg Handler](../mfc/oncmdmsg-handler.md)  
  
-   [Overriding the Standard Command Routing](../mfc/overriding-the-standard-command-routing.md)
