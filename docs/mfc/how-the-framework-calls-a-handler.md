# How the Framework Calls a Handler

The following topics first examine how the framework routes commands, then examine how other messages and control notifications are sent to windows:

- [How noncommand messages reach their handlers](../mfc/how-noncommand-messages-reach-their-handlers.md)

- [Command routing](../mfc/command-routing.md)

- [Command Routing Illustration](../mfc/command-routing-illustration.md)

- [The OnCmdMsg Handler](../mfc/oncmdmsg-handler.md)

- [Overriding the Standard Command Routing](../mfc/overriding-the-standard-command-routing.md)
