# Using Image Lists in a Toolbar Control
By default, the images used by the buttons in a toolbar control are stored as a single bitmap. However, you can also store button images in a set of image lists. The toolbar control object can use up to three separate image lists:  
  
-   Enabled image list   Contains images for toolbar buttons that are currently enabled.  
  
-   Disabled image list   Contains images for toolbar buttons that are currently disabled.  
  
-   Highlighted image list   Contains images for toolbar buttons that are currently highlighted. This image list is used only when the toolbar uses the TBSTYLE_FLAT style.  
  
 These image lists are used by the toolbar control when you associate them with the `CToolBarCtrl` object. This association is accomplished by making calls to [CToolBarCtrl::SetImageList](../mfc/reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md#setimagelist), [SetDisabledImageList](../mfc/reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md#setdisabledimagelist), and [SetHotImageList](../mfc/reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md#sethotimagelist).  
  
 By default, MFC uses the `CToolBar` class to implement MFC application toolbars. However, the `GetToolBarCtrl` member function can be used to retrieve the embedded `CToolBarCtrl` object. You can then make calls to `CToolBarCtrl` member functions using the returned object.  
  
 The following example demonstrates this technique by assigning an enabled (`m_ToolBarImages`) and disabled (`m_ToolBarDisabledImages`) image list to a `CToolBarCtrl` object (`m_ToolBarCtrl`).  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#35](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-image-lists-in-a-toolbar-control_1.cpp)]  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The image lists used by the toolbar object must be permanent objects. For this reason, they are commonly data members of an MFC class; in this example, the main frame window class.  
  
 Once the image lists are associated with the `CToolBarCtrl` object, the framework automatically displays the proper button image.
