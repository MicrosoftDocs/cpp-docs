# Type-Safe Access to Controls Without Code Wizards
The first approach to creating type-safe access to controls uses an inline member function to cast the return type of class `CWnd`'s `GetDlgItem` member function to the appropriate C++ control type, as in this example:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#50](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/type-safe-access-to-controls-without-code-wizards_1.cpp)]  
  
 You can then use this member function to access the control in a type-safe manner with code similar to the following:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#51](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/type-safe-access-to-controls-without-code-wizards_2.cpp)]
