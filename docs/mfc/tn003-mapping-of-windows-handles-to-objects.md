# TN003: Mapping of Windows Handles to Objects
This note describes the MFC routines that support mapping Windows object handles to C++ objects.  
  
## The Problem  
 Windows objects are typically represented by various [HANDLE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa383751) objects The MFC classes wrap Windows object handles with C++ objects. The handle wrapping functions of the MFC class library let you find the C++ object that is wrapping the Windows object that has a particular handle. However, sometimes an object does not have a C++ wrapper object and at these times the system creates a temporary object to act as the C++ wrapper.  
  
 The Windows objects that use handle maps are as follows:  
  
-   HWND ([CWnd](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md) and `CWnd`-derived classes)  
  
-   HDC ([CDC](../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md) and `CDC`-derived classes)  
  
-   HMENU ([CMenu](../mfc/reference/cmenu-class.md))  
  
-   HPEN ([CGdiObject](../mfc/reference/cgdiobject-class.md))  
  
-   HBRUSH (`CGdiObject`)  
  
-   HFONT (`CGdiObject`)  
  
-   HBITMAP (`CGdiObject`)  
  
-   HPALETTE (`CGdiObject`)  
  
-   HRGN (`CGdiObject`)  
  
-   HIMAGELIST ([CImageList](../mfc/reference/cimagelist-class.md))  
  
-   SOCKET ([CSocket](../mfc/reference/csocket-class.md))  
  
 Given a handle to any one of these objects, you can find the MFC object that wraps the handle by calling the static method `FromHandle`. For example, given an HWND called *hWnd*, the following line will return a pointer to the `CWnd` that wraps *hWnd*:  
  
```  
CWnd::FromHandle(hWnd)  
```  
  
 If *hWnd* does not have a specific wrapper object, a temporary `CWnd` is created to wrap *hWnd*. This makes it possible to obtain a valid C++ object from any handle.  
  
 After you have a wrapper object, you can retrieve its handle from a public member variable of the wrapper class. In the case of a `CWnd`, *m_hWnd* contains the HWND for that object.  
  
## Attaching Handles to MFC Objects  
 Given a newly created handle-wrapper object and a handle to a Windows object, you can associate the two by calling the `Attach` function as in this example:  
  
```  
CWnd myWnd;  
myWnd.Attach(hWnd);
```  
  
 This makes an entry in the permanent map associating *myWnd* and *hWnd*. Calling `CWnd::FromHandle(hWnd)` will now return a pointer to *myWnd*. When *myWnd* is deleted, the destructor will automatically destroy *hWnd* by calling the Windows [DestroyWindow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632682) function. If this is not desired, *hWnd* must be detached from *myWnd* before *myWnd* is destroyed (normally when leaving the scope at which *myWnd* was defined). The `Detach` method does this.  
  
```  
myWnd.Detach();
```  
  
## More About Temporary Objects  
 Temporary objects are created whenever `FromHandle` is given a handle that does not already have a wrapper object. These temporary objects are detached from their handle and deleted by the `DeleteTempMap` functions. By default [CWinThread::OnIdle](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md#onidle) automatically calls `DeleteTempMap` for each class that supports temporary handle maps. This means that you cannot assume a pointer to a temporary object will be valid past the point of exit from the function where the pointer was obtained.  
  
## Wrapper Objects and Multiple Threads  
 Both temporary and permanent objects are maintained on a per-thread basis. That is, one thread cannot access another thread's C++ wrapper objects, regardless of whether it is temporary or permanent.  
  
 To pass these objects from one thread to another, always send them as their native `HANDLE` type. Passing a C++ wrapper object from one thread to another will often cause unexpected results.
