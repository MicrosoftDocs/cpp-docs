# Clipboard: When to Use Each Clipboard Mechanism
Follow these guidelines in using the Clipboard:  
  
-   Use the OLE Clipboard mechanism now to enable new capabilities in the future. While the standard Clipboard API will be maintained, the OLE mechanism is the future of data transfer.  
  
-   Use the OLE Clipboard mechanism if you are writing an OLE application or you want any of the OLE features, such as drag and drop.  
  
-   Use the OLE Clipboard mechanism if you are providing OLE formats.  
  
## What do you want to do  
  
-   [Use the OLE Clipboard mechanism](../mfc/clipboard-using-the-ole-clipboard-mechanism.md)  
  
-   [Use the Windows Clipboard mechanism](../mfc/clipboard-using-the-windows-clipboard.md)
