# Clipboard: When to Use Each Clipboard Mechanism

Follow these guidelines in using the Clipboard:

- Use the OLE Clipboard mechanism now to enable new capabilities in the future. While the standard Clipboard API will be maintained, the OLE mechanism is the future of data transfer.

- Use the OLE Clipboard mechanism if you are writing an OLE application or you want any of the OLE features, such as drag and drop.

- Use the OLE Clipboard mechanism if you are providing OLE formats.
