# Opening Files
In MFC, the most common way to open a file is a two-stage process.  
  
#### To open a file  
  
1.  Create the file object without specifying a path or permission flags.  
  
     You usually create a file object by declaring a [CFile](../mfc/reference/cfile-class.md) variable on the stack frame.  
  
2.  Call the [Open](../mfc/reference/cfile-class.md#open) member function for the file object, supplying a path and permission flags.  
  
     The return value for `Open` will be nonzero if the file was opened successfully or 0 if the specified file could not be opened. The `Open` member function is prototyped as follows:  
  
     `virtual BOOL Open( LPCTSTR lpszFileName, UINT nOpenFlags, CFileException* pError = NULL );`  
  
     The open flags specify which permissions, such as read-only, you want for the file. The possible flag values are defined as enumerated constants within the `CFile` class, so they are qualified with "`CFile::`" as in `CFile::modeRead`. Use the `CFile::modeCreate` flag if you want to create the file.  
  
 The following example shows how to create a new file with read/write permission (replacing any previous file with the same path):  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCFiles#1](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/codesnippet/cpp/opening-files_1.cpp)]  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This example creates and opens a file. If there are problems, the `Open` call can return a `CFileException` object in its last parameter, as shown here. The TRACE macro prints both the file name and a code indicating the reason for failure. You can call the `AfxThrowFileException` function if you require more detailed error reporting.
