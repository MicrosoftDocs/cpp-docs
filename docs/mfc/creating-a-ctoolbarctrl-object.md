# Creating a CToolBarCtrl Object

[CToolBarCtrl](reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md) objects contain several internal data structures — a list of button image bitmaps, a list of button label strings, and a list of `TBBUTTON` structures — that associate an image and/or string with the position, style, state, and command ID of the button. Each of the elements of these data structures is referred to by a zero-based index. Before you can use a `CToolBarCtrl` object, you must set up these data structures. For a list of the data structures, see [Toolbar Controls](controls-mfc.md) in the Windows SDK. The list of strings can only be used for button labels; you cannot retrieve strings from the toolbar.

To use a `CToolBarCtrl` object, you will typically follow these steps:

### To use a CToolBarCtrl object

1. Construct the [CToolBarCtrl](reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md) object.

1. Call [Create](reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md#create) to create the Windows toolbar common control and attach it to the `CToolBarCtrl` object. If you want bitmap images for buttons, add the button bitmaps to the toolbar by calling [AddBitmap](reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md#addbitmap). If you want string labels for buttons, add the strings to the toolbar by calling [AddString](reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md#addstring) and/or [AddStrings](reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md#addstrings). After calling `AddString` and/or `AddStrings`, you should call [AutoSize](reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md#autosize) in order to get the string or strings to appear.

1. Add button structures to the toolbar by calling [AddButtons](reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md#addbuttons).

1. If you want tool tips, handle **TTN_NEEDTEXT** messages in the toolbar's owner window as described in [Handling Tool Tip Notifications](handling-tool-tip-notifications.md).

1. If you want your user to be able to customize the toolbar, handle customization notification messages in the owner window as described in [Handling Customization Notifications](handling-customization-notifications.md).
