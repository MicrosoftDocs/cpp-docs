# Detaching a CWnd from Its HWND

If you need to circumvent the object-`HWND` relationship, MFC provides another `CWnd` member function, [Detach](reference/cwnd-class.md#detach), which disconnects the C++ window object from the Windows window. This prevents the destructor from destroying the Windows window when the object is destroyed.
