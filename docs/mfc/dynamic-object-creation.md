# Dynamic Object Creation

This article explains how to create an object dynamically at run time. The procedure uses run-time class information, as discussed in the article [Accessing Run-Time Class Information](accessing-run-time-class-information.md).

#### Dynamically create an object given its run-time class

1. Use the following code to dynamically create an object using the `CreateObject` function of the `CRuntimeClass`. On failure, `CreateObject` returns **NULL** instead of raising an exception:
