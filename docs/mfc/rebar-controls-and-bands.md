# Rebar Controls and Bands
The main purpose of a rebar control is to act as a container for child windows, common dialog controls, menus, toolbars, and so on. This containment is supported by the concept of a "band." Each rebar band can contain any combination of a gripper bar, a bitmap, a text label, and a child window.  
  
 Class `CReBarCtrl` has many member functions that you can use to retrieve, and manipulate, information for a specific rebar band:  
  
-   [GetBandCount](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#getbandcount) Retrieves the number of current bands in the rebar control.  
  
-   [GetBandInfo](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#getbandinfo) Initializes a **REBARBANDINFO** structure with information from the specified band. There is a corresponding [SetBandInfo](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#setbandinfo) member function.  
  
-   [GetRect](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#getrect) Retrieves the bounding rectangle of a specified band.  
  
-   [GetRowCount](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#getrowcount) Retrieves the number of band rows in a rebar control.  
  
-   [IDToIndex](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#idtoindex) Retrieves the index of a specified band.  
  
-   [GetBandBorders](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#getbandborders) Retrieves the borders of a band.  
  
 In addition to manipulation, several member functions are provided that allow you to operate on specific rebar bands.  
  
 [InsertBand](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#insertband) and [DeleteBand](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#deleteband) add and remove rebar bands. [MinimizeBand](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#minimizeband) and [MaximizeBand](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#maximizeband) affect the current size of a specific rebar band. [MoveBand](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#moveband) changes the index of a specific rebar band. [ShowBand](../mfc/reference/crebarctrl-class.md#showband) shows or hides a rebar band from the user.  
  
 The following example demonstrates adding a toolbar band (*m_wndToolBar*) to an existing rebar control (*m_wndReBar*). The band is described by initializing the `rbi` structure and then calling the `InsertBand` member function:
