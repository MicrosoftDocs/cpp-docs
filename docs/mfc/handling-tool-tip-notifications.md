# Handling Tool Tip Notifications
When you specify the **TBSTYLE_TOOLTIPS** style, the toolbar creates and manages a tool tip control. A tool tip is a small pop-up window that contains a line of text describing a toolbar button. The tool tip is hidden, appearing only when the user puts the cursor on a toolbar button and leaves it there for approximately one-half second. The tool tip is displayed near the cursor.  
  
 Before the tool tip is displayed, the **TTN_NEEDTEXT** notification message is sent to the toolbar's owner window to retrieve the descriptive text for the button. If the toolbar's owner window is a `CFrameWnd` window, tool tips are displayed without any extra effort, because `CFrameWnd` has a default handler for the **TTN_NEEDTEXT** notification. If the toolbar's owner window is not derived from `CFrameWnd`, such as a dialog box or form view, you must add an entry to your owner window's message map and provide a notification handler in the message map. The entry to your owner window's message map is as follows:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#40](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/handling-tool-tip-notifications_1.cpp)]  
  
## Remarks  
 `memberFxn`  
 The member function to be called when text is needed for this button.  
  
 Note that the id of a tool tip is always 0.  
  
 In addition to the **TTN_NEEDTEXT** notification, a tool tip control can send the following notifications to a toolbar control:  
  
|Notification|Meaning|  
|------------------|-------------|  
|**TTN_NEEDTEXTA**|Tool tip control requires ASCII text (Windows 95 only)|  
|**TTN_NEEDTEXTW**|Tool tip control requires UNICODE text (Windows NT only)|  
|**TBN_HOTITEMCHANGE**|Indicates that the hot (highlighted) item has changed.|  
|**NM_RCLICK**|Indicates the user has right-clicked a button.|  
|**TBN_DRAGOUT**|Indicates the user has clicked the button and dragged the pointer off the button. It allows an application to implement drag and drop from a toolbar button. When receiving this notification, the application will begin the drag and drop operation.|  
|**TBN_DROPDOWN**|Indicates the user has clicked a button that uses the **TBSTYLE_DROPDOWN** style.|  
|**TBN_GETOBJECT**|Indicates the user moved the pointer over a button that uses the **TBSTYLE_DROPPABLE** style.|  
  
 For an example handler function and more information about enabling tool tips, see [Tool Tips](../mfc/tool-tips-in-windows-not-derived-from-cframewnd.md).
