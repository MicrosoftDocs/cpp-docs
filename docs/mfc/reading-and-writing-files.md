# Reading and Writing Files
If you've used the C run-time library file-handling functions, MFC reading and writing operations will appear familiar. This article describes reading directly from and writing directly to a `CFile` object. You can also do buffered file I/O with the [CArchive](../mfc/reference/carchive-class.md) class.  
  
#### To read from and write to the file  
  
1.  Use the `Read` and `Write` member functions to read and write data in the file.  
  
     -or-  
  
2.  The `Seek` member function is also available for moving to a specific offset within the file.  
  
 `Read` takes a pointer to a buffer and the number of bytes to read and returns the actual number of bytes that were read. If the required number of bytes could not be read because end-of-file (EOF) is reached, the actual number of bytes read is returned. If any read error occurs, an exception is thrown. `Write` is similar to `Read`, but the number of bytes written is not returned. If a write error occurs, including not writing all the bytes specified, an exception is thrown. If you have a valid `CFile` object, you can read from it or write to it as shown in the following example:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCFiles#2](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/codesnippet/cpp/reading-and-writing-files_1.cpp)]  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You should normally carry out input/output operations within a **try**/**catch** exception handling block. For more information, see [Exception Handling (MFC)](../mfc/exception-handling-in-mfc.md).
