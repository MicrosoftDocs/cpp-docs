# The CCmdUI Class
When it routes an update command to its handler, the framework passes the handler a pointer to a `CCmdUI` object (or to an object of a `CCmdUI`-derived class). This object represents the menu item or toolbar button or other user-interface object that generated the command. The update handler calls member functions of the `CCmdUI` structure through the pointer to update the user-interface object. For example, here is an update handler for the Clear All menu item:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#3](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/the-ccmdui-class_1.cpp)]  
  
 This handler calls the **Enable** member function of an object with access to the menu item. **Enable** makes the item available for use.
