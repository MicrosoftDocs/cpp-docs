# Using Frame Windows

The MFC framework creates document frame windows — and their views and documents — as part of its implementation of the New and Open commands on the File menu. Because the framework does most of the frame-window work for you, you play only a small role in creating, using, and destroying those windows. You can, however, explicitly create your own frame windows and child windows for special purposes.
