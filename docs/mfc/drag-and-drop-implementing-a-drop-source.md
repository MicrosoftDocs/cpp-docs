# Drag and Drop: Implementing a Drop Source
This article explains how to get your application to provide data to a drag-and-drop operation.  
  
 Basic implementation of a drop source is relatively simple. The first step is to determine what events begin a drag operation. Recommended user interface guidelines define the beginning of a drag operation as the selection of data and a **WM_LBUTTONDOWN** event occurring on a point inside the selected data. The MFC OLE samples [OCLIENT](../visual-cpp-samples.md) and [HIERSVR](../visual-cpp-samples.md) follow these guidelines.  
  
 If your application is a container and the selected data is a linked or an embedded object of type `COleClientItem`, call its `DoDragDrop` member function. Otherwise, construct a `COleDataSource` object, initialize it with the selection, and call the data source object's `DoDragDrop` member function. If your application is a server, use `COleServerItem::DoDragDrop`. For information about customizing standard drag-and-drop behavior, see the article [Drag and Drop: Customizing](../mfc/drag-and-drop-customizing.md).  
  
 If `DoDragDrop` returns **DROPEFFECT_MOVE**, delete the source data from the source document immediately. No other return value from `DoDragDrop` has any effect on a drop source.
