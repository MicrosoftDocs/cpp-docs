# Using an Unclipped Device Context
If you are absolutely certain that your control does not paint outside its client rectangle, you can realize a small but detectable speed gain by disabling the call to `IntersectClipRect` that is made by `COleControl`. To do this, remove the **clipPaintDC** flag from the set of flags returned by [COleControl::GetControlFlags](../mfc/reference/colecontrol-class.md#colecontrol__getcontrolflags). For example:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_AxOpt#5](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-an-unclipped-device-context_1.cpp)]  
[!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_AxOpt#14](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-an-unclipped-device-context_2.cpp)]  
[!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_AxOpt#7](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-an-unclipped-device-context_3.cpp)]  
  
 The code to remove this flag is automatically generated if you select the **Unclipped Device Context** option on the [Control Settings](../mfc/reference/control-settings-mfc-activex-control-wizard.md) page, when creating your control with the MFC ActiveX Control Wizard.  
  
 If you are using windowless activation, this optimization has no effect.
