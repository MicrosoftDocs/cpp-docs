# Window Procedure Entry Points

To protect MFC window procedures, a module static links with a special window procedure implementation. The linkage occurs automatically when the module is linked with MFC. This window procedure uses the AFX_MANAGE_STATE macro to properly set the effective module state, then it calls `AfxWndProc`, which in turn delegates to the `WindowProc` member function of the appropriate `CWnd`-derived object.
