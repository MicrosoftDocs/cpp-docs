# Methods of Creating a Toolbar
MFC provides two classes to create toolbars: [CToolBar](../mfc/reference/ctoolbar-class.md) and [CToolBarCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md) (which wraps the Windows common control API). `CToolBar` provides all of the functionality of the toolbar common control, and it handles many of the required common control settings and structures for you; however, your resulting executable usually will be larger than that created by using `CToolBarCtrl`.  
  
 `CToolBarCtrl` usually results in a smaller executable, and you may prefer to use `CToolBarCtrl` if you do not intend to integrate the toolbar into the MFC architecture. If you plan to use `CToolBarCtrl` and integrate the toolbar into the MFC architecture, you must take additional care to communicate toolbar control manipulations to MFC. This communication is not difficult; however, it is additional work that is unneeded when you use `CToolBar`.  
  
 Visual C++ provides two ways to take advantage of the toolbar common control.  
  
-   Create the toolbar using `CToolBar`, and then call [CToolBar::GetToolBarCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctoolbar-class.md#gettoolbarctrl) to get access to the `CToolBarCtrl` member functions.  
  
-   Create the toolbar using [CToolBarCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctoolbarctrl-class.md)'s constructor.  
  
 Either method will give you access to the member functions of the toolbar control. When you call `CToolBar::GetToolBarCtrl`, it returns a reference to a `CToolBarCtrl` object so you can use either set of member functions. See [CToolBar](../mfc/reference/ctoolbar-class.md) for information on constructing and creating a toolbar using `CToolBar`.
