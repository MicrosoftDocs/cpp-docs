# How to: Add Ribbon Controls and Event Handlers

Ribbon controls are elements, such as buttons and combo boxes, that you add to panels. Panels are areas of the ribbon bar that display a group of related controls.

In this topic, you will open the Ribbon Designer, add a button, and then link an event that displays "Hello World".

### To open the Ribbon Designer

1. In Visual Studio, on the **View** menu, click **Resource View**.

1. In **Resource View**, double-click the ribbon resource to display it on the design surface.

### To add a Button and an Event Handler

1. From the **Toolbar**, click **Button** and drag it on to a panel in the design surface.

1. Right-click the button, and click **Add Event Handler**.

1. In the **Event Handler Wizard**, confirm the default settings and click **Add and Edit**. For more information, see [Event Handler Wizard](../ide/event-handler-wizard.md).

1. In the code editor, add the following code into the handler function:

```
    MessageBox((LPCTSTR)L"Hello World");
```
