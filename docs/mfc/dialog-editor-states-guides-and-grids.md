# Dialog Editor States (Guides and Grids)
You can arrange controls on dialog boxes with the Dialog editor in one of three different states:  
  
-   With the guides and margins on (default setting)  
  
-   With the layout grid on  
  
-   Without any snapping or alignment features  
  
 The [Dialog Editor Toolbar](../mfc/showing-or-hiding-the-dialog-editor-toolbar.md) contains buttons that control the state. To change the state, click the appropriate icon. You can also change states by using the **Guide Settings** command on the **Format** menu.
