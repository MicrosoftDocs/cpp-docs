# Scrolling, Arranging, Sorting, and Finding in List Controls
List controls ([CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md)) are scrollable by default. For more information, see [Scroll Position](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774736) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] and the [Scroll](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#clistctrl__scroll) member function.  
  
 You can call `CListCtrl` member functions to arrange list items in the control, sort items, and find particular items. For more information, see [Arranging, Sorting, and Finding](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774736) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../atl/includes/winsdk_md.md)] and the [CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md) members [Arrange](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#clistctrl__arrange), [SortItems](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#clistctrl__sortitems), and [FindItem](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md#clistctrl__finditem).
