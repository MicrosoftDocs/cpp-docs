# Working with a Header Control

The easy way to use a header control ([CHeaderCtrl](../mfc/reference/cheaderctrl-class.md)) is in conjunction with a list control; see [Using CListCtrl](../mfc/using-clistctrl.md) later in this topic family. You can also use a header control by itself. MFC calls `InitCommonControls` for you. The key tasks are as follows:

- [Creating the header control](../mfc/creating-the-header-control.md)

- [Adding items to the header control](../mfc/adding-items-to-the-header-control.md)

- [Ordering items in the header control](../mfc/ordering-items-in-the-header-control.md)

- [Processing header-control notifications](../mfc/processing-header-control-notifications.md)

If the header control object is embedded in a parent view or dialog class, the control is destroyed when the parent is destroyed.
