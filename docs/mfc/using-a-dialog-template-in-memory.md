# Using a Dialog Template in Memory

Instead of using the methods given in the [Dialog Creation table](../mfc/creating-a-dialog-class-with-code-wizards.md), you can create either kind of dialog box indirectly from a dialog template in memory. For more information, see class [CDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md) in the *MFC Reference*.
