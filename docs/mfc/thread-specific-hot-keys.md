# Thread-Specific Hot Keys
An application sets a thread-specific hot key ([CHotKeyCtrl](../mfc/reference/chotkeyctrl-class.md)) by using the Windows `RegisterHotKey` function. When the user presses a thread-specific hot key, Windows posts a [WM_HOTKEY](/windows/desktop/inputdev/wm-hotkey) message to the beginning of a particular thread's message queue. The WM_HOTKEY message contains the virtual key code, shift state, and user-defined ID of the specific hot key that was pressed. For a list of standard virtual key codes, see Winuser.h. For more information on this method, see [RegisterHotKey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646309).  
  
 Note that the shift state flags used in the call to `RegisterHotKey` are not the same as those returned by the [GetHotKey](../mfc/reference/chotkeyctrl-class.md#gethotkey) member function; you'll have to translate these flags before calling `RegisterHotKey`.
