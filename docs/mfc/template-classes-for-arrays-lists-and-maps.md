# Template Classes for Arrays, Lists, and Maps

These collection classes are templates whose parameters determine the types of the objects stored in the aggregates. The `CArray`, `CMap`, and `CList` classes use global helper functions that must usually be customized. For more information about these helper functions, see [Collection Class Helpers](../mfc/reference/collection-class-helpers.md). The typed pointer classes are wrappers for other classes in the class library. By using these wrappers, you enlist the compiler's type-checking to help you avoid errors. For more information on using these classes, see [Collections](../mfc/collections.md).

These classes provide templates you can use to create arrays, lists, and maps using any type you like.

[CArray](../mfc/reference/carray-class.md)<br/>
Template class for making arrays of arbitrary types.

[CList](../mfc/reference/clist-class.md)<br/>
Template class for making lists of arbitrary types.

[CMap](../mfc/reference/cmap-class.md)<br/>
Template class for making maps with arbitrary key and value types.

[CTypedPtrArray](../mfc/reference/ctypedptrarray-class.md)<br/>
Template class for type-safe arrays of pointers.

[CTypedPtrList](../mfc/reference/ctypedptrlist-class.md)<br/>
Template class for type-safe lists of pointers.

[CTypedPtrMap](../mfc/reference/ctypedptrmap-class.md)<br/>
Template class for type-safe maps with pointers.
