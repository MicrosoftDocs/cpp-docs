# Using the Dialog Editor to Add Controls

When you create your dialog-template resource with the [dialog editor](../windows/dialog-editor.md), you drag controls from a controls palette and drop them into the dialog box. This adds the specifications for that control type to the dialog-template resource. When you construct a dialog object and call its `Create` or `DoModal` member function, the framework creates a Windows control and places it in the dialog window on screen.

You can instead [create controls by hand](../mfc/adding-controls-by-hand.md) if you want. This is more work.
