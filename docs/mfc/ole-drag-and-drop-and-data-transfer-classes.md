# OLE Drag-and-Drop and Data Transfer Classes
These classes are used in OLE data transfers. They allow data to be transferred between applications by using the Clipboard or through drag and drop.  
  
 [COleDropSource](../mfc/reference/coledropsource-class.md)  
 Controls the drag-and-drop operation from start to finish. This class determines when the drag operation starts and when it ends. It also displays cursor feedback during the drag-and-drop operation.  
  
 [COleDataSource](../mfc/reference/coledatasource-class.md)  
 Used when an application provides data for a data transfer. `COleDataSource` could be viewed as an object-oriented Clipboard object.  
  
 [COleDropTarget](../mfc/reference/coledroptarget-class.md)  
 Represents the target of a drag-and-drop operation. A `COleDropTarget` object corresponds to a window on screen. It determines whether to accept any data dropped onto it and implements the actual drop operation.  
  
 [COleDataObject](../mfc/reference/coledataobject-class.md)  
 Used as the receiver side to `COleDataSource`. `COleDataObject` objects provide access to the data stored by a `COleDataSource` object.
