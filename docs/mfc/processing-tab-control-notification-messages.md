# Processing Tab Control Notification Messages

As users click tabs or buttons, the tab control ([CTabCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctabctrl-class.md)) sends notification messages to its parent window. Handle these messages if you want to do something in response. For example, when the user clicks a tab, you may want to preset control data on the page prior to displaying it.

Process WM_NOTIFY messages from the tab control in your view or dialog class. Use the [Class Wizard](reference/mfc-class-wizard.md) to create an [OnChildNotify](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#onchildnotify) handler function with a switch statement based on which notification message is being handled. For a list of the notifications a tab control can send to its parent window, see the **Notifications** section of [Tab Control Reference](/windows/win32/controls/tab-control-reference) in the Windows SDK.
