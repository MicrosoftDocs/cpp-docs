# Creating Modal Dialog Boxes

To create a modal dialog box, call either of the two public constructors declared in [CDialog](reference/cdialog-class.md). Next, call the dialog object's [DoModal](reference/cdialog-class.md#domodal) member function to display the dialog box and manage interaction with it until the user chooses OK or Cancel. This management by `DoModal` is what makes the dialog box modal. For modal dialog boxes, `DoModal` loads the dialog resource.
