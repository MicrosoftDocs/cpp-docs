# File I/O Classes
These classes provide an interface to traditional disk files, in-memory files, Active streams, and Windows sockets. All of the classes derived from `CFile` can be used with a `CArchive` object to perform serialization.  
  
 Use the following classes, particularly `CArchive` and `CFile`, if you write your own input/output processing. Normally you do not need to derive from these classes. If you use the application framework, the default implementations of the **Open** and **Save** commands on the **File** menu will handle file I/O (using class `CArchive`), as long as you override your document's `Serialize` function to supply details about how a document serializes its contents. For more information about the file classes and serialization, see the article [Files in MFC](../mfc/files-in-mfc.md) and the article [Serialization](../mfc/serialization-in-mfc.md).  
  
 [CFile](../mfc/reference/cfile-class.md)  
 Provides a file interface to binary disk files.  
  
 [CStdioFile](../mfc/reference/cstdiofile-class.md)  
 Provides a `CFile` interface to buffered stream disk files, usually in text mode.  
  
 [CMemFile](../mfc/reference/cmemfile-class.md)  
 Provides a `CFile` interface to in-memory files.  
  
 [CSharedFile](../mfc/reference/csharedfile-class.md)  
 Provides a `CFile` interface to shared in-memory files.  
  
 [COleStreamFile](../mfc/reference/colestreamfile-class.md)  
 Uses the COM `IStream` interface to provide `CFile` access to compound files.  
  
 [CSocketFile](../mfc/reference/csocketfile-class.md)  
 Provides a `CFile` interface to a Windows Socket.  
  
## Related Classes  
 [CArchive](../mfc/reference/carchive-class.md)  
 Cooperates with a `CFile` object to implement persistent storage for objects through serialization (see [CObject::Serialize](../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md#serialize)).  
  
 [CArchiveException](../mfc/reference/carchiveexception-class.md)  
 An archive exception.  
  
 [CFileException](../mfc/reference/cfileexception-class.md)  
 A file-oriented exception.  
  
 [CFileDialog](../mfc/reference/cfiledialog-class.md)  
 Provides a standard dialog box for opening or saving a file.  
  
 [CRecentFileList](../mfc/reference/crecentfilelist-class.md)  
 Maintains the most recently used (MRU) file list.
