# Using CHeaderCtrl

Use a header control, represented by class [CHeaderCtrl](../mfc/reference/cheaderctrl-class.md), to display column headers for a columnar list. For example, a header control would be useful for implementing column controls in a spreadsheet.

The header control is usually divided into parts, called "header items," each bearing a title for the associated column of text or numbers. Depending on the styles you set, you can provide a number of direct ways for users to manipulate the header items.

> [!NOTE]
> [CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md) provides an embedded header control, and [CListView](../mfc/reference/clistview-class.md) encapsulates `CListCtrl` in an MFC class. In general, think of using `CHeaderCtrl` to label lists that you intend to draw yourself.
