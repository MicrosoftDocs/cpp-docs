# Using a Dialog Bar with a Rebar Control
As mentioned in [Rebar Controls and Bands](../mfc/rebar-controls-and-bands.md), each band can contain only one child window (or control). This might be a limitation if you want to have more than one child window per band. A convenient workaround is to create a dialog bar resource with multiple controls and then add a rebar band (containing the dialog bar) to the rebar control.  
  
 Normally, if you wanted the dialog bar band to appear transparent, you would set the WS_EX_TRANSPARENT extended style for the dialog bar object. However, because WS_EX_TRANSPARENT has some issues with properly painting the background of a dialog bar, you will need to do a little extra work to achieve the desired effect.  
  
 The following procedure details the steps necessary to achieve transparency without using the WS_EX_TRANSPARENT extended style.  
  
### To implement a transparent dialog bar in a rebar band  
  
1.  Using the [Add Class dialog box](../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-class.md), add a new class (for example, `CMyDlgBar`) that implements your dialog bar object.  
  
2.  Add a handler for the WM_ERASEBKGND message.  
  
3.  In the new handler, modify the existing code to match the following example:  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#29](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-a-dialog-bar-with-a-rebar-control_1.cpp)]  
  
4.  Add a handler for the WM_MOVE message.  
  
5.  In the new handler, modify the existing code to match the following example:  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCControlLadenDialog#30](../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/using-a-dialog-bar-with-a-rebar-control_2.cpp)]  
  
 The new handlers simulate the transparency of the dialog bar by forwarding the WM_ERASEBKGND message to the parent window and forcing a repaint every time the dialog bar object is moved.
