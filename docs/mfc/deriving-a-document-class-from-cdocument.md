# Deriving a Document Class from CDocument

Documents contain and manage your application's data. To use the MFC Application Wizard-supplied document class, you must do the following:

- Derive a class from `CDocument` for each type of document.

- Add member variables to store each document's data.

- Override `CDocument`'s `Serialize` member function in your document class. `Serialize` writes and reads the document's data to and from disk.

## Other Document Functions Often Overridden

You may also want to override other `CDocument` member functions. In particular, you will often need to override [OnNewDocument](reference/cdocument-class.md#onnewdocument) and [OnOpenDocument](reference/cdocument-class.md#onopendocument) to initialize the document's data members and [DeleteContents](reference/cdocument-class.md#deletecontents) to destroy dynamically allocated data. For information about overridable members, see class [CDocument](reference/cdocument-class.md) in the *MFC Reference*.
