# Word Breaks in Rich Edit Controls
A rich edit control ([CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md)) calls a function called a "word break procedure" to find breaks between words and to determine where it can break lines. The control uses this information when performing word-wrap operations and when processing the CTRL+LEFT and CTRL+RIGHT key combinations. An application can send messages to a rich edit control to replace the default word-break procedure, to retrieve word-break information, and to determine what line a given character falls on.
