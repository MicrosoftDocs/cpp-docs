# TN032: MFC Exception Mechanism
Previous versions of Visual C++ did not support the standard C++ exception mechanism, and MFC provided macros **TRY/CATCH/THROW** that were used instead. This version of Visual C++ fully supports C++ exceptions. This note covered some of the advanced implementation details of the previous macros including how to automatically cleanup stack based objects. Because C++ exceptions support stack unwinding by default, this technical note is no longer necessary.  
  
 Refer to [Exceptions: Using MFC Macros and C++ Exceptions](../mfc/exceptions-using-mfc-macros-and-cpp-exceptions.md) for more information on the differences between the MFC macros and the new C++ keywords.
