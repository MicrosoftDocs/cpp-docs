# How to: Load a Ribbon Resource from an MFC Application
To use the ribbon resource in your application, modify the application to load the ribbon resource.  
  
### To load a ribbon resource  
  
1.  Declare the `Ribbon Control` object in the `CMainFrame` class.  
  
 ```  
    CMFCRibbonBar m_wndRibbonBar;   
 ```  
  
2.  In `CMainFrame::OnCreate`, create and initialize the Ribbon Control.  
  
 ```  
    if (!m_wndRibbonBar.Create (this))  
 {  
    return -1;  
 }  
 
    if (!m_wndRibbonBar.LoadFromResource(IDR_RIBBON))  
 {  
    return -1;  
 }  
 ```
