# Cleaning Up Documents and Views
When a document is closing, the framework first calls its [DeleteContents](../mfc/reference/cdocument-class.md#deletecontents) member function. If you allocated any memory on the heap during the course of the document's operation, `DeleteContents` is the best place to deallocate it.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You should not deallocate document data in the document's destructor. In the case of an SDI application, the document object might be reused.  
  
 You can override a view's destructor to deallocate any memory you allocated on the heap.
