# Cropping or Extending an Entire Image (Image Editor for Icons)
The following procedures shows you how to crop or extend an entire image.  
  
### To crop or extend an entire image  
  
1.  Select the entire image.  
  
     If part of the image is currently selected, and you want to select the entire image, click anywhere on the image outside the current selection border.  
  
2.  Drag a sizing handle until the image is the desired size.  
  
 Normally, the Image editor crops or enlarges an image when you resize it by moving a sizing handle. If you hold down the SHIFT key as you move a sizing handle, the Image editor [shrinks or stretches](../mfc/shrinking-or-stretching-an-entire-image-image-editor-for-icons.md) the image.
