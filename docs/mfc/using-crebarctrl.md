# Using CReBarCtrl
A rebar control acts as a container for child windows. These child windows, often other controls, are assigned to a rebar control band. A rebar control can contain one or more bands, with each band having any combination of a gripper bar, a bitmap, a text label, and a child window. However, bands cannot contain more than one child window.  
  
 The following illustration shows a rebar control that has two bands. One contains a gripper bar, a text label ("Address"), and a combo box child window. The other band contains a gripper bar, a text label, and a flat toolbar (implemented with a child window).
