# Document Template Creation

When creating a new document in response to a **New** or **Open** command from the **File** menu, the document template also creates a new frame window through which to view the document.

The document-template constructor specifies what types of documents, windows, and views the template will be able to create. This is determined by the arguments you pass to the document-template constructor. The following code illustrates creation of a [CMultiDocTemplate](reference/cmultidoctemplate-class.md) for a sample application:

[!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#7](codesnippet/cpp/document-template-creation_1.cpp)]

The pointer to a new `CMultiDocTemplate` object is used as an argument to [AddDocTemplate](reference/cwinapp-class.md#adddoctemplate). Arguments to the `CMultiDocTemplate` constructor include the resource ID associated with the document type's menus and accelerators, and three uses of the [RUNTIME_CLASS](reference/run-time-object-model-services.md#runtime_class) macro. `RUNTIME_CLASS` returns the [CRuntimeClass](reference/cruntimeclass-structure.md) object for the C++ class named as its argument. The three `CRuntimeClass` objects passed to the document-template constructor supply the information needed to create new objects of the specified classes during the document creation process. The example shows creation of a document template that creates `CMyDoc` objects with `CMyView` objects attached. The views are framed by custom MDI child frame windows `CChildFrame`.
