# Working with a Tab Control
The easiest way to use a tab control ([CTabCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctabctrl-class.md)) is by adding it to a dialog template resource with the dialog editor. You can also use a tab control by itself. MFC calls `InitCommonControls` for you. The key tasks are as follows:  
  
-   [Creating the tab control](../mfc/creating-the-tab-control.md)  
  
-   [Adding tabs to a tab control](../mfc/adding-tabs-to-a-tab-control.md)  
  
-   [Processing tab control notification messages](../mfc/processing-tab-control-notification-messages.md)  
  
 If the tab control object is embedded in a parent view or dialog class, the control is destroyed when the parent is destroyed.
