# Trackers
The [CRectTracker](../mfc/reference/crecttracker-class.md) class provides a user interface between rectangular items in your application and your user by providing a variety of display styles. These styles include solid, hatched, or dashed borders; a hatched pattern that covers the item; and resize handles that can be located on the outside or inside of a border. Trackers are often used in conjunction with OLE items, that is, objects derived from `COleClientItem`. The tracker rectangles give visual cues on the current status of the item.  
  
 The MFC OLE sample [OCLIENT](../visual-cpp-samples.md) demonstrates a common interface using trackers and OLE client items from the viewpoint of a container application. For a demonstration of the different styles and abilities of a tracker object, see the MFC general sample [TRACKER](../visual-cpp-samples.md).  
  
 For more information on implementing trackers in your OLE application, see [Trackers: Implementing Trackers in Your OLE Application](../mfc/trackers-implementing-trackers-in-your-ole-application.md)
