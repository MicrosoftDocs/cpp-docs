# Using CListCtrl
Use a list control to display any arrangement of icons with labels, as in File Explorer, or columnar lists of text, with or without icons. For a description of the four possible "views" (not to be confused with MFC views) you can have in a list control — icon view, small icon view, list view, and report view — see Views in the [CListCtrl](../mfc/reference/clistctrl-class.md) class overview.  
  
 In some views, users can drag icons to different positions or edit icon labels. For example, see the right-hand pane in File Explorer, which uses a list control in a nondialog window. You can experiment with the available views in Explorer's View menu.  
  
 For related information, see [About List-View Controls](/windows/desktop/Controls/list-view-controls-overview) in the Windows SDK.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Windows SDK refers to list controls as "list view controls." This usage of "view" does not refer to MFC view classes, particularly `CListView`. For more information, see [List Control and List View](../mfc/list-control-and-list-view.md).
