# When to Initialize CWnd Objects
You cannot create your own child windows or call any Windows API functions in the constructor of a `CWnd`-derived object. This is because the `HWND` for the `CWnd` object has not been created yet. Most Windows-specific initialization, such as adding child windows, must be done in an [OnCreate](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#oncreate) message handler.
