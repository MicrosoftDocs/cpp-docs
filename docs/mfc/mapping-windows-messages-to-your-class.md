# Mapping Windows Messages to Your Class

If you need your dialog box to handle Windows messages, override the appropriate handler functions. To do so, choose the **Class View** tab in **Solution Explorer**, right click on the class that represents the dialog box, and choose [Class Wizard](reference/mfc-class-wizard.md). Use the wizard to [map the messages](reference/mapping-messages-to-functions.md) to the dialog class. This writes a message-map entry for each message and adds the message-handler member functions to the class. Use the code editor to write code in the message handlers.

You can also override member functions of [CDialog](reference/cdialog-class.md) and its base classes, especially [CWnd](reference/cwnd-class.md).
