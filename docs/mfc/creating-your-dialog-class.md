# Creating Your Dialog Class
For each dialog box in your program, create a new dialog class to work with the dialog resource.  
  
 [Adding a Class](../ide/adding-a-class-visual-cpp.md) explains how to create a new dialog class. When you create a dialog class with the Add Class Wizard, it writes the following items in the .H and .CPP files you specify:  
  
 In the .H file:  
  
-   A class declaration for the dialog class. The class is derived from [CDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md).  
  
 In the .CPP file:  
  
-   A message map for the class.  
  
-   A standard constructor for the dialog box.  
  
-   An override of the [DoDataExchange](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#dodataexchange) member function. Edit this function. It is used for dialog data exchange and validation capabilities as described later in [Dialog data exchange and validation](../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md).
