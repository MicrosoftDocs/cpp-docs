# Allocating and Deallocating Window Memory

Do not use the C++ **`delete`** operator to destroy a frame window or view. Instead, call the `CWnd` member function `DestroyWindow`. Frame windows, therefore, should be allocated on the heap with operator **`new`**. Be careful when allocating frame windows on the stack frame or globally. Other windows should be allocated on the stack frame whenever possible.
