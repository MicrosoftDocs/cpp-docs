# Output (Device Context) Classes

These classes encapsulate the different types of device contexts available in Windows.

Most of the following classes encapsulate a handle to a Windows device context. A device context is a Windows object that contains information about the drawing attributes of a device such as a display or a printer. All drawing calls are made through a device-context object. Additional classes derived from `CDC` encapsulate specialized device-context functionality, including support for Windows metafiles.

[CDC](../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md)<br/>
The base class for device contexts. Used directly for accessing the whole display and for accessing nondisplay contexts such as printers.

[CPaintDC](../mfc/reference/cpaintdc-class.md)<br/>
A display context used in `OnPaint` member functions of windows. Automatically calls `BeginPaint` on construction and `EndPaint` on destruction.

[CClientDC](../mfc/reference/cclientdc-class.md)<br/>
A display context for client areas of windows. Used, for example, to draw in an immediate response to mouse events.

[CWindowDC](../mfc/reference/cwindowdc-class.md)<br/>
A display context for entire windows, including both the client and nonclient areas.

[CMetaFileDC](../mfc/reference/cmetafiledc-class.md)<br/>
A device context for Windows metafiles. A Windows metafile contains a sequence of graphics device interface (GDI) commands that can be replayed to create an image. Calls made to the member functions of a `CMetaFileDC` are recorded in a metafile.

## Related Classes

[CPoint](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md)<br/>
Holds coordinate (x, y) pairs.

[CSize](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md)<br/>
Holds distance, relative positions, or paired values.

[CRect](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md)<br/>
Holds coordinates of rectangular areas.

[CRgn](../mfc/reference/crgn-class.md)<br/>
Encapsulates a GDI region for manipulating an elliptical, polygonal, or irregular area within a window. Used in conjunction with the clipping member functions in class `CDC`.

[CRectTracker](../mfc/reference/crecttracker-class.md)<br/>
Displays and handles the user interface for resizing and moving rectangular objects.

[CColorDialog](../mfc/reference/ccolordialog-class.md)<br/>
Provides a standard dialog box for selecting a color.

[CFontDialog](../mfc/reference/cfontdialog-class.md)<br/>
Provides a standard dialog box for selecting a font.

[CPrintDialog](../mfc/reference/cprintdialog-class.md)<br/>
Provides a standard dialog box for printing a file.
