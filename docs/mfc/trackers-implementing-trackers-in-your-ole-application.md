# Trackers: Implementing Trackers in Your OLE Application
Trackers provide a graphical interface to enable users to interact with OLE client items. By using different tracker styles, OLE client items can be displayed with hatched borders, resize handles, or a variety of other visual effects. This article describes:  
  
-   [How to Implement Tracking in Your Code](../mfc/how-to-implement-tracking-in-your-code.md).  
  
-   [Rubber-Banding and Trackers](../mfc/rubber-banding-and-trackers.md).  
  
 The article also covers the use of styles with trackers. In addition, it makes several references to the MFC OLE sample [OCLIENT](../visual-cpp-samples.md).
