# OnCmdMsg Handler
To accomplish the routing of commands, each command target calls the `OnCmdMsg` member function of the next command target in the sequence. Command targets use `OnCmdMsg` to determine whether they can handle a command and to route it to another command target if they cannot handle it.  
  
 Each command-target class may override the `OnCmdMsg` member function. The overrides let each class route commands to a particular next target. A frame window, for example, always routes commands to its current child window or view, as shown in the table [Standard Command Route](../mfc/command-routing.md).  
  
 The default `CCmdTarget` implementation of `OnCmdMsg` uses the message map of the command-target class to search for a handler function for each command message it receives â€” in the same way that standard messages are searched. If it finds a match, it calls the handler. Message-map searching is explained in [How the Framework Searches Message Maps](../mfc/how-the-framework-searches-message-maps.md).
