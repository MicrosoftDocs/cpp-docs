# Using a Common Control as a Child Window
Any of the Windows common controls can be used as a child window of any other window. The following procedure describes how to create a common control dynamically and then work with it.  
  
### To use a common control as a child window  
  
1.  Define the control in the related class or handler.  
  
2.  Use the control's override of the [CWnd::Create](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#create) method to create the Windows control.  
  
3.  After the control has been created (as early as the `OnCreate` handler if you subclass the control), you can manipulate the control using its member functions. See the descriptions of individual controls at [Controls](../mfc/controls-mfc.md) for details on methods.  
  
4.  When you are finished with the control, use [CWnd::DestroyWindow](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#destroywindow) to destroy the control.
