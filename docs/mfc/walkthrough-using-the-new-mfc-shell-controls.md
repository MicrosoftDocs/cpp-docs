# Walkthrough: Using the New MFC Shell Controls

In this walkthrough, you'll create an application that resembles File Explorer. You'll create a window that has two panes. The left pane will hold a [CMFCShellTreeCtrl](../mfc/reference/cmfcshelltreectrl-class.md) object that displays your Desktop in a hierarchical view. The right pane will hold a [CMFCShellListCtrl](../mfc/reference/cmfcshelllistctrl-class.md) that shows the files in the folder that is selected in the left pane.

## Prerequisites

This walkthrough assumes that you have set up Visual Studio to use **General Development Settings**. If you're using a different development setting, some Visual Studio windows that we use in this walkthrough might not be displayed by default.

### To create a new MFC application by using the MFC Application Wizard

1. Use the **MFC Application Wizard** to create a new MFC application. To run the wizard, from the **File** menu select **New**, and then select **Project**. The **New Project** dialog box will be displayed.

1. In the **New Project** dialog box, expand the **Visual C++** node in the **Project types** pane and select **MFC**. Then, in the **Templates** pane, select **MFC Application**. Type a name for the project, such as `MFCShellControls` and click **OK**. After **MFC Application Wizard** displays, use the following options:

    1. On the **Application Type** pane, under **Application type**, clear the **Tabbed documents** option. Next, select **Single document** and select **Document/View architecture support**. Under **Project style**, select **Visual Studio**, and from the **Visual style and colors** drop down list select **Office 2007 (Blue theme)**.

    1. On the **Compound Document Support** pane, select **None**.

    1. Don't make any changes to the **Document Template Strings** pane.

    1. On the **Database Support** pane (Visual Studio 2015 and older), select **None** because the application doesn't use a database.

    1. On the **User Interface Features** pane, make sure the **Use a menu bar and toolbar** option is selected. Leave all other options as they are.

    1. On the **Advanced Features** pane, under **Advanced features**, select only **ActiveX controls** and **Common Control Manifest**. Under **Advanced frame panes**, select only the **Navigation pane** option. It will cause the wizard to create the pane to the left of the window with a `CMFCShellTreeCtrl` already embedded.

    1. We aren't going to make any changes to the **Generated Classes** pane, so click **Finish** to create your new MFC project.

1. Verify that the application was created successfully by building and running it. To build the application, from the **Build** menu select **Build Solution**. If the application builds successfully, run the application by selecting **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu.

   The wizard automatically creates an application that has a standard menu bar, a standard toolbar, a standard status bar, and an Outlook bar to the left of the window with a **Folders** view and a **Calendar** view.

### To add the shell list control to the document view

1. In this section, you'll add an instance of `CMFCShellListCtrl` to the view that the wizard created. Open the view header file by double-clicking **MFCShellControlsView.h** in the **Solution Explorer**.

   Locate the `#pragma once` directive near the top of the header file. Immediately underneath it add this code to include the header file for `CMFCShellListCtrl`:

   ```cpp
   #include <afxShellListCtrl.h>
   ```

   Now add a member variable of type `CMFCShellListCtrl`. First, locate the following comment in the header file:

   ```cpp
   // Generated message map functions
   ```

   Immediately above that comment, add this code:

   ```cpp
   private:
   CMFCShellListCtrl m_wndList;
   ```

1. The **MFC Application Wizard** already created a `CMFCShellTreeCtrl` object in the `CMainFrame` class, but it's a protected member. We'll access the object later, so create an accessor for it now. Open the MainFrm.h header file by double-clicking it in the **Solution Explorer**. Locate the following comment:

   ```cpp
   // Attributes
   ```

   Immediately under it, add the following method declaration:

   ```cpp
   public:
       CMFCShellTreeCtrl& GetShellTreeCtrl();
   ```

   Next, open the MainFrm.cpp source file by double-clicking it in the **Solution Explorer**. At the bottom of that file, add the following method definition:

   ```cpp
   CMFCShellTreeCtrl& CMainFrame::GetShellTreeCtrl()
   {
        return m_wndTree;
   }
   ```

1. Now we update the `CMFCShellControlsView` class to handle the `WM_CREATE` windows message. Open the **Class View** window and select the `CMFCShellControlsView` class. Right-click and select **Properties**.

    Next, in the **Properties** window, click the **Messages** icon. Scroll down until you find the `WM_CREATE` message. From the drop-down list next to `WM_CREATE`, select **\<Add> OnCreate**. The command creates a message handler for us and automatically updates the MFC message map.

   In the `OnCreate` method, we'll now create our `CMFCShellListCtrl` object. Find the `OnCreate` method definition in the MFCShellControlsView.cpp source file, and replace its implementation with the following code:

    ```cpp
    int CMFCShellControlsView::OnCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct)
    {
        if (CView::OnCreate(lpCreateStruct) == -1)
            return -1;

        CRect rectDummy (0, 0, 0, 0);

        m_wndList.Create(WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | LVS_REPORT,
            rectDummy, this, 1);

        return 0;
    }
    ```

1. Repeat the previous step but for the `WM_SIZE` message. It will cause your applications view to be redrawn whenever a user changes the size of the application window. Replace the definition for the `OnSize` method with the following code:

    ```cpp
    void CMFCShellControlsView::OnSize(UINT nType, int cx, int cy)
    {
        CView::OnSize(nType, cx, cy);

        m_wndList.SetWindowPos(NULL, -1, -1, cx, cy,
            SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOZORDER | SWP_NOACTIVATE);
    }
    ```

1. The last step is to connect the `CMFCShellTreeCtrl` and `CMFCShellListCtrl` objects by using the [CMFCShellTreeCtrl::SetRelatedList](../mfc/reference/cmfcshelltreectrl-class.md#setrelatedlist) method. After you call `CMFCShellTreeCtrl::SetRelatedList`, the `CMFCShellListCtrl` will automatically display the contents of the item selected in the `CMFCShellTreeCtrl`. We connect the objects in the `OnActivateView` method, which is overridden from [CView::OnActivateView](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#onactivateview).

   In the MFCShellControlsView.h header file, inside the `CMFCShellControlsView` class declaration, add the following method declaration:

    ```cpp
    protected:
    virtual void OnActivateView(BOOL bActivate,
        CView* pActivateView,
        CView* pDeactivateView);
    ```

   Next, add the definition for the method to the MFCShellControlsView.cpp source file:

    ```cpp
    void CMFCShellControlsView::OnActivateView(BOOL bActivate,
        CView* pActivateView,
        CView* pDeactivateView)
    {
        if (bActivate&& AfxGetMainWnd() != NULL)
        {
            ((CMainFrame*)AfxGetMainWnd())->GetShellTreeCtrl().SetRelatedList(&m_wndList);
        }

        CView::OnActivateView(bActivate,
            pActivateView,
            pDeactivateView);
    }
    ```

   Because we're calling methods from the `CMainFrame` class, we must add an `#include` directive at the top of the MFCShellControlsView.cpp source file:

    ```cpp
    #include "MainFrm.h"
    ```

1. Verify that the application was created successfully by building and running it. To build the application, from the **Build** menu select **Build Solution**. If the application builds successfully, run it by selecting **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu.

   You should now see the details for the item selected in the `CMFCShellTreeCtrl` in the view pane. When you click a node in the `CMFCShellTreeCtrl`, the `CMFCShellListCtrl` will be automatically updated. Likewise, if you double-click a folder in the `CMFCShellListCtrl`, the `CMFCShellTreeCtrl` should be automatically updated.

   Right-click any item in the tree control or in the list control. You get the same context menu as if you were using the real **File Explorer**.

## Next Steps

- The wizard created an Outlook bar with both a **Folders** pane and a **Calendar** pane. It probably doesn't make sense to have a **Calendar** pane in an **Explorer** window, so remove that pane now.

- The `CMFCShellListCtrl` supports viewing files in different modes, such as **Large Icons**, **Small Icons**, **List**, and **Details**. Update your application to implement this functionality. Hint: see [Visual C++ Samples](../visual-cpp-samples.md).
