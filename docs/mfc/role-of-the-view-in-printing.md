# Role of the View in Printing

Your view also plays two important roles in printing its associated document.

The view:

- Uses the same [OnDraw](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#ondraw) code to draw on the printer as to draw on the screen.

- Manages dividing the document into pages for printing.

For more information about printing and about the view's role in printing, see [Printing and Print Preview](../mfc/printing-and-print-preview.md).
