# Initializing the Parts of a CStatusBarCtrl Object

By default, a status bar displays status information using separate panes. These panes (also referred to as parts) can contain either a text string, an icon, or both.

Use [SetParts](reference/cstatusbarctrl-class.md#setparts) to define how many parts, and the length, the status bar will have. After you have created the parts of the status bar, make calls to [SetText](reference/cstatusbarctrl-class.md#settext) and [SetIcon](reference/cstatusbarctrl-class.md#seticon) to set the text or icon for a specific part of the status bar. Once the part has been successfully set, the control is automatically redrawn.

The following example initializes an existing `CStatusBarCtrl` object (`m_StatusBarCtrl`) with four panes and then sets an icon (IDI_ICON1) and some text in the second part.

For more information on setting the mode of a `CStatusBarCtrl` object to simple, see [Setting the Mode of a CStatusBarCtrl Object](setting-the-mode-of-a-cstatusbarctrl-object.md).
