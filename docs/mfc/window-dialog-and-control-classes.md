# Window, Dialog, and Control Classes

Class `CWnd` and its derived classes encapsulate an `HWND`, a handle to a Windows window. `CWnd` can be used by itself or as a base for deriving new classes. The derived classes supplied by the class library represent various kinds of windows.

[CWnd](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md)<br/>
The base class for all windows. You can use one of the classes derived from `CWnd` or derive your own classes directly from it.
