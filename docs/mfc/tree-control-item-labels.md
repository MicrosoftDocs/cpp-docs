# Tree Control Item Labels
You typically specify the text of an item's label when adding the item to the tree control ([CTreeCtrl](../mfc/reference/ctreectrl-class.md)). The `InsertItem` member function can pass a [TVITEM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb773456) structure that defines the item's properties, including a string containing the text of the label. `InsertItem` has several overloads that can be called with various combinations of parameters.  
  
 A tree control allocates memory for storing each item; the text of the item labels takes up a significant portion of this memory. If your application maintains a copy of the strings in the tree control, you can decrease the memory requirements of the control by specifying the **LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK** value in the *pszText* member of `TV_ITEM` or the *lpszItem* parameter instead of passing actual strings to the tree control. Using **LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK** causes the tree control to retrieve the text of an item's label from the application whenever the item needs to be redrawn. To retrieve the text, the tree control sends a [TVN_GETDISPINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb773518) notification message, which includes the address of a [NMTVDISPINFO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb773418) structure. You must respond by setting the appropriate members of the included structure.  
  
 A tree control uses memory allocated from the heap of the process that creates the tree control. The maximum number of items in a tree control is based on the amount of memory available in the heap. Each item takes 64 bytes.
