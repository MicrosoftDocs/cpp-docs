# ActiveX Control Containers: Connecting an ActiveX Control to a Member Variable

The easiest way to access an ActiveX control from within its control container application is to associate the ActiveX control with a member variable of the dialog class that will contain the control.

> [!NOTE]
>  This is not the only way to access an embedded control from within a container class, but for the purposes of this article it is sufficient.

### Adding a member variable to the dialog class

1. From Class View, right-click the main dialog class to open the shortcut menu. For example, `CContainerDlg`.

1. From the shortcut menu, click **Add** and then **Add Variable**.

1. In the Add Member Variable Wizard, click **Control variable**.

1. In the **Control ID** list box, select the control ID of the embedded ActiveX control. For example, `IDC_CIRCCTRL1`.

1. In the **Variable Name** box, enter a name.

   For example, *m_circctl*.

1. Click **Finish** to accept your choices and exit the Add Member Variable Wizard.
