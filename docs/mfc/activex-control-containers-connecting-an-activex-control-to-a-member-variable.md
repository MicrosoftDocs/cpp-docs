# ActiveX Control Containers: Connecting an ActiveX Control to a Member Variable
The easiest way to access an ActiveX control from within its control container application is to associate the ActiveX control with a member variable of the dialog class that will contain the control.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This is not the only way to access an embedded control from within a container class, but for the purposes of this article it is sufficient.  
  
### Adding a member variable to the dialog class  
  
1.  From Class View, right-click the main dialog class to open the shortcut menu. For example, `CContainerDlg`.  
  
2.  From the shortcut menu, click **Add** and then **Add Variable**.  
  
3.  In the Add Member Variable Wizard, click **Control variable**.  
  
4.  In the **Control ID** list box, select the control ID of the embedded ActiveX control. For example, `IDC_CIRCCTRL1`.  
  
5.  In the **Variable Name** box, enter a name.  
  
     For example, *m_circctl*.  
  
6.  Click **Finish** to accept your choices and exit the Add Member Variable Wizard.
