# Walkthroughs (MFC)
This section contains articles that walk you through various tasks associated with new MFC library features.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Walkthrough: Using the New MFC Shell Controls](../mfc/walkthrough-using-the-new-mfc-shell-controls.md)

The left pane will contain a [CMFCShellTreeCtrl](../mfc/reference/cmfcshelltreectrl-class.md) object that will display your Desktop in a hierarchical view. The right pane will contain a [CMFCShellListCtrl](../mfc/reference/cmfcshelllistctrl-class.md) that will show the files in the folder that is selected in the left pane.
