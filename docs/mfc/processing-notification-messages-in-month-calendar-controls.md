# Processing Notification Messages in Month Calendar Controls

As users interact with the month calendar control (selecting dates and/or viewing a different month), the control (`CMonthCalCtrl`) sends notification messages to its parent window, usually a view or dialog object. Handle these messages if you want to do something in response. For example, when the user selects a new month to view, you could provide a set of dates that should be emphasized.

Use the [Class Wizard](reference/mfc-class-wizard.md) to add notification handlers to the parent class for those messages you want to implement.

The following list describes the various notifications sent by the month calendar control.

- MCN_GETDAYSTATE Requests information about which days should be displayed in bold. For information on handling this notification, see [Setting the Day State of a Month Calendar Control](../mfc/setting-the-day-state-of-a-month-calendar-control.md).

- MCN_SELCHANGE Notifies the parent that the selected date or range of the date has changed.

- MCN_SELECT Notifies the parent that an explicit date selection has been made.
