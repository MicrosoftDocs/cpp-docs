# Classes Related to Rich Edit Controls

The [CRichEditView](../mfc/reference/cricheditview-class.md), [CRichEditDoc](../mfc/reference/cricheditdoc-class.md), and [CRichEditCntrItem](../mfc/reference/cricheditcntritem-class.md) classes provide the functionality of the rich edit control ([CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md)) within the context of MFC's document/view architecture. `CRichEditView` maintains the text and formatting characteristic of text. `CRichEditDoc` maintains the list of OLE client items that are in the view. `CRichEditCntrItem` provides container-side access to the OLE client item. To modify the contents of a `CRichEditView`, use [CRichEditView::GetRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditview-class.md#getricheditctrl) to access the underlying rich edit control.
