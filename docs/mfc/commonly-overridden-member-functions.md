# Commonly Overridden Member Functions
The following table lists the most likely member functions to override in your `CDialog`-derived class.  
  
### Commonly Overridden Member Functions of Class CDialog  
  
|Member function|Message it responds to|Purpose of the override|  
|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|  
|`OnInitDialog`|**WM_INITDIALOG**|Initialize the dialog box's controls.|  
|`OnOK`|**BN_CLICKED** for button **IDOK**|Respond when the user clicks the OK button.|  
|`OnCancel`|**BN_CLICKED** for button **IDCANCEL**|Respond when the user clicks the Cancel button.|  
  
 `OnInitDialog`, `OnOK`, and `OnCancel` are virtual functions. To override them, you declare an overriding function in your derived dialog class using the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).  
  
 `OnInitDialog` is called just before the dialog box is displayed. You must call the default `OnInitDialog` handler from your override — usually as the first action in the handler. By default, `OnInitDialog` returns **TRUE** to indicate that the focus should be set to the first control in the dialog box.  
  
 `OnOK` is typically overridden for modeless but not modal dialog boxes. If you override this handler for a modal dialog box, call the base class version from your override — to ensure that `EndDialog` is called — or call `EndDialog` yourself.  
  
 `OnCancel` is usually overridden for modeless dialog boxes.  
  
 For more information about these member functions, see class [CDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md) in the *MFC Reference* and the discussion on [Life Cycle of a Dialog Box](../mfc/life-cycle-of-a-dialog-box.md).
