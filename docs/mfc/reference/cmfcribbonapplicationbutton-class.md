|[CMFCRibbonApplicationButton::CMFCRibbonApplicationButton](#cmfcribbonapplicationbutton)|Constructs and initializes a `CMFCRibbonApplicationButton` object.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`CMFCRibbonApplicationButton::CreateObject`|Used by the framework to create a dynamic instance of this class type.|  
|`CMFCRibbonApplicationButton::GetThisClass`|Used by the framework to obtain a pointer to the [CRuntimeClass](../../mfc/reference/cruntimeclass-structure.md) object that is associated with this class type.|  
|[CMFCRibbonApplicationButton::SetImage](#setimage)|Assigns an image to the ribbon application button.|  
  
## Example  
 The following example demonstrates how to use various methods in the `CMFCRibbonApplicationButton` class. The example shows how to assign an image to the application button, and how to set its tooltip. This code snippet is part of the [Draw Client sample](../../visual-cpp-samples.md).

## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxRibbonBar.h  
  
##  <a name="cmfcribbonapplicationbutton"></a>  CMFCRibbonApplicationButton::CMFCRibbonApplicationButton  
 Constructs and initializes a [CMFCRibbonApplicationButton](../../mfc/reference/cmfcribbonapplicationbutton-class.md) object.  
  
```  
CMFCRibbonApplicationButton();  
CMFCRibbonApplicationButton(UINT uiBmpResID);  
  CMFCRibbonApplicationButton(HBITMAP hBmp);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *uiBmpResID*  
 The resource ID of the image to display on the application button.  
  
 *hBmp*  
 A handle to a bitmap to display on the application button.  
  
### Remarks

##  <a name="setimage"></a>  CMFCRibbonApplicationButton::SetImage  
 Assigns an image to the application button.  
  
```  
void SetImage(UINT uiBmpResID);  
void SetImage(HBITMAP hBmp);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 [in] *uiBmpResID*  
 The resource ID of the image to display on the application button.  
  
 [in] *hBmp*  
 A handle to a bitmap to display on the application button.  
  
### Remarks
