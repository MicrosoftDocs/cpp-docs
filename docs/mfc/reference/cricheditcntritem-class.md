# CRichEditCntrItem Class
With [CRichEditView](../../mfc/reference/cricheditview-class.md) and [CRichEditDoc](../../mfc/reference/cricheditdoc-class.md), provides the functionality of the rich edit control within the context of MFC's document view architecture.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class CRichEditCntrItem : public COleClientItem  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CRichEditCntrItem::CRichEditCntrItem](#cricheditcntritem)|Constructs a `CRichEditCntrItem` object.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CRichEditCntrItem::SyncToRichEditObject](#synctoricheditobject)|Activates the item as another type.|  
  
## Remarks  
 A "rich edit control" is a window in which the user can enter and edit text. The text can be assigned character and paragraph formatting, and can include embedded OLE objects. Rich edit controls provide a programming interface for formatting text. However, an application must implement any user interface components necessary to make formatting operations available to the user.  
  
 `CRichEditView` maintains the text and formatting characteristic of text. `CRichEditDoc` maintains the list of OLE client items which are in the view. `CRichEditCntrItem` provides container-side access to the OLE client item.  
  
 This Windows Common control (and therefore the [CRichEditCtrl](../../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md) and related classes) is available only to programs running under Windows 95/98 and Windows NT versions 3.51 and later.  
  
 For an example of using rich edit container items in an MFC application, see the [WORDPAD](../../visual-cpp-samples.md) sample application.

 `CRichEditCntrItem`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxrich.h  
  
##  <a name="cricheditcntritem"></a>  CRichEditCntrItem::CRichEditCntrItem  
 Call this function to create a `CRichEditCntrItem` object and add it to the container document.  
  
```  
CRichEditCntrItem(
    REOBJECT* preo = NULL,  
    CRichEditDoc* pContainer = NULL);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *preo*  
 Pointer to an [REOBJECT](/windows/desktop/api/richole/ns-richole-_reobject) structure which describes an OLE item. The new `CRichEditCntrItem` object is constructed around this OLE item. If *preo* is NULL, the client item is empty.  
  
 *pContainer*  
 Pointer to the container document that will contain this item. If *pContainer* is NULL, you must explicitly call [COleDocument::AddItem](../../mfc/reference/coledocument-class.md#additem) to add this client item to a document.  
  
### Remarks  
 This function does not perform any OLE initialization.  
  
 For more information, see the [REOBJECT](/windows/desktop/api/richole/ns-richole-_reobject) structure in the Windows SDK.  
  
##  <a name="synctoricheditobject"></a>  CRichEditCntrItem::SyncToRichEditObject  
 Call this function to synchronize the device aspect, [DVASPECT](/windows/desktop/api/wtypes/ne-wtypes-tagdvaspect), of this `CRichEditCntrltem` to that specified by *reo*.  
  
```  
void SyncToRichEditObject(REOBJECT& reo);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *reo*  
 Reference to an [REOBJECT](/windows/desktop/api/richole/ns-richole-_reobject) structure which describes an OLE item.  
  
### Remarks  
 For more information, see [DVASPECT](/windows/desktop/api/wtypes/ne-wtypes-tagdvaspect) in the Windows SDK.
