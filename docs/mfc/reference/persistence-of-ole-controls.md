# Persistence of OLE Controls
One capability of OLE controls is property persistence (or serialization), which allows the OLE control to read or write property values to and from a file or stream. A container application can use serialization to store a control's property values even after the application has destroyed the control. The property values of the OLE control can then be read from the file or stream when a new instance of the control is created at a later time.  
  
### Persistence of OLE Controls  
  
|||

##  <a name="px_blob"></a>  PX_Blob  
 Call this function within your control's `DoPropExchange` member function to serialize or initialize a property that stores binary large object (BLOB) data.  
  
```  
 
BOOL  
PX_Blob(
    CPropExchange* 
pPX  ,  
    LPCTSTR 
pszPropName  ,  
    HGLOBAL& 
hBlob  ,  
    HGLOBAL 
hBlobDefault  
= NULL);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pPX*  
 Pointer to the [CPropExchange](../../mfc/reference/cpropexchange-class.md) object (typically passed as a parameter to `DoPropExchange`).  
  
 *pszPropName*  
 The name of the property being exchanged.  
  
 *hBlob*  
 Reference to the variable where the property is stored (typically a member variable of your class).  
  
 *hBlobDefault*  
 Default value for the property.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if the exchange was successful; 0 if unsuccessful.  
  
### Remarks  
 The property's value will be read from or written to the variable referenced by *hBlob*, as appropriate. This variable should be initialized to NULL before initially calling `PX_Blob` for the first time (typically, this can be done in the control's constructor). If *hBlobDefault* is specified, it will be used as the property's default value. This value is used if, for any reason, the control's initialization or serialization process fails.  
  
 The handles *hBlob* and *hBlobDefault* refer to a block of memory which contains the following:  
  
-   A DWORD which contains the length, in bytes, of the binary data that follows, followed immediately by  
  
-   A block of memory containing the actual binary data.  
  
 Note that `PX_Blob` will allocate memory, using the Windows [GlobalAlloc](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366574) API, when loading BLOB-type properties. You are responsible for freeing this memory. Therefore, the destructor of your control should call [GlobalFree](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa366579) on any BLOB-type property handles to free up any memory allocated to your control.

pszPropName  ,  
    CFontHolder& 
font  ,  
    const 
FONTDESC  
FAR* 
pFontDesc  
= 
NULL,  
    LPFONTDISP 
pFontDispAmbient  
= NULL);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pPX*  
 Pointer to the [CPropExchange](../../mfc/reference/cpropexchange-class.md) object (typically passed as a parameter to `DoPropExchange`).  
  
 *pszPropName*  
 The name of the property being exchanged.  
  
 *font*

### Remarks  
 The property's value is read from or written to `font`, a `CFontHolder` reference, when appropriate. If *pFontDesc* and *pFontDispAmbient* are specified, they are used for initializing the property's default value, when needed. These values are used if, for any reason, the control's serialization process fails. Typically, you pass NULL for *pFontDesc* and the ambient value returned by `COleControl::AmbientFont` for *pFontDispAmbient*. Note that the font object returned by `COleControl::AmbientFont` must be released by a call to the `IFontDisp::Release` member function.

 Reference to the variable where the property is stored (typically a member variable of your class).  
  
 *strDefault*  
 Default value for the property.  
  
### Return Value

##  <a name="px_vbxfontconvert"></a>  PX_VBXFontConvert  
 Call this function within your control's `DoPropExchange` member function to initialize a font property by converting a VBX control's font-related properties.  
  
```  
 
BOOL  
PX_VBXFontConvert(
    CPropExchange* 
pPX  ,  
    CFontHolder& font);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pPX*  
 Pointer to the [CPropExchange](../../mfc/reference/cpropexchange-class.md) object (typically passed as a parameter to `DoPropExchange`).  
  
 *font*  
 The font property of the OLE control that will contain the converted VBX font-related properties.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if the exchange was successful; 0 if unsuccessful.  
  
### Remarks  
 This function should be used only by an OLE control that is designed as a direct replacement for a VBX control. When the Visual Basic development environment converts a form containing a VBX control to use the corresponding replacement OLE control, it will call the control's `IDataObject::SetData` function, passing in a property set that contains the VBX control's property data. This operation, in turn, causes the control's `DoPropExchange` function to be invoked. `DoPropExchange` can call `PX_VBXFontConvert` to convert the VBX control's font-related properties (for example, "FontName," "FontSize," and so on) into the corresponding components of the OLE control's font property.  
  
 `PX_VBXFontConvert` should only be called when the control is actually being converted from a VBX form application. For example:
