# WINDOWPLACEMENT Structure
The `WINDOWPLACEMENT` structure contains information about the placement of a window on the screen.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct tagWINDOWPLACEMENT {     /* wndpl */  
    UINT length;  
    UINT flags;  
    UINT showCmd;  
    POINT ptMinPosition;  
    POINT ptMaxPosition;  
    RECT rcNormalPosition;  
} WINDOWPLACEMENT;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *length*  
 Specifies the length, in bytes, of the structure.  
  
 *flags*  
 Specifies flags that control the position of the minimized window and the method by which the window is restored. This member can be one or both of the following flags:  
  
- WPF_SETMINPOSITION Specifies that the x- and y-positions of the minimized window can be specified. This flag must be specified if the coordinates are set in the `ptMinPosition` member.  
  
- WPF_RESTORETOMAXIMIZED Specifies that the restored window will be maximized, regardless of whether it was maximized before it was minimized. This setting is valid only the next time the window is restored. It does not change the default restoration behavior. This flag is valid only when the SW_SHOWMINIMIZED value is specified for the `showCmd` member.  
  
 *showCmd*  
 Specifies the current show state of the window. This member can be one of the following values:  
  
- SW_HIDE Hides the window and passes activation to another window.  
  
- SW_MINIMIZE Minimizes the specified window and activates the top-level window in the system's list.  
  
- SW_RESTORE Activates and displays a window. If the window is minimized or maximized, Windows restores it to its original size and position (same as SW_SHOWNORMAL).  
  
- SW_SHOW Activates a window and displays it in its current size and position.  
  
- SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED Activates a window and displays it as a maximized window.  
  
- SW_SHOWMINIMIZED Activates a window and displays it as an icon.  
  
- SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE Displays a window as an icon. The window that is currently active remains active.  
  
- SW_SHOWNA Displays a window in its current state. The window that is currently active remains active.  
  
- SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE Displays a window in its most recent size and position. The window that is currently active remains active.  
  
- SW_SHOWNORMAL Activates and displays a window. If the window is minimized or maximized, Windows restores it to its original size and position (same as SW_RESTORE).  
  
 *ptMinPosition*  
 Specifies the position of the window's top-left corner when the window is minimized.  
  
 *ptMaxPosition*  
 Specifies the position of the window's top-left corner when the window is maximized.  
  
 *rcNormalPosition*  
 Specifies the window's coordinates when the window is in the normal (restored) position.
