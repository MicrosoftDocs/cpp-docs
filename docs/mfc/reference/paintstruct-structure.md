# PAINTSTRUCT Structure
The `PAINTSTRUCT` structure contains information that can be used to paint the client area of a window.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct tagPAINTSTRUCT {  
    HDC hdc;  
    BOOL fErase;  
    RECT rcPaint;  
    BOOL fRestore;  
    BOOL fIncUpdate;  
    BYTE rgbReserved[16];  
} PAINTSTRUCT;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *hdc*  
 Identifies the display context to be used for painting.  
  
 *fErase*  
 Specifies whether the background needs to be redrawn. It is not 0 if the application should redraw the background. The application is responsible for drawing the background if a Windows window-class is created without a background brush (see the description of the `hbrBackground` member of the [WNDCLASS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms633576) structure in the Windows SDK).  
  
 *rcPaint*  
 Specifies the upper left and lower right corners of the rectangle in which the painting is requested.  
  
 *fRestore*  
 Reserved member. It is used internally by Windows.  
  
 *fIncUpdate*  
 Reserved member. It is used internally by Windows.  
  
 *rgbReserved[16]*  
 Reserved member. A reserved block of memory used internally by Windows.
