# CDaoErrorInfo Structure
The `CDaoErrorInfo` structure contains information about an error object defined for data access objects (DAO).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
struct CDaoErrorInfo  
{  
    long m_lErrorCode;  
    CString m_strSource;  
    CString m_strDescription;  
    CString m_strHelpFile;  
    long m_lHelpContext;  
};  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *m_lErrorCode*  
 A numeric DAO error code. See the topic "Trappable Data Access Errors" in DAO Help.  
  
 *m_strSource*  
 The name of the object or application that originally generated the error. The Source property specifies a string expression representing the object that originally generated the error; the expression is usually the object's class name. For details, see the topic "Source Property" in DAO Help.  
  
 *m_strDescription*  
 A descriptive string associated with an error. For details, see the topic "Description Property" in DAO Help.  
  
 *m_strHelpFile*  
 A fully qualified path to a Microsoft Windows Help file. For details, see the topic "HelpContext, HelpFile Properties" in DAO Help.  
  
 *m_lHelpContext*  
 A context ID for a topic in a Microsoft Windows Help file. For details, see the topic "HelpContext, HelpFile Properties" in DAO Help.  
  
## Remarks  
 MFC does not encapsulate DAO error objects in a class. Instead, the [CDaoException](../../mfc/reference/cdaoexception-class.md) class supplies an interface for accessing the Errors collection contained in the DAO `DBEngine` object, the object that also contains all workspaces. When an MFC DAO operation throws a `CDaoException` object that you catch, MFC fills a `CDaoErrorInfo` structure and stores it in the exception object's [m_pErrorInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaoexception-class.md#m_perrorinfo) member. (If you choose to call DAO directly, you must call the exception object's [GetErrorInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaoexception-class.md#geterrorinfo) member function yourself to fill `m_pErrorInfo`.)  
  
 For more information about handling DAO errors, see the article [Exceptions: Database Exceptions](../../mfc/exceptions-database-exceptions.md). For related information, see the topic "Error Object" in DAO Help.  
  
 Information retrieved by the [CDaoException::GetErrorInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaoexception-class.md#geterrorinfo) member function is stored in a `CDaoErrorInfo` structure. Examine the [m_pErrorInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaoexception-class.md#m_perrorinfo) data member from a `CDaoException` object that you catch in an exception handler, or call `GetErrorInfo` from a `CDaoException` object that you create explicitly in order to check errors that might have occurred during a direct call to the DAO interfaces. `CDaoErrorInfo` also defines a `Dump` member function in debug builds. You can use `Dump` to dump the contents of a `CDaoErrorInfo` object.
