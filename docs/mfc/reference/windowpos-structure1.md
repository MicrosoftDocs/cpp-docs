# WINDOWPOS Structure1
The `WINDOWPOS` structure contains information about the size and position of a window.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct tagWINDOWPOS { /* wp */  
    HWND hwnd;  
    HWND hwndInsertAfter;  
    int x;  
    int y;  
    int cx;  
    int cy;  
    UINT flags;  
} WINDOWPOS;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *hwnd*  
 Identifies the window.  
  
 *hwndInsertAfter*  
 Identifies the window behind which this window is placed.  
  
 *x*  
 Specifies the position of the left edge of the window.  
  
 *y*  
 Specifies the position of the right edge of the window.  
  
 *cx*  
 Specifies the window width, in pixels.  
  
 *cy*  
 Specifies the window height, in pixels.  
  
 *flags*  
 Specifies window-positioning options. This member can be one of the following values:  
  
- SWP_DRAWFRAME Draws a frame (defined in the class description for the window) around the window. The window receives a WM_NCCALCSIZE message.  
  
- SWP_FRAMECHANGED Sends a WM_NCCALCSIZE message to the window, even if the window's size is not being changed. If this flag is not specified, WM_NCCALCSIZE is sent only when the window's size is being changed.  
  
- SWP_HIDEWINDOW Hides the window.  
  
- SWP_NOACTIVATE Does not activate the window.  
  
- SWP_NOCOPYBITS Discards the entire contents of the client area. If this flag is not specified, the valid contents of the client area are saved and copied back into the client area after the window is sized or repositioned.  
  
- SWP_NOMOVE Retains current position (ignores the `x` and `y` members).  
  
- SWP_NOOWNERZORDER Does not change the owner window's position in the Z-order.  
  
- SWP_NOSIZE Retains current size (ignores the `cx` and `cy` members).  
  
- SWP_NOREDRAW Does not redraw changes.  
  
- SWP_NOREPOSITION Same as SWP_NOOWNERZORDER.  
  
- SWP_NOSENDCHANGING Prevents the window from receiving the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING message.  
  
- SWP_NOZORDER Retains current ordering (ignores the `hwndInsertAfter` member).  
  
- SWP_SHOWWINDOW Displays the window.
