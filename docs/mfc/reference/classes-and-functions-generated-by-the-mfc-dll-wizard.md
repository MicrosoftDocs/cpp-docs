# Classes and Functions Generated by the MFC DLL Wizard

The code that the MFC DLL Wizard generates depends on the kind of DLL you are creating and the options you have selected. The MFC DLL Wizard generates the same code for both forms of regular MFC DLLs.

|Kind of DLL|Option|Classes|Functions|
|-----------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
|[Extension](../../build/extension-dlls-overview.md)|None|None|`DllMain`|
|[Regular](../../build/regular-dlls-dynamically-linked-to-mfc.md)|None|Application class derived from `CWinApp`|None|
|[Regular](../../build/regular-dlls-dynamically-linked-to-mfc.md)|Automation|Application class derived from `CWinApp`|`DllGetClassObject` `DllCanUnloadNow` `DllRegisterServer`|
|[Extension](../../build/extension-dlls-overview.md)|Window Sockets|None|`DllMain`|
|[Regular](../../build/regular-dlls-dynamically-linked-to-mfc.md)|Window Sockets|Application class derived from `CWinApp`|`InitInstance` contains call to `AfxSocketInit`|
