### Public Data Members  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CPageSetupDialog::m_psd](#m_psd)|A structure used to customize a `CPageSetupDialog` object.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This class is designed to take the place of the Print Setup dialog box.  
  
 To use a `CPageSetupDialog` object, first create the object using the `CPageSetupDialog` constructor. Once the dialog box has been constructed, you can set or modify any values in the `m_psd` data member to initialize the values of the dialog box's controls. The [m_psd](#m_psd) structure is of type PAGESETUPDLG.  
  
 After initializing the dialog box controls, call the `DoModal` member function to display the dialog box and allow the user to select print options. `DoModal` returns whether the user selected the OK (IDOK) or Cancel (IDCANCEL) button.  
  
 If `DoModal` returns IDOK, you can use several of `CPageSetupDialog`'s member functions, or access the `m_psd` data member, to retrieve information input by the user.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  After the common OLE Page Setup dialog box is dismissed, any changes made by the user will not be saved by the framework. It is up to the application itself to save any values from this dialog box to a permanent location, such as member of the application's document or application class.

 `CPageSetupDialog`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxdlgs.h  
  
##  <a name="cpagesetupdialog"></a>  CPageSetupDialog::CPageSetupDialog  
 Call this function to construct a `CPageSetupDialog` object.  
  
```  
CPageSetupDialog(
    DWORD dwFlags = PSD_MARGINS | PSD_INWININIINTLMEASURE,  
    CWnd* pParentWnd = NULL);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *dwFlags*  
 One or more flags you can use to customize the settings of the dialog box. The values can be combined using the bitwise-OR operator. These values have the following meanings:  
  
- PSD_DEFAULTMINMARGINS Sets the minimum allowable widths for the page margins to be the same as the printer's minimums. This flag is ignored if the PSD_MARGINS and PSD_MINMARGINS flags are also specified.  
  
- PSD_INWININIINTLMEASURE Not implemented.  
  
- PSD_MINMARGINS Causes the system to use the values specified in the `rtMinMargin` member as the minimum allowable widths for the left, top, right, and bottom margins. The system prevents the user from entering a width that is less than the specified minimum. If PSD_MINMARGINS is not specified, the system sets the minimum allowable widths to those allowed by the printer.  
  
- PSD_MARGINS Activates the margin control area.  
  
- PSD_INTHOUSANDTHSOFINCHES Causes the units of the dialog box to be measured in 1/1000 of an inch.  
  
- PSD_INHUNDREDTHSOFMILLIMETERS Causes the units of the dialog box to be measured in 1/100 of a millimeter.  
  
- PSD_DISABLEMARGINS Disables the margin dialog box controls.  
  
- PSD_DISABLEPRINTER Disables the Printer button.  
  
- PSD_NOWARNING Prevents the warning message from being displayed when there is no default printer.  
  
- PSD_DISABLEORIENTATION Disables the page orientation dialog control.  
  
- PSD_RETURNDEFAULT Causes `CPageSetupDialog` to return [DEVMODE](/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-_devicemodea) and [DEVNAMES](../../mfc/reference/devnames-structure.md) structures that are initialized for the system default printer without displaying a dialog box. It is assumed that both `hDevNames` and `hDevMode` are NULL; otherwise, the function returns an error. If the system default printer is supported by an old printer driver (earlier than Windows version 3.0), only `hDevNames` is returned; `hDevMode` is NULL.  
  
- PSD_DISABLEPAPER Disables the paper selection control.  
  
- PSD_SHOWHELP Causes the dialog box to show the Help button. The `hwndOwner` member must not be NULL if this flag is specified.  
  
- PSD_ENABLEPAGESETUPHOOK Enables the hook function specified in `lpfnSetupHook`.  
  
- PSD_ENABLEPAGESETUPTEMPLATE Causes the operating system to create the dialog box by using the dialog template box identified by `hInstance` and `lpSetupTemplateName`.  
  
- PSD_ENABLEPAGESETUPTEMPLATEHANDLE Indicates that `hInstance` identifies a data block that contains a preloaded dialog box template. The system ignores `lpSetupTemplateName` if this flag is specified.  
  
- PSD_ENABLEPAGEPAINTHOOK Enables the hook function specified in `lpfnPagePaintHook`.  
  
- PSD_DISABLEPAGEPAINTING Disables the draw area of the dialog box.  
  
 *pParentWnd*  
 Pointer to the dialog box's parent or owner.  
  
### Remarks  
 Use the [DoModal](../../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#domodal) function to display the dialog box.  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#94](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cpagesetupdialog-class_1.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="createprinterdc"></a>  CPageSetupDialog::CreatePrinterDC  
 Creates a printer device context from the [DEVMODE](/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-_devicemodea) and [DEVNAMES](../../mfc/reference/devnames-structure.md) structures.  
  
```  
HDC CreatePrinterDC();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 Handle to the newly created printer device context (DC).  
  
##  <a name="domodal"></a>  CPageSetupDialog::DoModal  
 Call this function to display the Windows common OLE Page Setup dialog box and allow the user to select various print setup options such as the printing margins, size and orientation of the paper, and destination printer.  
  
```  
virtual INT_PTR DoModal();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 IDOK or IDCANCEL. If IDCANCEL is returned, call the Windows [CommDlgExtendedError](/windows/desktop/api/commdlg/nf-commdlg-commdlgextendederror) function to determine whether an error occurred.  
  
 IDOK and IDCANCEL are constants that indicate whether the user selected the OK or Cancel button.  
  
### Remarks  
 In addition, the user can access the printer setup options such as network location and properties specific to the selected printer.  
  
 If you want to initialize the various Page Setup dialog options by setting members of the `m_psd` structure, you should do so before calling `DoModal`, and after the dialog object is constructed. After calling `DoModal`, call other member functions to retrieve the settings or information input by the user into the dialog box.  
  
 If you want to propagate the current settings entered by the user, make a call to [CWinApp::SelectPrinter](../../mfc/reference/cwinapp-class.md#selectprinter). This function takes the information from the `CPageSetupDialog` object and initializes and selects a new printer DC with the proper attributes.  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#95](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cpagesetupdialog-class_2.cpp)]  
  
### Example  
  See the example for [CPageSetupDialog::CPageSetupDialog](#cpagesetupdialog).  
  
##  <a name="getdevicename"></a>  CPageSetupDialog::GetDeviceName  
 Call this function after `DoModal` to retrieve the name of the currently selected printer.  
  
```  
CString GetDeviceName() const;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The device name used by the `CPageSetupDialog` object.  
  
##  <a name="getdevmode"></a>  CPageSetupDialog::GetDevMode  
 Call this function after calling `DoModal` to retrieve information about the printer device context of the `CPageSetupDialog` object.  
  
```  
LPDEVMODE GetDevMode() const;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The [DEVMODE](/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-_devicemodea) data structure, which contains information about the device initialization and environment of a print driver. You must unlock the memory taken by this structure with the Windows [GlobalUnlock](/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-globalunlock) function, which is described in the Windows SDK.  
  
##  <a name="getdrivername"></a>  CPageSetupDialog::GetDriverName  
 Call this function after calling [DoModal](../../mfc/reference/cprintdialog-class.md#domodal) to retrieve the name of the system-defined printer device driver.  
  
```  
CString GetDriverName() const;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 A `CString` specifying the system-defined driver name.  
  
### Remarks  
 Use a pointer to the `CString` object returned by `GetDriverName` as the value of `lpszDriverName` in a call to [CDC::CreateDC](../../mfc/reference/cdc-class.md#createdc).  
  
##  <a name="getmargins"></a>  CPageSetupDialog::GetMargins  
 Call this function after a call to `DoModal` to retrieve the margins of the printer device driver.  
  
```  
void GetMargins(
    LPRECT lpRectMargins,  
    LPRECT lpRectMinMargins) const;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *lpRectMargins*  
 Pointer to a [RECT](https://www.microsoftonedoc.com/#/organizations/e6f6a65cf14f462597b64ac058dbe1d0/projects/3fedad16-eaf1-41a6-8f96-0c1949c68f32/containers/a3daf831-1c5f-4bbe-964d-503870caf874/tocpaths/18113766-3975-4369-bc07-92e34cba712e/locales/en-us) structure or [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object that describes (in 1/1000 inches or 1/100 mm) the print margins for the currently selected printer. Pass NULL for this parameter, if you are not interested in this rectangle.  
  
 *lpRectMinMargins*  
 Pointer to a `RECT` structure or `CRect` object that describes (in 1/1000 inches or 1/100 mm) the minimum print margins for the currently selected printer. Pass NULL for this parameter, if you are not interested in this rectangle.  
  
##  <a name="getpapersize"></a>  CPageSetupDialog::GetPaperSize  
 Call this function to retrieve the size of the paper selected for printing.  
  
```  
CSize GetPaperSize() const;  
```  
  
### Return Value
