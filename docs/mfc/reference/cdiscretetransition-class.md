# CDiscreteTransition Class
Encapsulates a discrete transition.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class CDiscreteTransition : public CBaseTransition;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CDiscreteTransition::CDiscreteTransition](#cdiscretetransition)|Constructs a discrete transition object and initializes its parameters.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CDiscreteTransition::Create](#create)|Calls the transition library to create encapsulated transition COM object. (Overrides [CBaseTransition::Create](../../mfc/reference/cbasetransition-class.md#create).)|  
  
### Public Data Members  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CDiscreteTransition::m_dblFinalValue](#m_dblfinalvalue)|The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.|  
|[CDiscreteTransition::m_delay](#m_delay)|The amount of time by which to delay the instantaneous switch to the final value.|  
|[CDiscreteTransition::m_hold](#m_hold)|The amount of time by which to hold the variable at its final value.|  
  
## Remarks  
 During a discrete transition, the animation variable remains at the initial value for a specified delay time, then switches instantaneously to a specified final value and remains at that value for a given hold time. Because all transitions are cleared automatically, it's recommended to allocated them using operator new. The encapsulated IUIAnimationTransition COM object is created by CAnimationController::AnimateGroup, until then it's NULL. Changing member variables after creation of this COM object has no effect.

## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxanimationcontroller.h  
  
##  <a name="cdiscretetransition"></a>  CDiscreteTransition::CDiscreteTransition  
 Constructs a discrete transition object and initializes its parameters.  
  
```  
CDiscreteTransition(
    UI_ANIMATION_SECONDS delay,  
    DOUBLE dblFinalValue,  
    UI_ANIMATION_SECONDS hold);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *delay*  
 The amount of time by which to delay the instantaneous switch to the final value.  
  
 *dblFinalValue*  
 The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.  
  
 *hold*  
 The amount of time by which to hold the variable at its final value.  
  
##  <a name="create"></a>  CDiscreteTransition::Create  
 Calls the transition library to create encapsulated transition COM object.  
  
```  
virtual BOOL Create(
    IUIAnimationTransitionLibrary* pLibrary,  
    IUIAnimationTransitionFactory* \*not used*\);
```  
  
*pLibrary*  
 A pointer to an [IUIAnimationTransitionLibrary interface](/windows/desktop/api/uianimation/nn-uianimation-iuianimationtransitionlibrary), which defines a library of standard transitions.  

  
### Return Value  
 TRUE if transition is created successfully; otherwise FALSE.  
  
##  <a name="m_dblfinalvalue"></a>  CDiscreteTransition::m_dblFinalValue  
 The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.  
  
```  
DOUBLE m_dblFinalValue;  
```  
  
##  <a name="m_delay"></a>  CDiscreteTransition::m_delay  
 The amount of time by which to delay the instantaneous switch to the final value.  
  
```  
UI_ANIMATION_SECONDS m_delay;  
```  
  
##  <a name="m_hold"></a>  CDiscreteTransition::m_hold  
 The amount of time by which to hold the variable at its final value.  
  
```  
UI_ANIMATION_SECONDS m_hold;  
```
