# CIPAddressCtrl Class
Provides the functionality of the Windows common IP Address control.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class CIPAddressCtrl : public CWnd  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CIPAddressCtrl::CIPAddressCtrl](#cipaddressctrl)|Constructs a `CIPAddressCtrl` object.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CIPAddressCtrl::ClearAddress](#clearaddress)|Clears the contents of the IP Address Control.|  
|[CIPAddressCtrl::Create](#create)|Creates an IP Address Control and attaches it to a `CIPAddressCtrl` object.|  
|[CIPAddressCtrl::CreateEx](#createex)|Creates an IP Address control with the specified Windows extended styles and attaches it to a `CIPAddressCtrl` object.|  
|[CIPAddressCtrl::GetAddress](#getaddress)|Retrieves the address values for all four fields in the IP Address Control.|  
|[CIPAddressCtrl::IsBlank](#isblank)|Determines if all fields in the IP Address Control are empty.|  
|[CIPAddressCtrl::SetAddress](#setaddress)|Sets the address values for all four fields in the IP Address Control.|  
|[CIPAddressCtrl::SetFieldFocus](#setfieldfocus)|Sets the keyboard focus to the specified field in the IP Address Control.|  
|[CIPAddressCtrl::SetFieldRange](#setfieldrange)|Sets the range in the specified field in the IP Address Control.|  
  
## Remarks  
 An IP Address control, a control similar to an edit control, allows you to enter and manipulate a numerical address in Internet Protocol (IP) format.  
  
 This control (and therefore the `CIPAddressCtrl` class) is available only to programs running under Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and later. They will also be available under future versions of Windows and Windows NT.  
  
 For more general information about the IP Address Control, see [IP Address Controls](/windows/desktop/Controls/ip-address-controls) in the Windows SDK.

 `CIPAddressCtrl`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxcmn.h  
  
##  <a name="cipaddressctrl"></a>  CIPAddressCtrl::CIPAddressCtrl  
 Creates a `CIPAddressCtrl` object.  
  
```  
CIPAddressCtrl();
```  
  
##  <a name="clearaddress"></a>  CIPAddressCtrl::ClearAddress  
 Clears the contents of the IP Address Control.  
  
```  
void ClearAddress();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 This member function implements the behavior of the Win32 message [IPM_CLEARADDRESS](/windows/desktop/Controls/ipm-clearaddress), as described in the Windows SDK.  
  
##  <a name="create"></a>  CIPAddressCtrl::Create  
 Creates an IP Address Control and attaches it to a `CIPAddressCtrl` object.  
  
```  
virtual BOOL Create(
    DWORD dwStyle,  
    const RECT& rect,  
    CWnd* pParentWnd,  
    UINT nID);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *dwStyle*  
 The IP Address control's style. Apply a combination of window styles. You must include the WS_CHILD style because the control must be a child window. See [CreateWindow](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowa) in the Windows SDK for a list of windows styles.  
  
 *rect*  
 A reference to the IP Address Control's size and position. It can be either a [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object or a [RECT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162897) structure.  
  
 *pParentWnd*  
 A pointer to the IP Address Control's parent window. It must not be NULL.  
  
 *nID*  
 The IP Address Control's ID.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if initialization was successful; otherwise 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 You construct a `CIPAddressCtrl` object in two steps.  
  
1.  Call the constructor, which creates the `CIPAddressCtrl` object.  
  
2.  Call `Create`, which creates the IP Address Control.  
  
 If you want to use extended windows styles with your control, call [CreateEx](#createex) instead of `Create`.  
  
##  <a name="createex"></a>  CIPAddressCtrl::CreateEx  
 Call this function to create a control (a child window) and associate it with the `CIPAddressCtrl` object.  
  
```  
virtual BOOL CreateEx(
    DWORD dwExStyle,  
    DWORD dwStyle,  
    const RECT& rect,  
    CWnd* pParentWnd,  
    UINT nID);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *dwExStyle*  
 Specifies the extended style of the control being created. For a list of extended Windows styles, see the *dwExStyle* parameter for [CreateWindowEx](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowexa) in the Windows SDK.  
  
 *dwStyle*  
 The IP Address control's style. Apply a combination of window styles. You must include the WS_CHILD style because the control must be a child window. See [CreateWindow](/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowa) in the Windows SDK for a list of windows styles.  
  
 *rect*  
 A reference to a [RECT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd162897) structure describing the size and position of the window to be created, in client coordinates of *pParentWnd*.  
  
 *pParentWnd*  
 A pointer to the window that is the control's parent.  
  
 *nID*  
 The control's child-window ID.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 Use `CreateEx` instead of [Create](#create) to apply extended Windows styles, specified by the Windows extended style preface **WS_EX_**.  
  
##  <a name="getaddress"></a>  CIPAddressCtrl::GetAddress  
 Retrieves the address values for all four fields in the IP Address Control.  
  
```  
int GetAddress(
    BYTE& nField0,  
    BYTE& nField1,  
    BYTE& nField2,  
    BYTE& nField3);
