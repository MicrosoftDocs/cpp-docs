# Dialog Data Exchange Functions for CRecordView and CDaoRecordView
This topic lists the DDX_Field functions used to exchange data between a [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) and a [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) form or a [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md) and a [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) form.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  DDX_Field functions are like DDX functions in that they exchange data with controls in a form. But unlike DDX, they exchange data with the fields of the view's associated recordset object rather than with fields of the record view itself. For more information, see classes `CRecordView` and `CDaoRecordView`.  
  
### DDX_Field Functions  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[DDX_FieldCBIndex](#ddx_fieldcbindex)|Transfers integer data between a recordset field data member and the index of the current selection in a combo box in a [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) or [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md).|  
|[DDX_FieldCBString](#ddx_fieldcbstring)|Transfers `CString` data between a recordset field data member and the edit control of a combo box in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`. When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function selects the item in the combo box that begins with the characters in the specified string.|  
|[DDX_FieldCBStringExact](#ddx_fieldcbstringexact)|Transfers `CString` data between a recordset field data member and the edit control of a combo box in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`. When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function selects the item in the combo box that exactly matches the specified string.|  
|[DDX_FieldCheck](#ddx_fieldcheck)|Transfers Boolean data between a recordset field data member and a check box in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`.|  
|[DDX_FieldLBIndex](#ddx_fieldlbindex)|Transfers integer data between a recordset field data member and the index of the current selection in a list box in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`.|  
|[DDX_FieldLBString](#ddx_fieldlbstring)|Manages the transfer of [CString](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md) data between a list-box control and the field data members of a recordset. When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function selects the item in the list box that begins with the characters in the specified string.|  
|[DDX_FieldLBStringExact](#ddx_fieldlbstringexact)|Manages the transfer of `CString` data between a list-box control and the field data members of a recordset. When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function selects the first item that exactly matches the specified string.|  
|[DDX_FieldRadio](#ddx_fieldradio)|Transfers integer data between a recordset field data member and a group of radio buttons in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`.|  
|[DDX_FieldScroll](#ddx_fieldscroll)|Sets or gets the scroll position of a scroll bar control in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`. Call from your [DoFieldExchange](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md#dofieldexchange) function.|  
|[DDX_FieldSlider](#ddx_fieldslider)|Synchronizes the thumb position of a slider control in a record view and an `int` field data member of a recordset. |
|[DDX_FieldText](#ddx_fieldtext)|Overloaded versions are available for transferring `int`, **UINT**, **long**, `DWORD`, [CString](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md), **float**, **double**, **short**, [COleDateTime](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetime-class.md), and [COleCurrency](../../mfc/reference/colecurrency-class.md) data between a recordset field data member and an edit box in a `CRecordView` or `CDaoRecordView`.|  
  
##  <a name="ddx_fieldcbindex"></a>  DDX_FieldCBIndex  
 The `DDX_FieldCBIndex` function synchronizes the index of the selected item in the list box control of a combo box control in a record view and an `int` field data member of a recordset associated with the record view.  
  
```  
void AFXAPI DDX_FieldCBIndex(
    CDataExchange* pDX,    
    int nIDC,   
    int& index,  
    CRecordset* pRecordset);

void AFXAPI DDX_FieldCBIndex(
    CDataExchange* pDX,    
    int nIDC,   
    int& index,  
    CDaoRecordset* pRecordset);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pDX*  
 A pointer to a [CDataExchange](../../mfc/reference/cdataexchange-class.md) object. The framework supplies this object to establish the context of the data exchange, including its direction.  
  
 *nIDC*  
 The ID of a control in the [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) or [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) object.  
  
 *index*  
 A reference to a field data member in the associated `CRecordset` or `CDaoRecordset` object.  
  
 *pRecordset*  
 A pointer to the [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) or [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md) object with which data is exchanged.  
  
### Remarks  
 When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function sets the selection in the control based on the value specified in *index*. On a transfer from the recordset to the control, if the recordset field is Null, MFC sets the value of the index to 0. On a transfer from control to recordset, if the control is empty or if no item is selected, the recordset field is set to 0.  
  
 Use the first version if you are working with the ODBC-based classes. Use the second version if you are working with the DAO-based classes.  
  
 For more information about DDX, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md). For examples and more information about DDX for [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) and [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) fields, see the article [Record Views](../../data/record-views-mfc-data-access.md).  
  
### Example  
 See [DDX_FieldText](#ddx_fieldtext) for a general DDX_Field example. The example would be similar for `DDX_FieldCBIndex`.

 The `DDX_FieldCBString` function manages the transfer of [CString](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md) data between the edit control of a combo box control in a record view and a `CString` field data member of a recordset associated with the record view.  
  
```  
void AFXAPI DDX_FieldCBString(
    CDataExchange* pDX,    
    int nIDC,   
    CString& value,   
    CRecordset* pRecordset);

void AFXAPI DDX_FieldCBString(
    CDataExchange* pDX,    
    int nIDC,   
    CString& value,   
    CDaoRecordset* pRecordset);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pDX*  
 A pointer to a [CDataExchange](../../mfc/reference/cdataexchange-class.md) object. The framework supplies this object to establish the context of the data exchange, including its direction.  
  
 *nIDC*  
 The ID of a control in the [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) or [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) object.

 *pRecordset*  
 A pointer to the [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) or [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md) object with which data is exchanged.  
  
### Remarks  
 When moving data from the recordset to the control, this function sets the scroll position of the scroll bar control to the value specified in *value*. On a transfer from the recordset to the control, if the recordset field is Null, the scroll bar control is set to 0. On a transfer from control to recordset, if the control is empty, the value of the recordset field is 0.  
  
 Use the first version if you are working with the ODBC-based classes. Use the second version if you are working with the DAO-based classes.

  ## name="ddx_fieldslider"></a>  DDX_FieldSlider
The `DDX_FieldSlider` function synchronizes the thumb position of a slider control in a record view and an **int** field data member of a recordset associated with the record view (or with whatever integer variable you choose to map it to).  
   
### Syntax  
  ```
   void AFXAPI DDX_FieldSlider(  
       CDataExchange* pDX,  
       int nIDC,  
       int& value,  
       CRecordset* pRecordset );  

void AFXAPI DDX_FieldSlider(  
     CDataExchange* pDX,  
     int nIDC,  
     int& value,  
     CDaoRecordset* pRecordset );  
```
### Parameters  
 *pDX*  
 A pointer to a [CDataExchange](cdataexchange-class.md) object. The framework supplies this object to establish the context of the data exchange, including its direction.  
  
 *nIDC*  
 The resource ID of the slider control.  
  
 *value*  
 A reference to the value to be exchanged. This parameter holds or will be used to set the slider control's current thumb position.  
  
 *pRecordset*  
 A pointer to the associated `CRecordset` or `CDaoRecordset` object with which data is exchanged.  
   
### Remarks  
 When moving data from the recordset to the slider, this function sets the position of the slider to the value specified in *value*. On a transfer from the recordset to the control, if the recordset field is Null, the slider control's position is set to 0. On a transfer from the control to the recordset, if the control is empty, the value of the recordset field is 0.  
  
 `DDX_FieldSlider` does not exchange range information with slider controls capable of setting a range rather than simply a position.  
  
 Use the first override of the function if you are working with the ODBC-based classes. Use the second override with the DAO-based classes.

```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pDX*  
 A pointer to a [CDataExchange](../../mfc/reference/cdataexchange-class.md) object. The framework supplies this object to establish the context of the data exchange, including its direction.  
  
 *nIDC*  
 The ID of a control in the [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) or [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) object.  
  
 *value*  
 A reference to a field data member in the associated `CRecordset` or `CDaoRecordset` object. The data type of value depends on which of the overloaded versions of `DDX_FieldText` you use.  
  
 *pRecordset*  
 A pointer to the [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) or [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md) object with which data is exchanged. This pointer enables `DDX_FieldText` to detect and set Null values.  
  
### Remarks  
 For [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md) objects, `DDX_FieldText` also manages transferring [COleDateTime](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetime-class.md), and [COleCurrency](../../mfc/reference/colecurrency-class.md) values. An empty edit box control indicates a Null value. On a transfer from the recordset to the control, if the recordset field is Null, the edit box is set to empty. On a transfer from control to recordset, if the control is empty, the recordset field is set to Null.  
  
 Use the versions with [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) parameters if you are working with the ODBC-based classes. Use the versions with [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md) parameters if you are working with the DAO-based classes.  
  
 For more information about DDX, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md). For examples and more information about DDX for [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) and [CDaoRecordView](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordview-class.md) fields, see the article [Record Views](../../data/record-views-mfc-data-access.md).  
  
### Example  
 The following `DoDataExchange` function for a [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) contains `DDX_FieldText` function calls for three data types: `IDC_COURSELIST` is a combo box; the other two controls are edit boxes. For DAO programming, the *m_pSet* parameter is a pointer to a [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) or [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md).
