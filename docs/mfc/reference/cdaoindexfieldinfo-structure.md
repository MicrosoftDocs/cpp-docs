# CDaoIndexFieldInfo Structure

The `CDaoIndexFieldInfo` structure contains information about an index field object defined for data access objects (DAO).

> [!NOTE]
> DAO is supported through Office 2013. DAO 3.6 is the final version, and it's considered obsolete.

## Syntax

```
struct CDaoIndexFieldInfo
{
    CString m_strName;          // Primary
    BOOL m_bDescending;         // Primary
};
```

#### Parameters

*m_strName*<br/>
Uniquely names the index field object. For details, see the topic "Name Property" in DAO Help.

*m_bDescending*<br/>
Indicates the index ordering defined by the index object. TRUE if the order is descending.

## Remarks

An index object can have a number of fields, indicating which fields a tabledef (or a recordset based on a table) is indexed on. The references to Primary above indicate how the information is returned in the `m_pFieldInfos` member of a [CDaoIndexInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaoindexinfo-structure.md) object obtained by calling the `GetIndexInfo` member function of class [CDaoTableDef](../../mfc/reference/cdaotabledef-class.md#getindexinfo) or [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md#getindexinfo).

Index objects and index field objects are not represented by an MFC class. Instead, the DAO objects underlying MFC objects of class [CDaoTableDef](../../mfc/reference/cdaotabledef-class.md) or [CDaoRecordset](../../mfc/reference/cdaorecordset-class.md) contain a collection of index objects, called the Indexes collection. Each index object, in turn, contains a collection of field objects. These classes supply member functions to access individual items of index information, or you can access them all at once with a `CDaoIndexInfo` object by calling the `GetIndexInfo` member function of the containing object. The `CDaoIndexInfo` object, then, has a data member, `m_pFieldInfos`, that points to an array of `CDaoIndexFieldInfo` objects.

Call the `GetIndexInfo` member function of the containing tabledef or recordset object in whose Indexes collection is stored the index object you are interested in. Then access the `m_pFieldInfos` member of the [CDaoIndexInfo](../../mfc/reference/cdaoindexinfo-structure.md) object. The length of the `m_pFieldInfos` array is stored in `m_nFields`. `CDaoIndexFieldInfo` also defines a `Dump` member function in debug builds. You can use `Dump` to dump the contents of a `CDaoIndexFieldInfo` object.
