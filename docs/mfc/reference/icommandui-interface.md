# ICommandUI Interface
Manages user interface commands.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
interface class ICommandUI  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[icommandui__Check](#check)|Sets the user interface item for this command to the appropriate check state.|  
|[ICommandUI::ContinueRouting](#continuerouting)|Tells the command-routing mechanism to continue routing the current message down the chain of handlers.|  
|[ICommandUI::Enabled](#enabled)|Enables or disables the user interface item for this command.|  
|[ICommandUI::ID](#id)|Gets the ID of the user interface object represented by the `ICommandUI` object.|  
|[ICommandUI::Index](#index)|Gets the index of the user interface object represented by the `ICommandUI` object.|  
|[ICommandUI::Radio](#radio)|Sets the user interface item for this command to the appropriate check state.|  
|[ICommandUI::Text](#text)|Sets the text of the user interface item for this command.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This interface provides methods and properties that manage user interface commands. `ICommandUI` is similar to [CCmdUI Class](../../mfc/reference/ccmdui-class.md), except that `ICommandUI` is used for MFC applications that interoperate with .NET components.  
  
 `ICommandUI` is used within an ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI handler in an [ICommandTarget](../../mfc/reference/icommandtarget-interface.md)-derived class. When a user of an application activates (selects or clicks) a menu, each menu item is displayed as enabled or disabled. The target of each menu command provides this information by implementing an ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI handler. For each of the command user interface objects in your application, use the Properties window to create a message-map entry and function prototype for each handler.  
  
 For more information on how the `ICommandUI` interface is used in command routing, see [How to: Add Command Routing to the Windows Forms Control](../../dotnet/how-to-add-command-routing-to-the-windows-forms-control.md).  
  
 For more information on using Windows Forms, see [Using a Windows Form User Control in MFC](../../dotnet/using-a-windows-form-user-control-in-mfc.md).  
  
 For more information on how user interface commands are managed in MFC, see [CCmdUI Class](../../mfc/reference/ccmdui-class.md).  
  
## <a name="check"></a> ICommandUI::Check  
Sets the user interface item for this command to the appropriate check state.
```
property UICheckState Check;
```
## Remarks  
This property sets the user interface item for this command to the appropriate check state. Set Check to the following values:  
- 0 Uncheck  
- 1 Check  
- 2 Set indeterminate  

## <a name="continuerouting"></a> ICommandUI::ContinueRouting   
Tells the command routing mechanism to continue routing the current message down the chain of handlers.
```
void ContinueRouting();
```
## Remarks
This is an advanced member function that should be used in conjunction with an ON_COMMAND_EX handler that returns FALSE. For more information, see Technical Note TN006: Message Maps.

## <a name="enabled"></a> ICommandUI::Enabled 
Enables or disables the user interface item for this command.
```
property bool Enabled;
```
## Remarks
This property enables or disables the user interface item for this command. Set Enabled to TRUE to enable the item, FALSE to disable it.

## <a name="id"></a> ICommandUI::ID  
Gets the ID of the user interface object represented by the ICommandUI object.
```
property unsigned int ID;
```
## Remarks
This property gets the ID (a handle) of the menu item, toolbar button, or other user interface object represented by the ICommandUI object.

## <a name="index"></a> ICommandUI::Index   
Gets the index of the user interface object represented by the ICommandUI object.
```
property unsigned int Index;
```
## Remarks
This property gets the index (a handle) of the menu item, toolbar button, or other user interface object represented by the ICommandUI object.

## <a name="radio"></a> ICommandUI::Radio 
Sets the user interface item for this command to the appropriate check state.
```
property bool Radio;
```
## Remarks
This property sets the user interface item for this command to the appropriate check state. Set Radio to TRUE to enable the item; otherwise FALSE.

## <a name="text"></a> ICommandUI::Text 
Sets the text of the user interface item for this command.
```
property String^ Text;
```
## Remarks
This property sets the text of the user interface item for this command. Set Text to a text string handle.

## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxwinforms.h (defined in assembly atlmfc\lib\mfcmifc80.dll)
