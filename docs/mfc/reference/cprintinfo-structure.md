## Remarks  
 `CPrintInfo` is a structure and does not have a base class.  
  
 The framework creates an object of `CPrintInfo` each time the Print or Print Preview command is chosen and destroys it when the command is completed.  
  
 `CPrintInfo` contains information about both the print job as a whole, such as the range of pages to be printed, and the current status of the print job, such as the page currently being printed. Some information is stored in an associated [CPrintDialog](../../mfc/reference/cprintdialog-class.md) object; this object contains the values entered by the user in the Print dialog box.  
  
 A `CPrintInfo` object is passed between the framework and your view class during the printing process and is used to exchange information between the two. For example, the framework informs the view class which page of the document to print by assigning a value to the `m_nCurPage` member of `CPrintInfo`; the view class retrieves the value and performs the actual printing of the specified page.  
  
 Another example is the case in which the length of the document is not known until it is printed. In this situation, the view class tests for the end of the document each time a page is printed. When the end is reached, the view class sets the `m_bContinuePrinting` member of `CPrintInfo` to FALSE; this informs the framework to stop the print loop.  
  
 `CPrintInfo` is used by the member functions of `CView` listed under "See Also." For more information about the printing architecture provided by the Microsoft Foundation Class Library, see [Frame Windows](../../mfc/frame-windows.md) and [Document/View Architecture](../../mfc/document-view-architecture.md) and the articles [Printing](../../mfc/printing.md) and [Printing: Multipage Documents](../../mfc/multipage-documents.md).  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 `CPrintInfo`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxext.h  
  
##  <a name="getfrompage"></a>  CPrintInfo::GetFromPage  
 Call this function to retrieve the number of the first page to be printed.  
  
```  
UINT GetFromPage() const;

 
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The number of the first page to be printed.  
  
### Remarks  
 This is the value specified by the user in the Print dialog box, and it is stored in the `CPrintDialog` object referenced by the `m_pPD` member. If the user has not specified a value, the default is the first page of the document.  
  
##  <a name="getmaxpage"></a>  CPrintInfo::GetMaxPage  
 Call this function to retrieve the number of the last page of the document.  
  
```  
UINT GetMaxPage() const;

 
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The number of the last page of the document.  
  
### Remarks  
 This value is stored in the `CPrintDialog` object referenced by the `m_pPD` member.  
  
##  <a name="getminpage"></a>  CPrintInfo::GetMinPage  
 Call this function to retrieve the number of the first page of the document.  
  
```  
UINT GetMinPage() const;

 
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The number of the first page of the document.  
  
### Remarks  
 This value is stored in the `CPrintDialog` object referenced by the `m_pPD` member.  
  
##  <a name="getoffsetpage"></a>  CPrintInfo::GetOffsetPage  
 Call this function to retrieve the offset when printing multiple DocObject items from a DocObject client.  
  
```  
UINT GetOffsetPage() const;

 
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The number of pages preceding the first page of a DocObject item being printed in a combined DocObject print job.  
  
### Remarks  
 This value is referenced by the `m_nOffsetPage` member. The first page of your document will be numbered the `m_nOffsetPage` value + 1 when printed as a DocObject with other active documents. The `m_nOffsetPage` member is valid only if the `m_bDocObject` value is TRUE.  
  
##  <a name="gettopage"></a>  CPrintInfo::GetToPage  
 Call this function to retrieve the number of the last page to be printed.  
  
```  
UINT GetToPage() const;

 
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The number of the last page to be printed.  
  
### Remarks  
 This is the value specified by the user in the Print dialog box, and it is stored in the `CPrintDialog` object referenced by the `m_pPD` member. If the user has not specified a value, the default is the last page of the document.  
  
##  <a name="m_bcontinueprinting"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_bContinuePrinting  
 Contains a flag indicating whether the framework should continue the print loop.  
  
### Remarks  
 If you are doing print-time pagination, you can set this member to FALSE in your override of `CView::OnPrepareDC` once the end of the document has been reached. You do not have to modify this variable if you have specified the length of the document at the beginning of the print job using the `SetMaxPage` member function. The `m_bContinuePrinting` member is a public variable of type BOOL.  
  
##  <a name="m_bdirect"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_bDirect  
 The framework sets this member to TRUE if the Print dialog box will be bypassed for direct printing; FALSE otherwise.  
  
### Remarks  
 The Print dialog is normally bypassed when you print from the shell or when printing is done using the command ID ID_FILE_PRINT_DIRECT.  
  
 You normally don't change this member, but if you do change it, change it before you call [CView::DoPreparePrinting](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#doprepareprinting) in your override of [CView::OnPreparePrinting](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#onprepareprinting).  
  
##  <a name="m_bdocobject"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_bDocObject  
 Contains a flag indicating whether the document being printed is a DocObject.  
  
### Remarks  
 Data members `m_dwFlags` and `m_nOffsetPage` are invalid unless this flag is TRUE.  
  
##  <a name="m_bpreview"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_bPreview  
 Contains a flag indicating whether the document is being previewed.  
  
### Remarks  
 This is set by the framework depending on which command the user executed. The Print dialog box is not displayed for a print-preview job. The `m_bPreview` member is a public variable of type BOOL.  
  
##  <a name="m_dwflags"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_dwFlags  
 Contains a combination of flags specifying DocObject printing operations.  
  
### Remarks  
 Valid only if data member `m_bDocObject` is TRUE.  
  
 The flags can be one or more of the following values:  
  
- PRINTFLAG_MAYBOTHERUSER  
  
- PRINTFLAG_PROMPTUSER  
  
- PRINTFLAG_USERMAYCHANGEPRINTER  
  
- PRINTFLAG_RECOMPOSETODEVICE  
  
- PRINTFLAG_DONTACTUALLYPRINT  
  
- PRINTFLAG_FORCEPROPERTIES  
  
- PRINTFLAG_PRINTTOFILE  
  
##  <a name="m_lpuserdata"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_lpUserData  
 Contains a pointer to a user-created structure.  
  
### Remarks  
 You can use this to store printing-specific data that you do not want to store in your view class. The `m_lpUserData` member is a public variable of type LPVOID.  
  
##  <a name="m_ncurpage"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_nCurPage  
 Contains the number of the current page.  
  
### Remarks  
 The framework calls `CView::OnPrepareDC` and `CView::OnPrint` once for each page of the document, specifying a different value for this member each time; its values range from the value returned by `GetFromPage` to that returned by `GetToPage`. Use this member in your overrides of `CView::OnPrepareDC` and `CView::OnPrint` to print the specified page of the document.  
  
 When preview mode is first invoked, the framework reads the value of this member to determine which page of the document should be previewed initially. You can set the value of this member in your override of `CView::OnPreparePrinting` to maintain the user's current position in the document when entering preview mode. The `m_nCurPage` member is a public variable of type UINT.  
  
##  <a name="m_njobnumber"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_nJobNumber  
 Indicates the job number assigned by the operating system for the current print job.  
  
### Remarks  
 This value may be SP_ERROR if the job hasn't yet printed (that is, if the `CPrintInfo` object is newly constructed and has not yet been used to print), or if there was an error in starting the job.  
  
##  <a name="m_nnumpreviewpages"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_nNumPreviewPages  
 Contains the number of pages displayed in preview mode; it can be either 1 or 2.  
  
### Remarks  
 The `m_nNumPreviewPages` member is a public variable of type UINT.  
  
##  <a name="m_noffsetpage"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_nOffsetPage  
 Contains the number of pages preceding the first page of a particular DocObject in a combined DocObject print job.  
  
##  <a name="m_ppd"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_pPD  
 Contains a pointer to the `CPrintDialog` object used to display the Print dialog box for the print job.  
  
### Remarks  
 The `m_pPD` member is a public variable declared as a pointer to `CPrintDialog`.  
  
##  <a name="m_rectdraw"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_rectDraw  
 Specifies the usable drawing area of the page in logical coordinates.  
  
### Remarks  
 You may want to refer to this in your override of `CView::OnPrint`. You can use this member to keep track of what area remains usable after you print headers, footers, and so on. The `m_rectDraw` member is a public variable of type `CRect`.  
  
##  <a name="m_strpagedesc"></a>  CPrintInfo::m_strPageDesc  
 Contains a format string used to display the page numbers during print preview; this string consists of two substrings, one for single-page display and one for double-page display, each terminated by a '\n' character.  
  
### Remarks  
 The framework uses "Page %u\nPages %u-%u\n" as the default value. If you want a different format for the page numbers, specify a format string in your override of `CView::OnPreparePrinting`. The `m_strPageDesc` member is a public variable of type `CString`.  
  
##  <a name="setmaxpage"></a>  CPrintInfo::SetMaxPage  
 Call this function to specify the number of the last page of the document.  
  
```  
void SetMaxPage(UINT nMaxPage);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *nMaxPage*  
 Number of the last page of the document.  
  
### Remarks  
 This value is stored in the `CPrintDialog` object referenced by the `m_pPD` member. If the length of the document is known before it is printed, call this function from your override of `CView::OnPreparePrinting`. If the length of the document depends on a setting specified by the user in the Print dialog box, call this function from your override of `CView::OnBeginPrinting`. If the length of the document is not known until it is printed, use the `m_bContinuePrinting` member to control the print loop.  
  
### Example  
  See the example for [CView::OnPreparePrinting](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md#onprepareprinting).  
  
##  <a name="setminpage"></a>  CPrintInfo::SetMinPage  
 Call this function to specify the number of the first page of the document.  
  
```  
void SetMinPage(UINT nMinPage);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *nMinPage*  
 Number of the first page of the document.  
  
### Remarks  
 Page numbers normally start at 1. This value is stored in the `CPrintDialog` object referenced by the `m_pPD` member.
