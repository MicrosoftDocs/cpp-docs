# CMemoryState Structure
Provides a convenient way to detect memory leaks in your program.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
struct CMemoryState  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CMemoryState::CMemoryState](#cmemorystate)|Constructs a class-like structure that controls memory checkpoints.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CMemoryState::Checkpoint](#checkpoint)|Obtains a snapshot (checkpoint) of the current memory state.|  
|[CMemoryState::Difference](#difference)|Computes the difference between two objects of type `CMemoryState`.|  
|[CMemoryState::DumpAllObjectsSince](#dumpallobjectssince)|Dumps a summary of all currently allocated objects since a previous checkpoint.|  
|[CMemoryState::DumpStatistics](#dumpstatistics)|Prints memory allocation statistics for a `CMemoryState` object.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `CMemoryState` is a structure and does not have a base class.  
  
 A "memory leak" occurs when memory for an object is allocated on the heap but not deallocated when it is no longer required. Such memory leaks can eventually lead to out-of-memory errors. There are several ways to allocate and deallocate memory in your program:  
  
-   Using the `malloc`/ `free` family of functions from the run-time library.  
  
-   Using the Windows API memory management functions, `LocalAlloc`/ `LocalFree` and `GlobalAlloc`/ `GlobalFree`.  
  
-   Using the C++ **new** and **delete** operators.  
  
 The `CMemoryState` diagnostics only help detect memory leaks caused when memory allocated using the **new** operator is not deallocated using **delete**. The other two groups of memory-management functions are for non-C++ programs, and mixing them with **new** and **delete** in the same program is not recommended. An additional macro, DEBUG_NEW, is provided to replace the **new** operator when you need file and line-number tracking of memory allocations. DEBUG_NEW is used whenever you would normally use the **new** operator.  
  
 As with other diagnostics, the `CMemoryState` diagnostics are only available in debug versions of your program. A debug version must have the _DEBUG constant defined.  
  
 If you suspect your program has a memory leak, you can use the `Checkpoint`, `Difference`, and `DumpStatistics` functions to discover the difference between the memory state (objects allocated) at two different points in program execution. This information can be useful in determining whether a function is cleaning up all the objects it allocates.  
  
 If simply knowing where the imbalance in allocation and deallocation occurs does not provide enough information, you can use the `DumpAllObjectsSince` function to dump all objects allocated since the previous call to `Checkpoint`. This dump shows the order of allocation, the source file and line where the object was allocated (if you are using DEBUG_NEW for allocation), and the derivation of the object, its address, and its size. `DumpAllObjectsSince` also calls each object's `Dump` function to provide information about its current state.  
  
 For more information about how to use `CMemoryState` and other diagnostics, see [Debugging MFC Applications](/visualstudio/debugger/mfc-debugging-techniques).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Declarations of objects of type `CMemoryState` and calls to member functions should be bracketed by `#if defined(_DEBUG)/#endif` directives. This causes memory diagnostics to be included only in debugging builds of your program.  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 `CMemoryState`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afx.h  
  
##  <a name="checkpoint"></a>  CMemoryState::Checkpoint  
 Takes a snapshot summary of memory and stores it in this `CMemoryState` object.  
  
```  
void Checkpoint();
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The `CMemoryState` member functions [Difference](#difference) and [DumpAllObjectsSince](#dumpallobjectssince) use this snapshot data.  
  
### Example  
  See the example for the [CMemoryState](#cmemorystate) constructor.  
  
##  <a name="cmemorystate"></a>  CMemoryState::CMemoryState  
 Constructs an empty `CMemoryState` object that must be filled in by the [Checkpoint](#checkpoint) or [Difference](#difference) member function.  
  
```  
CMemoryState();
```  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_Utilities#18](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cmemorystate-structure_1.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="difference"></a>  CMemoryState::Difference  
 Compares two `CMemoryState` objects, then stores the difference into this `CMemoryState` object.  
  
```  
BOOL Difference(
    const CMemoryState& oldState,   
    const CMemoryState& newState);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *oldState*  
 The initial memory state as defined by a `CMemoryState` checkpoint.  
  
 *newState*  
 The new memory state as defined by a `CMemoryState` checkpoint.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if the two memory states are different; otherwise 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 [Checkpoint](#checkpoint) must have been called for each of the two memory-state parameters.  
  
### Example  
  See the example for the [CMemoryState](#cmemorystate) constructor.  
  
##  <a name="dumpallobjectssince"></a>  CMemoryState::DumpAllObjectsSince  
 Calls the `Dump` function for all objects of a type derived from class `CObject` that were allocated (and are still allocated) since the last [Checkpoint](#checkpoint) call for this `CMemoryState` object.  
  
```  
void DumpAllObjectsSince() const;

 
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Calling `DumpAllObjectsSince` with an uninitialized `CMemoryState` object will dump out all objects currently in memory.  
  
### Example  
  See the example for the [CMemoryState](#cmemorystate) constructor.  
  
##  <a name="dumpstatistics"></a>  CMemoryState::DumpStatistics  
 Prints a concise memory statistics report from a `CMemoryState` object that is filled by the [Difference](#difference) member function.  
  
```  
void DumpStatistics() const;

 
```  
  
### Remarks  
 The report, which is printed on the [afxDump](diagnostic-services.md#afxdump) device, shows the following:  
  
 A sample report gives information on the number (or amount) of:  
  
-   free blocks  
  
-   normal blocks  
  
-   CRT blocks  
  
-   ignore blocks  
  
-   client blocks  
  
-   maximum memory used by the program at any one time (in bytes)  
  
-   total memory currently used by the program (in bytes)  
  
 Free blocks are the number of blocks whose deallocation was delayed if `afxMemDF` was set to `delayFreeMemDF`. For more information, see [afxMemDF](diagnostic-services.md#afxmemdf), in the "MFC Macros and Globals" section. See [Types of Blocks on the Debug Heap](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/db2e7f62-0679-4b39-a23f-26f2c2f407c5) for more information on these block types.  
  
### Example  
  The following code should be placed in *projname*App.cpp. Define the following global variables:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_Utilities#40](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cmemorystate-structure_2.cpp)]  
  
 In the `InitInstance` function, add the line:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_Utilities#41](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cmemorystate-structure_3.cpp)]  
  
 Add a handler for the `ExitInstance` function and use the following code:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_Utilities#42](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cmemorystate-structure_4.cpp)]  
  
 You can now run the program in Debug mode to see the output of the `DumpStatistics` function.
