# Creating an MFC DLL Project
An MFC DLL is a binary file that acts as a shared library of functions that can be used simultaneously by multiple applications. The easiest way to create an MFC DLL project is to use the MFC DLL Wizard.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The appearance of features in the IDE can depend on your active settings or edition, and might differ from those described in Help. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  
  
### To create an MFC DLL Project using the MFC DLL Wizard  
  
1.  Follow the instructions in the help topic [Creating a Project with a Visual C++ Application Wizard](../../ide/creating-desktop-projects-by-using-application-wizards.md).  
  
 **Note** In the **New Project** dialog box, select the `MFC DLL` icon in the Templates pane to open the MFC DLL Wizard.  
  
1.  Define your application settings using the [application settings](../../mfc/reference/application-settings-mfc-dll-wizard.md) page of the [MFC DLL Wizard](../../mfc/reference/mfc-dll-wizard.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Skip this step to keep the wizard default settings.  
  
2.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard and open your new project in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
 Once your project is created, you can view the files created in the Solution Explorer. For more information about the files the wizard creates for your project, see the project-generated file ReadMe.txt. For more information about the file types, see [File Types Created for Visual C++ Projects](../../ide/file-types-created-for-visual-cpp-projects.md).
