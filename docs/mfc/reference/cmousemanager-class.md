# CMouseManager Class
Allows a user to associate different commands with a particular [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md) object when the user double-clicks inside that view.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class CMouseManager : public CObject  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CMouseManager::AddView](#addview)|Adds a `CView` object to the **Customization** dialog box. The **Customization** dialog box enables the user to associate a double-click with a command for each of the listed views.|  
|[CMouseManager::GetViewDblClickCommand](#getviewdblclickcommand)|Returns the command that is executed when the user double-clicks inside the provided view.|  
|[CMouseManager::GetViewIconId](#getviewiconid)|Returns the icon associated with the provided view ID.|  
|[CMouseManager::GetViewIdByName](#getviewidbyname)|Returns the view ID associated with the provided view name.|  
|[CMouseManager::GetViewNames](#getviewnames)|Retrieves a list of all added view names.|  
|[CMouseManager::LoadState](#loadstate)|Loads the `CMouseManager` state from the Windows registry.|  
|[CMouseManager::SaveState](#savestate)|Writes the `CMouseManager` state to the Windows registry.|  
|[CMouseManager::SetCommandForDblClk](#setcommandfordblclk)|Associates the provided command and the provided view.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `CMouseManager` class maintains a collection of `CView` objects. Each view is identified by a name and by an ID. These views are shown in the **Customization** dialog box. The user can change the command that is associated with any view through the **Customization** dialog box. The associated command is executed when the user double-clicks in that view. To support this from a coding perspective, you must process the WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK message and call the [CWinAppEx::OnViewDoubleClick](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md#onviewdoubleclick) function in the code for that `CView` object..  
  
 You should not create a `CMouseManager` object manually. It will be created by the framework of your application. It will also be destroyed automatically when the user exits the application. To get a pointer to the mouse manager for your application, call [CWinAppEx::GetMouseManager](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md#getmousemanager).  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 [CObject](../../mfc/reference/cobject-class.md)  
  
 `CMouseManager`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxmousemanager.h  
  
##  <a name="addview"></a>  CMouseManager::AddView  
 Registers a [CView](../../mfc/reference/cview-class.md) object with the [CMouseManager Class](../../mfc/reference/cmousemanager-class.md) to support custom mouse behavior.  
  
```  
BOOL AddView(
    int iViewId,  
    UINT uiViewNameResId,  
    UINT uiIconId = 0);

 
BOOL AddView(
    int iId,  
    LPCTSTR lpszViewName,  
    UINT uiIconId = 0);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 [in] *iViewId*  
 A view ID.  
  
 [in] *uiViewNameResId*  
 A resource string ID that references the view name.  
  
 [in] *uiIconId*  
 A view icon ID.  
  
 [in] *iId*  
 A view ID.  
  
 [in] *lpszViewName*  
 A view name.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 In order to support custom mouse behavior, a view must be registered with the `CMouseManager` object. Any object derived from the `CView` class can be registered with the mouse manager. The string and icon associated with a view are displayed in the **Mouse** tab of the **Customize** dialog box.  
  
 It is the responsibility of the programmer to create and maintain view IDs such as *iViewId* and *iId*.  
  
 For more information about how to provide custom mouse behavior, see [Keyboard and Mouse Customization](../../mfc/keyboard-and-mouse-customization.md).  
  
### Example  
 The following example demonstrates how to retrieve a pointer to a `CMouseManager` object by using the `CWinAppEx::GetMouseManager` method and the `AddView` method in the `CMouseManager` class. This code snippet is part of the [State Collection sample](../../visual-cpp-samples.md).  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFC_StateCollection#4](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/cmousemanager-class_1.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="getviewdblclickcommand"></a>  CMouseManager::GetViewDblClickCommand  
 Returns the command that is executed when the user double-clicks inside the provided view.  
  
```  
UINT GetViewDblClickCommand(int iId) const;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 [in] *iId*  
 The view ID.  
  
### Return Value  
 The command identifier if the view is associated with a command; otherwise 0.  
  
##  <a name="getviewiconid"></a>  CMouseManager::GetViewIconId  
 Retrieves the icon associated with a view ID.  
  
```  
UINT GetViewIconId(int iViewId) const;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 [in] *iViewId*  
 The view ID.  
  
### Return Value  
 An icon resource identifier if successful; otherwise 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method will fail if the view is not first registered by using [CMouseManager::AddView](#addview).  
  
##  <a name="getviewidbyname"></a>  CMouseManager::GetViewIdByName  
 Retrieves the view ID associated with a view name.  
  
```  
int GetViewIdByName(LPCTSTR lpszName) const;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 [in] *lpszName*  
 The view name.  
  
### Return Value  
 A view ID if successful; otherwise 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method searches through views registered by using [CMouseManager::AddView](#addview).  
  
##  <a name="getviewnames"></a>  CMouseManager::GetViewNames  
 Retrieves a list of all the registered view names.  
  
```  
void GetViewNames(CStringList& listOfNames) const;  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 [out] *listOfNames*  
 A reference to `CStringList` object.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method fills the parameter `listOfNames` with the names of all the views registered by using [CMouseManager::AddView](#addview).  
  
##  <a name="loadstate"></a>  CMouseManager::LoadState  
 Loads the state of the [CMouseManager Class](../../mfc/reference/cmousemanager-class.md) from the registry.  
  
```  
BOOL LoadState(LPCTSTR lpszProfileName = NULL);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 [in] *lpszProfileName*  
 A path of a registry key.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 The state information loaded from the registry includes the registered views, view identifiers, and the associated commands. If the parameter *lpszProfileName* is NULL, this function loads the `CMouseManager` data from the default registry location controlled by the [CWinAppEx Class](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md).  
  
 In most cases, you do not have to call this function directly. It is called as a part of the workspace initialization process. For more information about the workspace initialization process, see [CWinAppEx::LoadState](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md#loadstate).  
  
##  <a name="savestate"></a>  CMouseManager::SaveState  
 Writes the state of the [CMouseManager Class](../../mfc/reference/cmousemanager-class.md) to the registry.  
  
```  
BOOL SaveState(LPCTSTR lpszProfileName = NULL);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 [in] *lpszProfileName*  
 A path of a registry key.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if successful; otherwise 0.  
  
### Remarks  
 The state information written to the registry includes all registered views, view identifiers, and the associated commands. If the parameter *lpszProfileName* is NULL, this function writes the `CMouseManager` data to the default registry location controlled by the [CWinAppEx Class](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md).  
  
 In most cases, you do not have to call this function directly. It is called as a part of the workspace serialization process. For more information about the workspace serialization process, see [CWinAppEx::SaveState](../../mfc/reference/cwinappex-class.md#savestate).  
  
##  <a name="setcommandfordblclk"></a>  CMouseManager::SetCommandForDblClk  
 Associates a custom command with a view that is first registered with the mouse manager.  
  
```  
void SetCommandForDblClk(
    int iViewId,  
    UINT uiCmd);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 [in] *iViewId*  
 The view identifier.  
  
 [in] *uiCmd*  
 The command identifier.  
  
### Remarks  
 In order to associate a custom command with a view, you must first register the view by using [CMouseManager::AddView](#addview). The `AddView` method requires a view identifier as an input parameter. Once you register a view, you can call `CMouseManager::SetCommandForDblClk` with the same view identifier input parameter that you supplied to `AddView`. Thereafter, when the user double-clicks the mouse in the registered view, the application will execute the command indicated by *uiCmd.* To support the custom mouse behavior, you will also need to customize the view registered with the mouse manager. For more information about custom mouse behavior, see [Keyboard and Mouse Customization](../keyboard-and-mouse-customization.md).  
  
 If *uiCmd* is set to 0, the specified view is no longer associated with a command.
