# ABC Structure
The **ABC** structure contains the width of a character in a TrueType font.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct _ABC { /* abc */  
    int abcA;  
    UINT abcB;  
    int abcC;  
} ABC;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *abcA*  
 Specifies the A spacing of the character. The A spacing is the distance to add to the current position before drawing the character glyph.  
  
 *abcB*  
 Specifies the B spacing of the character. The B spacing is the width of the drawn portion of the character glyph.  
  
 *abcC*  
 Specifies the C spacing of the character. The C spacing is the distance to add to the current position to provide white space to the right of the character glyph.  
  
## Remarks  
 The total width of a character is the summation of the A, B, and C spaces. Either the A or the C space can be negative to indicate underhangs or overhangs.
