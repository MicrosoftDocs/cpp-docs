# ABCFLOAT Structure
The `ABCFLOAT` structure contains the A, B, and C widths of a font character.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct _ABCFLOAT { /* abcf */  
    FLOAT abcfA;  
    FLOAT abcfB;  
    FLOAT abcfC;  
} ABCFLOAT;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *abcfA*  
 Specifies the A spacing of the character. The A spacing is the distance to add to the current position before drawing the character glyph.  
  
 *abcfB*  
 Specifies the B spacing of the character. The B spacing is the width of the drawn portion of the character glyph.  
  
 *abcfC*  
 Specifies the C spacing of the character. The C spacing is the distance to add to the current position to provide white space to the right of the character glyph.  
  
## Remarks  
 The A, B, and C widths are measured along the base line of the font. The character increment (total width) of a character is the sum of the A, B, and C spaces. Either the A or the C space can be negative to indicate underhangs or overhangs.  
  
## Requirements
