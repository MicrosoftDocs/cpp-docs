# CLinearTransitionFromSpeed Class

Encapsulates a linear-speed transition.

## Syntax

```
class CLinearTransitionFromSpeed : public CBaseTransition;
```

## Members

### Public Constructors

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::CLinearTransitionFromSpeed](#clineartransitionfromspeed)|Constructs a linear-speed transition object and initializes it with speed and final value.|

### Public Methods

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::Create](#create)|Calls the transition library to create encapsulated transition COM object. (Overrides [CBaseTransition::Create](../../mfc/reference/cbasetransition-class.md#create).)|

### Public Data Members

|Name|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::m_dblFinalValue](#m_dblfinalvalue)|The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.|
|[CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::m_dblSpeed](#m_dblspeed)|The absolute value of the variable's velocity.|

## Remarks

During a linear-speed transition, the value of the animation variable changes at a specified rate. The duration of the transition is determined by the difference between the initial value and the specified final value. Because all transitions are cleared automatically, it's recommended to allocated them using operator new. The encapsulated IUIAnimationTransition COM object is created by CAnimationController::AnimateGroup, until then it's NULL. Changing member variables after creation of this COM object has no effect.

## Requirements

**Header:** afxanimationcontroller.h

##  <a name="clineartransitionfromspeed"></a>  CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::CLinearTransitionFromSpeed

Constructs a linear-speed transition object and initializes it with speed and final value.

```
CLinearTransitionFromSpeed(
    DOUBLE dblSpeed,
    DOUBLE dblFinalValue);
```

### Parameters

*dblSpeed*<br/>
The absolute value of the variable's velocity.

*dblFinalValue*<br/>
The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.

##  <a name="create"></a>  CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::Create

Calls the transition library to create encapsulated transition COM object.

```
virtual BOOL Create(
    IUIAnimationTransitionLibrary* pLibrary,
    IUIAnimationTransitionFactory* \*not used*\);
```

### Parameters

*pLibrary*<br/>
A pointer to an [IUIAnimationTransitionLibrary interface](/windows/desktop/api/uianimation/nn-uianimation-iuianimationtransitionlibrary), which defines a library of standard transitions.

### Return Value

TRUE if transition is created successfully; otherwise FALSE.

##  <a name="m_dblfinalvalue"></a>  CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::m_dblFinalValue

The value of the animation variable at the end of the transition.

```
DOUBLE m_dblFinalValue;
```

##  <a name="m_dblspeed"></a>  CLinearTransitionFromSpeed::m_dblSpeed

The absolute value of the variable's velocity.

```
DOUBLE m_dblSpeed;
```
