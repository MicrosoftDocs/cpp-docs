## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 `CD2DGeometrySink`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxrendertarget.h  
  
##  <a name="_dtorcd2dgeometrysink"></a>  CD2DGeometrySink::~CD2DGeometrySink  
 The destructor. Called when a D2D geometry sink object is being destroyed.  
  
```  
virtual ~CD2DGeometrySink();
```  
  
##  <a name="addarc"></a>  CD2DGeometrySink::AddArc  
 Adds a single arc to the path geometry  
  
```  
void AddArc(const D2D1_ARC_SEGMENT& arc);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *arc*  
 The arc segment to add to the figure  
  
##  <a name="addbezier"></a>  CD2DGeometrySink::AddBezier  
 Creates a cubic Bezier curve between the current point and the specified end point.  
  
```  
void AddBezier(const D2D1_BEZIER_SEGMENT& bezier);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *bezier*  
 A structure that describes the control points and end point of the Bezier curve to add.  
  
##  <a name="addbeziers"></a>  CD2DGeometrySink::AddBeziers  
 Creates a sequence of cubic Bezier curves and adds them to the geometry sink.  
  
```  
void AddBeziers(
    const CArray<D2D1_BEZIER_SEGMENT,  
    D2D1_BEZIER_SEGMENT>& beziers);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *beziers*  
 An array of Bezier segments that describes the Bezier curves to create. A curve is drawn from the geometry sink's current point (the end point of the last segment drawn or the location specified by BeginFigure) to the end point of the first Bezier segment in the array. if the array contains additional Bezier segments, each subsequent Bezier segment uses the end point of the preceding Bezier segment as its start point.  
  
##  <a name="addline"></a>  CD2DGeometrySink::AddLine  
 Creates a line segment between the current point and the specified end point and adds it to the geometry sink.  
  
```  
void AddLine(CD2DPointF point);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *point*  
 The end point of the line to draw.  
  
##  <a name="addlines"></a>  CD2DGeometrySink::AddLines  
 Creates a sequence of lines using the specified points and adds them to the geometry sink.  
  
```  
void AddLines(
    const CArray<CD2DPointF,  
    CD2DPointF>& points);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *points*  
 An array of one or more points that describe the lines to draw. A line is drawn from the geometry sink's current point (the end point of the last segment drawn or the location specified by BeginFigure) to the first point in the array. if the array contains additional points, a line is drawn from the first point to the second point in the array, from the second point to the third point, and so on. An array of a sequence of the end points of the lines to draw.  
  
##  <a name="addquadraticbezier"></a>  CD2DGeometrySink::AddQuadraticBezier  
 Creates a quadratic Bezier curve between the current point and the specified end point.  
  
```  
void AddQuadraticBezier(const D2D1_QUADRATIC_BEZIER_SEGMENT& bezier);
```
