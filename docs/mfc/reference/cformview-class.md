# CFormView Class
The base class used for form views.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class CFormView : public CScrollView  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Protected Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CFormView::CFormView](#cformview)|Constructs a `CFormView` object.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CFormView::IsInitDlgCompleted](#isinitdlgcompleted)|Used for synchronization during initialization.|  
  
## Remarks  
 A form view is essentially a view that contains controls. These controls are laid out based on a dialog-template resource. Use `CFormView` if you want forms in your application. These views support scrolling, as needed, using the [CScrollView](../../mfc/reference/cscrollview-class.md) functionality.  
  
 When you are [Creating a Forms-Based Application](../../mfc/reference/creating-a-forms-based-mfc-application.md), you can base its view class on `CFormView`, making it a forms-based application.  
  
 You can also insert new [Form Topics](../../mfc/form-views-mfc.md) into document-view-based applications. Even if your application did not initially support forms, Visual C++ will add this support when you insert a new form.  
  
 The MFC Application Wizard and the Add Class command are the preferred methods for creating forms-based applications. If you need to create a forms-based application without using these methods, see [Creating a Forms-Based Application](../../mfc/reference/creating-a-forms-based-mfc-application.md).

 `CFormView`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxext.h  
  
##  <a name="cformview"></a>  CFormView::CFormView  
 Constructs a `CFormView` object.  
  
```  
CFormView(LPCTSTR lpszTemplateName);  
CFormView(UINT nIDTemplate);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *lpszTemplateName*  
 Contains a null-terminated string that is the name of a dialog-template resource.  
  
 *nIDTemplate*  
 Contains the ID number of a dialog-template resource.  
  
### Remarks  
 When you create an object of a type derived from `CFormView`, invoke one of the constructors to create the view object and identify the dialog resource on which the view is based. You can identify the resource either by name (pass a string as the argument to the constructor) or by its ID (pass an unsigned integer as the argument).  
  
 The form-view window and child controls are not created until `CWnd::Create` is called. `CWnd::Create` is called by the framework as part of the document and view creation process, which is driven by the document template.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Your derived class *must* supply its own constructor. In the constructor, invoke the constructor, `CFormView::CFormView`, with the resource name or ID as an argument as shown in the preceding class overview.  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#90](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cformview-class_1.h)]  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCDocView#91](../../mfc/codesnippet/cpp/cformview-class_2.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="isinitdlgcompleted"></a>  CFormView::IsInitDlgCompleted  
 Used by MFC to ensure that initialization is completed before performing other operations.  
  
```  
BOOL IsInitDlgCompleted() const;  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 True if the initialization function for this dialog has completed.
