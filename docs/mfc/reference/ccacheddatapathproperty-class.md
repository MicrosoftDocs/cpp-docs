# CCachedDataPathProperty Class
Implements an OLE control property transferred asynchronously and cached in a memory file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class CCachedDataPathProperty : public CDataPathProperty  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CCachedDataPathProperty::CCachedDataPathProperty](#ccacheddatapathproperty)|Constructs a `CCachedDataPathProperty` object.|  
  
### Public Data Members  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CCachedDataPathProperty::m_Cache](#m_cache)|`CMemFile` object in which to cache data.|  
  
## Remarks  
 A memory file is stored in RAM rather than on disk and is useful for fast temporary transfers.  
  
 Along with `CAysncMonikerFile` and `CDataPathProperty`, `CCachedDataPathProperty` provides functionality for the use of asynchronous monikers in OLE controls. With `CCachedDataPathProperty` objects, you are able to transfer data asynchronously from a URL or file source and store it in a memory file via the `m_Cache` public variable. All the data is stored in the memory file, and there is no need to override [OnDataAvailable](../../mfc/reference/casyncmonikerfile-class.md#ondataavailable) unless you want to watch for notifications and respond. For example, if you are transferring a large .GIF file and want to notify your control that more data has arrived and it should redraw itself, override `OnDataAvailable` to make the notification.  
  
 The class `CCachedDataPathProperty` is derived from `CDataPathProperty`.

## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxctl.h  
  
##  <a name="ccacheddatapathproperty"></a>  CCachedDataPathProperty::CCachedDataPathProperty  
 Constructs a `CCachedDataPathProperty` object.  
  
```  
CCachedDataPathProperty(COleControl* pControl = NULL);

 
CCachedDataPathProperty(
    LPCTSTR lpszPath,  
    COleControl* pControl = NULL);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pControl*  
 A pointer to the ActiveX control object to be associated with this `CCachedDataPathProperty` object.  
  
 *lpszPath*  
 The path, which may be absolute or relative, used to create an asynchronous moniker that references the actual absolute location of the property. `CCachedDataPathProperty` uses URLs, not filenames. If you want a `CCachedDataPathProperty` object for a file, prepend file:// to the path.  
  
### Remarks  
 The `COleControl` object pointed to by *pControl* is used by [Open](../../mfc/reference/cdatapathproperty-class.md#open) and retrieved by derived classes. If *pControl* is NULL, the control used with `Open` should be set with [SetControl](../../mfc/reference/cdatapathproperty-class.md#setcontrol). If *lpszPath* is NULL, you can pass in the path through `Open` or set it with [SetPath](../../mfc/reference/cdatapathproperty-class.md#setpath).  
  
##  <a name="m_cache"></a>  CCachedDataPathProperty::m_Cache  
 Contains the class name of the memory file into which data is cached.  
  
```  
CMemFile m_Cache;  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 A memory file is stored in RAM rather than on disk.
