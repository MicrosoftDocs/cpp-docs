# MFC ActiveX Control Wizard

An ActiveX control is a specific type of [automation server](../../mfc/automation-servers.md); it is a reusable component. The application hosting the ActiveX control is the [automation client](../../mfc/automation-clients.md) of that control. If your goal is to create such a reusable component, then use this wizard to create your control. See [MFC ActiveX Controls](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls.md) for more information.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> ActiveX is a legacy technology that should not be used for new development. For more information about modern technologies that supersede ActiveX, see [ActiveX Controls](../activex-controls.md).

Alternately, you can create an automation server MFC application using the [MFC Application Wizard](../../mfc/reference/mfc-application-wizard.md).

An ActiveX control created with this wizard can have a user interface, or it can be invisible. You can indicate this option in the [Control Settings](../../mfc/reference/control-settings-mfc-activex-control-wizard.md) page in the wizard. A timer control is an example of an ActiveX control that you would want to be invisible.

ActiveX controls can have a complex user interface. Some controls might be like encapsulated forms: a single control containing many fields, each a Windows control in its own right. For example, an auto parts object implemented as an MFC ActiveX control might present a form-like user interface through which users could read and edit the part number, part name, and other information. See [MFC ActiveX Controls](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls.md) for more information.

If you need to create a container for your ActiveX objects, see [Create an ActiveX Control Container](../../mfc/reference/creating-an-mfc-activex-control-container.md).

The MFC starter program includes C++ source (.cpp) files, resource (.rc) files, and a project (.vcxproj) file. The code generated in these starter files is based on MFC.

The following sample list shows tasks and types of enhancements for your ActiveX control:

- [Optimizing an ActiveX Control](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-optimization.md)

- [Adding Stock Events to an ActiveX Control](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-adding-stock-events-to-an-activex-control.md)

- [Adding Custom Events](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-adding-custom-events.md)

- [Adding Stock Methods](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-adding-stock-methods.md)

- [Adding Custom Methods](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-adding-custom-methods.md)

- [Adding Stock Properties](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-adding-stock-properties.md)

- [Adding Custom Properties](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-adding-custom-properties.md)

- [Programming ActiveX Controls in an ActiveX Control Container](../../mfc/programming-activex-controls-in-a-activex-control-container.md)

## Overview

This wizard page describes the current application settings for the MFC ActiveX control project you are creating. By default, the wizard creates a project as follows:

- The default project generates no run-time license or help files. You can change these default settings on the [Application Settings](../../mfc/reference/application-settings-mfc-activex-control-wizard.md) page. Only the selections you make on this page of the ActiveX Control Wizard are reflected on the **Overview** page.

- The project includes a control class and a property page class, based on the name of the project. You can edit the names of your project and file names on the [Control Names](../../mfc/reference/control-names-mfc-activex-control-wizard.md) page.

- The control is based on no existing Windows control, activates when it becomes visible, has a user interface, and includes an **About** dialog box. You can change these default settings on the [Control Settings](../../mfc/reference/control-settings-mfc-activex-control-wizard.md) page.
