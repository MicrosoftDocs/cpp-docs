# DEVNAMES Structure
The `DEVNAMES` structure contains strings that identify the driver, device, and output-port names for a printer.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct tagDEVNAMES { /* dvnm */  
    WORD wDriverOffset;  
    WORD wDeviceOffset;  
    WORD wOutputOffset;  
    WORD wDefault; */* driver,
    device,
    and port-name strings follow wDefault */  
} DEVNAMES;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *wDriverOffset*  
 (Input/Output) Specifies the offset in characters to a null-terminated string that contains the filename (without the extension) of the device driver. On input, this string is used to determine the printer to display initially in the dialog box.  
  
 *wDeviceOffset*  
 (Input/Output) Specifies the offset in characters to the null-terminated string (maximum of 32 bytes including the null) that contains the name of the device. This string must be identical to the `dmDeviceName` member of the [DEVMODE](/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-_devicemodea) structure.  
  
 *wOutputOffset*  
 (Input/Output) Specifies the offset in characters to the null-terminated string that contains the DOS device name for the physical output medium (output port).  
  
 *wDefault*  
 Specifies whether the strings contained in the `DEVNAMES` structure identify the default printer. This string is used to verify that the default printer has not changed since the last print operation. On input, if the DN_DEFAULTPRN flag is set, the other values in the `DEVNAMES` structure are checked against the current default printer. If any of the strings do not match, a warning message is displayed informing the user that the document may need to be reformatted. On output, the `wDefault` member is changed only if the Print Setup dialog box was displayed and the user chose the OK button. The DN_DEFAULTPRN flag is set if the default printer was selected. If a specific printer is selected, the flag is not set. All other bits in this member are reserved for internal use by the Print Dialog box procedure.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `PrintDlg` function uses these strings to initialize members in the system-defined Print dialog box. When the user closes the dialog box, information about the selected printer is returned in this structure.
