##  <a name="ddx_cbindex"></a>  DDX_CBIndex  
 The `DDX_CBIndex` function manages the transfer of **int** data between a combo box control in a dialog box, form view, or control view object and a **int** data member of the dialog box, form view, or control view object.  
  
```  
void AFXAPI DDX_CBIndex(
    CDataExchange* pDX,  
    int nIDC,  
    int& index);

 *rControl*  
 A reference to a member variable of the dialog box, form view, or control view object related to the specified control.  
  
### Remarks  
 The *pDX* object is supplied by the framework when the `DoDataExchange` function is called. Therefore, `DDX_Control` should only be called within your override of `DoDataExchange`.  
  
 For more information about DDX, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md).  
  
### Requirements  
  **Header** afxdd_.h  
  
##  <a name="ddx_datetimectrl"></a>  DDX_DateTimeCtrl  
 The `DDX_DateTimeCtrl` function manages the transfer of date and/or time data between a date and time picker control ( [CDateTimeCtrl](../../mfc/reference/cdatetimectrl-class.md)) in a dialog box or form view object and either a [CTime](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/ctime-class.md) or a [COleDateTime](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetime-class.md) data member of the dialog box or form view object.  
  
```  
void AFXAPI DDX_DateTimeCtrl(

    int nIDC,  
    CTime& value);

void AFXAPI DDX_DateTimeCtrl(
    CDataExchange* pDX,  
    int nIDC,  
    COleDateTime& value);

void AFXAPI DDX_DateTimeCtrl(
    CDataExchange* pDX,  
    int nIDC,  
    CString& value);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pDX*  
 A pointer to a [CDataExchange](../../mfc/reference/cdataexchange-class.md) object. The framework supplies this object to establish the context of the data exchange, including its direction. You don't need to delete this object.  
  
 *nIDC*  
 The resource ID of the date and time picker control associated with the member variable.  
  
 *value*  
 In the first two versions, a reference to a `CTime` or `COleDateTime` member variable, dialog box, form view, or control view object with which data is exchanged. In the third version, a reference to a `CString` data member control view object.  
  
### Remarks  
 When `DDX_DateTimeCtrl` is called, *value* is set to the current state of the date and time picker control, or the control is set to *value*, depending on the direction of the exchange.  
  
 In the third version above, `DDX_DateTimeCtrl` manages the transfer of `CString` data between a date time control and a [CString](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md) data member of the control view object. The string is formatted using the current locale's rules for formatting dates and times.  
  
 For more information about DDX, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md).  
  
### Requirements  
  **Header** afxdd_.h  

## <a name="ddx_managedcontrol"></a>  DDX_ManagedControl
Creates a .NET control matching the control's resource ID.  
   
### Syntax  
```  
template <typename T>  
void DDX_ManagedControl(  
     CDataExchange* pDX,   
     int nIDC,   
     CWinFormsControl<T>& control );  
```
### Parameters  
 *pDX*  
 A pointer to a [CDataExchange Class](cdataexchange-class.md) object. The framework supplies this object to establish the context of the data exchange, including its direction.  
  
 *nIDC*  
 The resource ID of the control associated with the control property.  
  
 *control*  
 A reference to a [CWinFormsControl Class](cwinformscontrol-class.md) object.  
   
### Remarks  
 `DDX_ManagedControl` calls [CWinFormsControl::CreateManagedControl](cwinformscontrol-class.md#createmanagedcontrol) to create a control matching the resource control ID. Use `DDX_ManagedControl` to create controls from resource IDs in [CDialog::OnInitDialog](cdialog-class.md#oninitdialog). For data exchange, you do not need to use the DDX/DDV functions with Windows Forms controls.  
  
 For more information, see [How to: Do DDX/DDV Data Binding with Windows Forms](../../dotnet/how-to-do-ddx-ddv-data-binding-with-windows-forms.md).  
   
### Requirements  
 **Header:** afxwinforms.h  
   
### See Also  
 [CWinFormsControl::CreateManagedControl](cwinformscontrol-class.md#createmanagedcontrol)   
 [CDialog::OnInitDialog](cdialog-class.md#oninitdialog)
 

  
##  <a name="ddx_ipaddress"></a>  DDX_IPAddress  
 The `DDX_IPAddress` function manages the transfer of data between an IP Address control and a data member of the control view object.  
  
```  
void AFXAPI DDX_IPAddress(
    CDataExchange* pDX,  
    int nIDC,  
    DWORD& value);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *pDX*  
 A pointer to a `CDataExchange` object. The framework supplies this object to establish the context of the data exchange, including its direction.  
  
 *nIDC*  
 The resource ID of the IP Address control associated with the control property.  
  
 *value*  
 A reference to the DWORD containing the four-field value of the IP Address control. The fields are filled or read as follows.  
  
|Field|Bits containing the field value|  
|-----------|-------------------------------------|  
|3|0 through 7|  
|2|8 through 15|  
|1|16 through 23|  
|0|24 through 31|  
  
 Use the Win32 [IPM_GETADDRESS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761378) to read the value, or use [IPM_SETADDRESS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761380) to fill the value. These messages are described in the Windows SDK.  
  
### Remarks  
 When `DDX_IPAddress` is called, *value* is either read from the IP Address control, or *value* is written to the control, depending on the direction of the exchange.  
  
 For more information about DDX, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md).  
  
### Requirements  
  **Header** afxdd_.h  
  
##  <a name="ddx_lbindex"></a>  DDX_LBIndex  
 The `DDX_LBIndex` function manages the transfer of **int** data between a list box control in a dialog box, form view, or control view object and an **int** data member of the dialog box, form view, or control view object.

    CDataExchange* pDX,  
    int nIDC,  
    int& index);  
```  
  
### Parameters

 A reference to a member variable of the dialog box, form view, or control view object with which data is exchanged.  
  
### Remarks  
 When `DDX_LBIndex` is called, *index* is set to the index of the current list box selection. If no item is selected, *index* is set to -1.  
  
 For more information about DDX, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md).  
  
### Requirements

 *value*  
 A reference to a member variable of the dialog box, form view, or control view object with which data is exchanged.  
  
### Remarks  
 When `DDX_LBString` is called to transfer data to a list box control, the first item in the control whose beginning matches *value* is selected. (To match the entire item rather than just a prefix, use [DDX_LBStringExact](#ddx_lbstringexact).) If there are no matches, no items are selected. The matching is case-insensitive.

### Remarks  
 When `DDX_LBStringExact` is called to transfer data to a list box control, the first item in the control that matches *value* is selected. (To match just a prefix rather than the entire item, use [DDX_LBString](#ddx_lbstring).) If there are no matches, no items are selected. The matching is case-insensitive.  
  
 When `DDX_CBStringExact` is called to transfer data from a list box control, *value* is set to the current list box selection. If no item is selected, *value* is set to a string of zero length.

 *value*  
 A reference to a data member in the dialog box, form view, or control view object. The data type of *value* depends on which of the overloaded versions of `DDX_Text` you use.
