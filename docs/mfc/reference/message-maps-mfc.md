# Message Maps (MFC)
This section of the reference lists all [message mapping macros](../../mfc/reference/message-map-macros-mfc.md) and all [CWnd](../../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md) message-map entries along with the corresponding member function prototypes:  
  
|Category|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|ON\_COMMAND Message Handler|Handles `WM_COMMAND` messages generated by user menu selections or menu access keys.|  
|[Child Window Notification Message Handlers](../../mfc/reference/child-window-notification-message-handlers.md)|Handle notification messages from child windows.|  
|[WM_ Message Handlers](../../mfc/reference/handlers-for-wm-messages.md)|Handle `WM_` messages, such as `WM_PAINT`.|  
|[User-Defined Message Handlers](../../mfc/reference/user-defined-handlers.md)|Handle user-defined messages.|  
  
 (For an explanation of the terminology and conventions used in this reference, see [How to Use the Message Map Cross-Reference](../../mfc/reference/how-to-use-the-message-map-cross-reference.md).)  
  
 Since Windows is a message-oriented operating system, a large portion of programming for the Windows environment involves message handling. Each time an event such as a keystroke or mouse click occurs, a message is sent to the application, which must then handle the event.  
  
 The Microsoft Foundation Class Library offers a programming model optimized for message-based programming. In this model, "message maps" are used to designate which functions will handle various messages for a particular class. Message maps contain one or more macros that specify which messages will be handled by which functions. For example, a message map containing an `ON_COMMAND` macro might look something like this:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCMessageMaps#16](../../mfc/reference/codesnippet/cpp/message-maps-mfc_1.cpp)]  
  
 The `ON_COMMAND` macro is used to handle command messages generated by menus, buttons, and accelerator keys. [Macros](../../mfc/reference/message-map-macros-mfc.md) are available to map the following:  
  
## Windows Messages  
  
-   Control notifications  
  
-   User-defined messages  
  
## Command Messages  
  
-   Registered user-defined messages  
  
-   User-interface update messages  
  
## Ranges of Messages  
  
-   Commands  
  
-   Update handler messages  
  
-   Control notifications  
  
 Although message-map macros are important, you generally won't have to use them directly. This is because the Properties window automatically creates message-map entries in your source files when you use it to associate message-handling functions with messages. Any time you want to edit or add a message-map entry, you can use the Properties window.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Properties window does not support message-map ranges. You must write these message-map entries yourself.  
  
 However, message maps are an important part of the Microsoft Foundation Class Library. You should understand what they do, and documentation is provided for them.
