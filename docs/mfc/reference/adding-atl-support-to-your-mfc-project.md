# Adding ATL Support to Your MFC Project
If you have already created an MFC-based application, then you can add support for the Active Template Library (ATL) easily by running the Add ATL Support to MFC Project Wizard.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  ATL and MFC are not generally supported in the Express editions of Visual Studio.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This support applies only to simple COM objects added to an MFC executable or DLL project. You can add other COM objects (including ActiveX controls) to MFC projects, but the objects might not operate as expected.  
  
### To add ATL support to your MFC project  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the project to which you want to add ATL support.  
  
2.  On the shortcut menu, click **Add**, and then click **Add Class**.  
  
3.  Select the **Add ATL Support to MFC Project** icon.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  This icon is located in the ATL folder in the **Categories** pane.  
  
4.  When prompted, click **Yes** to add ATL support.  
  
 For more information about how adding ATL support changes your MFC project's code, see [Details of ATL Support Added by the ATL Wizard](../../mfc/reference/details-of-atl-support-added-by-the-atl-wizard.md)
