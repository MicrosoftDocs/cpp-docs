# COLORADJUSTMENT Structure
The `COLORADJUSTMENT` structure defines the color adjustment values used by the Windows `StretchBlt` and `StretchDIBits` functions when the `StretchBlt` mode is HALFTONE.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef struct  tagCOLORADJUSTMENT {    /* ca */  
    WORD caSize;  
    WORD caFlags;  
    WORD caIlluminantIndex;  
    WORD caRedGamma;  
    WORD caGreenGamma;  
    WORD caBlueGamma;  
    WORD caReferenceBlack;  
    WORD caReferenceWhite;  
    SHORT caContrast;  
    SHORT caBrightness;  
    SHORT caColorfulness;  
    SHORT caRedGreenTint;  
} COLORADJUSTMENT;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *caSize*  
 Specifies the size of the structure in bytes.  
  
 *caFlags*  
 Specifies how the output image should be prepared. This member can be set to NULL or any combination of the following values:  
  
- CA_NEGATIVE Specifies that the negative of the original image should be displayed.  
  
- CA_LOG_FILTER Specifies that a logarithmic function should be applied to the final density of the output colors. This will increase the color contrast when the luminance is low.  
  
 *caIlluminantIndex*  
 Specifies the luminance of the light source under which the image object is viewed. This member can be set to one of the following values:  
  
- ILLUMINANT_EQUAL_ENERGY  
  
- ILLUMINANT_A  
  
- ILLUMINANT_B  
  
- ILLUMINANT_C  
  
- ILLUMINANT_D50  
  
- ILLUMINANT_D55  
  
- ILLUMINANT_D65  
  
- ILLUMINANT_D75  
  
- ILLUMINANT_F2  
  
- ILLUMINANT_TURNGSTEN  
  
- ILLUMINANT_DAYLIGHT  
  
- ILLUMINANT_FLUORESCENT  
  
- ILLUMINANT_NTSC  
  
 *caRedGamma*  
 Specifies the nth power gamma-correction value for the red primary of the source colors. The value must be in the range from 2,500 to 65,000. A value of 10,000 means no gamma-correction.  
  
 *caGreenGamma*  
 Specifies the nth power gamma-correction value for the green primary of the source colors. The value must be in the range from 2,500 to 65,000. A value of 10,000 means no gamma-correction.  
  
 *caBlueGamma*  
 Specifies the nth power gamma-correction value for the blue primary of the source colors. The value must be in the range from 2,500 to 65,000. A value of 10,000 means no gamma-correction.  
  
 *caReferenceBlack*  
 Specifies the black reference for the source colors. Any colors that are darker than this are treated as black. The value must be in the range from 0 to 4,000.  
  
 *caReferenceWhite*  
 Specifies the white reference for the source colors. Any colors that are lighter than this are treated as white. The value must be in the range from 6,000 to 10,000.  
  
 *caContrast*  
 Specifies the amount of contrast to be applied to the source object. The value must be in the range from -100 to 100. A value of 0 means no contrast adjustment.  
  
 *caBrightness*  
 Specifies the amount of brightness to be applied to the source object. The value must be in the range from -100 to 100. A value of 0 means no brightness adjustment.  
  
 *caColorfulness*  
 Specifies the amount of colorfulness to be applied to the source object. The value must be in the range from -100 to 100. A value of 0 means no colorfulness adjustment.  
  
 *caRedGreenTint*  
 Specifies the amount of red or green tint adjustment to be applied to the source object. The value must be in the range from -100 to 100. Positive numbers would adjust towards red and negative numbers adjust towards green. A 0 means no tint adjustment.
