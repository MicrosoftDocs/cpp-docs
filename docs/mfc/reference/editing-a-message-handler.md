# Editing a Message Handler
Once you have defined a message handler, you can go to the member function's definition to add or modify code.  
  
 To jump to a member function definition from the [dialog editor](../../windows/dialog-editor.md), double-click a control for which a handler is already defined. This navigates you to the file in which the selected control's message handler is defined.  
  
 To jump to a member function definition from [Class View](/visualstudio/ide/viewing-the-structure-of-code), double-click the function name in Class View.
