# Notifications Sent by Animation Controls
An animation control ([CAnimateCtrl](../mfc/reference/canimatectrl-class.md)) sends two different types of notification messages. The notifications are sent in the form of [WM_COMMAND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms647591) messages.  
  
 The [ACN_START](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761891) message is sent when the animation control has started playing a clip. The [ACN_STOP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb761893) message is sent when the animation control has finished or stopped playing a clip.
