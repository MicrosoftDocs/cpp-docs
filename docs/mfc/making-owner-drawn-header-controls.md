# Making Owner-Drawn Header Controls
You can define individual items of a header control ([CHeaderCtrl](../mfc/reference/cheaderctrl-class.md)) to be owner-drawn items. For more information, see [Owner-Drawn Header Controls](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb775238) in the Windows SDK.
