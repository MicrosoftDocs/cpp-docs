# Disabling Guides
You can use special keys in conjunction with the mouse to disable the snapping effect of the guides. Using the ALT key disables the snapping effects of the guide selected. Moving a guide with the SHIFT key prevents snapped controls from moving with the guide.  
  
### To disable the snapping effect of the guides  
  
1.  Drag the control while holding down the **ALT** key.  
  
### To move guides without moving the snapped controls  
  
1.  Drag the guide while holding down the **SHIFT** key.  
  
### To turn off the guides  
  
1.  From the **Format** menu, choose **Guide Settings**.  
  
2.  In the [Guide Settings Dialog Box](../mfc/guide-settings-dialog-box.md), under **Layout Guides**, select **None**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can also double-click the ruler bar to access the **Guide Settings** dialog box.  
  
 \- or -  
  
-   On the **Format** menu, click **Toggle Guides**.
