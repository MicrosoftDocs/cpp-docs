# Elapsed Time: General-Purpose Classes

The following procedure shows how to calculate the difference between two `CTime` objects and get a `CTimeSpan` result. Use the `CTime` and `CTimeSpan` objects to calculate the elapsed time, as follows:

   [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#174](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/elapsed-time-general-purpose-classes_1.cpp)]

Once you have calculated `elapsedTime`, you can use the member functions of `CTimeSpan` to extract the components of the elapsed-time value.
