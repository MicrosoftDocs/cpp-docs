# Formatting Time Values: General-Purpose Classes
The following procedure shows how to format time values.  
  
#### To format a string representation of a time or elapsed time  
  
1.  Use the **Format** member function from either the [CTime](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/ctime-class.md) or [CTimeSpan](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/ctimespan-class.md) classes to create a character string representation of the time or elapsed time, as shown by the following example.  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#175](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/formatting-time-values-general-purpose-classes_1.cpp)]
