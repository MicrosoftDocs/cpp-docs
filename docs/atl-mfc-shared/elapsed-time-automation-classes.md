# Elapsed Time: Automation Classes

This procedure shows how to calculate the difference between two `CTime` objects and get a `CTimeSpan` result.

## To calculate elapsed time

1. Create two `COleDateTime` objects.

1. Set one of the `COleDateTime` objects to the current time.

1. Perform some time-consuming task.

1. Set the other `COleDateTime` object to the current time.

1. Take the difference between the two times.
