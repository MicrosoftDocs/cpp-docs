# Formatting Time: Automation Classes
#### To format a time  
  
1.  Use the **Format** member function of either [COleDateTime](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetime-class.md) or [COleDateTimeSpan](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetimespan-class.md) to create a character string representing the time or elapsed time.  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#179](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/formatting-time-automation-classes_1.cpp)]  
  
 For more information, see class [COleVariant](../mfc/reference/colevariant-class.md).
