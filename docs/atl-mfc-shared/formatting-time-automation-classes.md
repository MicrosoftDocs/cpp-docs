# Formatting Time: Automation Classes

## To format a time

Use the `Format` member function of either [COleDateTime](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetime-class.md) or [COleDateTimeSpan](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetimespan-class.md) to create a character string representing the time or elapsed time.

   [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#179](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/formatting-time-automation-classes_1.cpp)]

For more information, see class [COleVariant](../mfc/reference/colevariant-class.md).
