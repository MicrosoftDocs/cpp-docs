# CString Semantics

Even though [CString](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md) objects are dynamic objects that can grow, they act like built-in primitive types and simple classes. Each `CString` object represents a unique value. `CString` objects should be thought of as the actual strings rather than as pointers to strings.

You can assign one `CString` object to another. However, when you modify one of the two `CString` objects, the other `CString` object is not modified, as shown by the following example:

[!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#188](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cstring-semantics_1.cpp)]

Note in the example that the two `CString` objects are considered "equal" because they represent the same character string. The `CString` class overloads the equality operator (`==`) to compare two `CString` objects based on their value (contents) rather than their identity (address).
