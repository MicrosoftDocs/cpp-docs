# Date and Time: Database Support

As of version 4.0, MFC database programming uses the [COleDateTime](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetime-class.md) and [COleDateTimeSpan](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetimespan-class.md) classes to represent date and time data. These classes, also used in Automation, are derived from class [COleVariant](../mfc/reference/colevariant-class.md). They supply better support for managing date and time data than do [CTime](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/ctime-class.md) and [CTimeSpan](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/ctimespan-class.md).
