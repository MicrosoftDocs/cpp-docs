# CPoint Class
Similar to the Windows `POINT` structure.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class CPoint : public tagPOINT 
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CPoint::CPoint](#cpoint)|Constructs a `CPoint`.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CPoint::Offset](#offset)|Adds values to the `x` and `y` members of the `CPoint`.|  
  
### Public Operators  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[CPoint::operator -](#operator_-)|Returns the difference of a `CPoint` and a size, or the negation of a point, or the size difference between two points, or the offset by a negative size.|  
|[CPoint::operator !=](#operator_neq)|Checks for inequality between two points.|  
|[CPoint::operator +](#operator_add)|Returns the sum of a `CPoint` and a size or point, or a `CRect` offset by a size.|  
|[CPoint::operator +=](#operator_add_eq)|Offsets `CPoint` by adding a size or point.|  
|[CPoint::operator -=](#operator_-_eq)|Offsets `CPoint` by subtracting a size or point.|  
|[CPoint::operator ==](#operator_eq_eq)|Checks for equality between two points.|  
  
## Remarks  
 It also includes member functions to manipulate `CPoint` and [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structures.  
  
 A `CPoint` object can be used wherever a `POINT` structure is used. The operators of this class that interact with a "size" accept either [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) objects or [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structures, since the two are interchangeable.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This class is derived from the `tagPOINT` structure. (The name `tagPOINT` is a less commonly used name for the `POINT` structure.) This means that the data members of the `POINT` structure, `x` and `y`, are accessible data members of `CPoint`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For more information on shared utility classes (like `CPoint`), see [Shared Classes](../../atl-mfc-shared/atl-mfc-shared-classes.md).  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy

 `CPoint`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** atltypes.h  
  
##  <a name="cpoint"></a>  CPoint::CPoint
 Constructs a `CPoint` object.

CPoint() throw();
CPoint(int initX, int initY) throw();
CPoint(POINT initPt) throw();
CPoint(SIZE initSize) throw();
CPoint(LPARAM dwPoint) throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *initX*  
 Specifies the value of the `x` member of `CPoint`.  
  
 *initY*  
 Specifies the value of the `y` member of `CPoint`.  
  
 *initPt*  
 [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or `CPoint` that specifies the values used to initialize `CPoint`.  
  
 *initSize*  
 [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) that specifies the values used to initialize `CPoint`.  
  
 *dwPoint*  
 Sets the `x` member to the low-order word of *dwPoint* and the `y` member to the high-order word of *dwPoint*.  
  
### Remarks  
 If no arguments are given, `x` and `y` members are set to 0.  
  
### Example  
  
```cpp   
CPoint   ptTopLeft(0, 0); 
// works from a POINT, too  
 
POINT   ptHere;  
ptHere.x = 35;  
ptHere.y = 95;  
 
CPoint   ptMFCHere(ptHere);
 
// works from a SIZE 
SIZE   sHowBig;  
sHowBig.cx = 300;  
sHowBig.cy = 10;  
 
CPoint ptMFCBig(sHowBig); 
// or from a DWORD  
 
DWORD   dwSize;  
dwSize = MAKELONG(35, 95);
 
CPoint ptFromDouble(dwSize);
ASSERT(ptFromDouble == ptMFCHere);
```  
  
##  <a name="offset"></a>  CPoint::Offset  
 Adds values to the `x` and `y` members of the `CPoint`.  
  
```  
void Offset(int xOffset, int yOffset) throw();
void Offset(POINT point) throw();
void Offset(SIZE size) throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *xOffset*  
 Specifies the amount to offset the `x` member of the `CPoint`.  
  
 *yOffset*  
 Specifies the amount to offset the `y` member of the `CPoint`.  
  
 *point*

 *size*  
 Specifies the amount ( [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md)) to offset the `CPoint`.  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#28](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_1.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="operator_eq_eq"></a>  CPoint::operator ==  
 Checks for equality between two points.  
  
```  
BOOL operator==(POINT point) const throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *point*  
 Contains a [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or `CPoint` object.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if the points are equal; otherwise 0.  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#29](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_2.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="operator_neq"></a>  CPoint::operator !=  
 Checks for inequality between two points.  
  
```  
BOOL operator!=(POINT point) const throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *point*  
 Contains a [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or `CPoint` object.  
  
### Return Value  
 Nonzero if the points are not equal; otherwise 0.  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#30](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_3.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="operator_add_eq"></a>  CPoint::operator +=  
 The first overload adds a size to the `CPoint`.  
  
```  
void operator+=(SIZE size) throw(); 
void operator+=(POINT point) throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *size*  
 Contains a [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) object.  
  
 *point*  
 Contains a [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object.  
  
### Remarks  
 The second overload adds a point to the `CPoint`.  
  
 In both cases, addition is done by adding the `x` (or `cx`) member of the right-hand operand to the `x` member of the `CPoint` and adding the `y` (or `cy`) member of the right-hand operand to the `y` member of the `CPoint`.  
  
 For example, adding `CPoint(5, -7)` to a variable which contains `CPoint(30, 40)` changes the variable to `CPoint(35, 33)`.  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#31](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_4.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="operator_-_eq"></a>  CPoint::operator -=  
 The first overload subtracts a size from the `CPoint`.  
  
```  
void operator-=(SIZE size) throw(); 
void operator-=(POINT point) throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *size*  
 Contains a [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) object.  
  
 *point*  
 Contains a [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object.  
  
### Remarks  
 The second overload subtracts a point from the `CPoint`.  
  
 In both cases, subtraction is done by subtracting the `x` (or `cx`) member of the right-hand operand from the `x` member of the `CPoint` and subtracting the `y` (or `cy`) member of the right-hand operand from the `y` member of the `CPoint`.  
  
 For example, subtracting `CPoint(5, -7)` from a variable which contains `CPoint(30, 40)` changes the variable to `CPoint(25, 47)`.  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#32](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_5.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="operator_add"></a>  CPoint::operator +  
 Use this operator to offset `CPoint` by a `CPoint` or `CSize` object, or to offset a `CRect` by a `CPoint`.  
  
```  
CPoint operator+(SIZE size) const throw();
CPoint operator+(POINT point) const throw();
CRect operator+(const RECT* lpRect) const throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *size*  
 Contains a [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) object.  
  
 *point*  
 Contains a [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object.  
  
 *lpRect*  
 Contains a pointer to a [RECT](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) structure or [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object.  
  
### Return Value  
 A `CPoint` that is offset by a size, a `CPoint` that is offset by a point, or a `CRect` offset by a point.  
  
### Remarks  
 For example, using one of the first two overloads to offset the point `CPoint(25, -19)` by a point `CPoint(15, 5)` or size `CSize(15, 5)` returns the value `CPoint(40, -14)`.  
  
 Adding a rectangle to a point returns the rectangle after being offset by the `x` and `y` values specified in the point. For example, using the last overload to offset a rectangle `CRect(125, 219, 325, 419)` by a point `CPoint(25, -19)` returns `CRect(150, 200, 350, 400)`.  
  
### Example  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#33](../../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/cpoint-class_6.cpp)]  
  
##  <a name="operator_-"></a>  CPoint::operator -  
 Use one of the first two overloads to subtract a `CPoint` or `CSize` object from `CPoint`.  
  
```  
CSize operator-(POINT point) const throw();
CPoint operator-(SIZE size) const throw();
CRect operator-(const RECT* lpRect) const throw();
CPoint operator-() const throw();
```  
  
### Parameters  
 *point*  
 A [POINT](../../mfc/reference/point-structure1.md) structure or [CPoint](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cpoint-class.md) object.  
  
 *size*  
 A [SIZE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd145106) structure or [CSize](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/csize-class.md) object.  
  
 *lpRect*  
 A pointer to a [RECT](../../mfc/reference/rect-structure1.md) structure or a [CRect](../../atl-mfc-shared/reference/crect-class.md) object.  
  
### Return Value  
 A `CSize` that is the difference between two points, a `CPoint` that is offset by the negation of a size, a `CRect` that is offset by the negation of a point, or a `CPoint` that is the negation of a point.  
  
### Remarks  
 The third overload offsets a `CRect` by the negation of `CPoint`. Finally, use the unary operator to negate `CPoint`.  
  
 For example, using the first overload to find the difference between two points `CPoint(25, -19)` and `CPoint(15, 5)` returns `CSize(10, -24)`.  
  
 Subtracting a `CSize` from `CPoint` does the same calculation as above but returns a `CPoint` object, not a `CSize` object. For example, using the second overload to find the difference between the point `CPoint(25, -19)` and the size `CSize(15, 5)` returns `CPoint(10, -24)`.  
  
 Subtracting a rectangle from a point returns the rectangle offset by the negatives of the `x` and `y` values specified in the point. For example, using the last overload to offset the rectangle `CRect(125, 200, 325, 400)` by the point `CPoint(25, -19)` returns `CRect(100, 219, 300, 419)`.  
  
 Use the unary operator to negate a point. For example, using the unary operator with the point `CPoint(25, -19)` returns `CPoint(-25, 19)`.
