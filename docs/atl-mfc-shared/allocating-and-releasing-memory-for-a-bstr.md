# Allocating and Releasing Memory for a BSTR
When you create `BSTR`s and pass them between COM objects, you must take care in treating the memory they use in order to avoid memory leaks. When a `BSTR` stays within an interface, you must free its memory when you are done with it. However, when a `BSTR` passes out of an interface, the receiving object takes responsibility for its memory management.  
  
 In general, the rules for allocating and releasing memory allocated for `BSTR`s are as follows:  
  
-   When you call into a function that expects a `BSTR` argument, you must allocate the memory for the `BSTR` before the call and release it afterwards. For example:  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#192](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/allocating-and-releasing-memory-for-a-bstr_1.cpp)]  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#193](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/allocating-and-releasing-memory-for-a-bstr_2.cpp)]  
  
-   When you call into a function that returns a `BSTR`, you must free the string yourself. For example:  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#194](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/allocating-and-releasing-memory-for-a-bstr_3.cpp)]  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#195](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/allocating-and-releasing-memory-for-a-bstr_4.cpp)]  
  
-   When you implement a function that returns a `BSTR`, allocate the string but do not free it. The receiving the function releases the memory. For example:  
  
     [!code-cpp[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#196](../atl-mfc-shared/codesnippet/cpp/allocating-and-releasing-memory-for-a-bstr_5.cpp)]
