# Using CString
The topics in this section describe how to program with `CString`. For reference documentation about the `CString` class, see the documentation for [CStringT](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md).  
  
 To use `CString`, include the `atlstr.h` header.  
  
 The `CString`, `CStringA`, and `CStringW` classes are specializations of a class template called [CStringT](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/cstringt-class.md) based on the type of character data they support.  
  
 A `CStringW` object contains the `wchar_t` type and supports Unicode strings. A `CStringA` object contains the **char** type, and supports single-byte and multi-byte (MBCS) strings. A `CString` object supports either the **char** type or the `wchar_t` type, depending on whether the MBCS symbol or the UNICODE symbol is defined at compile time.  
  
 A `CString` object keeps character data in a `CStringData` object. `CString` accepts `null`-terminated C-style strings. `CString` tracks the string length for faster performance, but it also retains the **null** character in the stored character data to support conversion to LPCWSTR. `CString` includes the null terminator when it exports a C-style string. You can insert a **null** at other locations in a `CString`, but it may produce unexpected results.  
  
 The following set of string classes can be used without linking an MFC library, with or without CRT support: `CAtlString`, `CAtlStringA`, and `CAtlStringW`.  
  
 `CString` is used in native projects. For managed-code (C++/CLI) projects, use `System::String`.  
  
 To add more capabilities than `CString`, `CStringA`, or `CStringW` currently offer, you should create a subclass of `CStringT` that contains the additional features.  
  
 The following code shows how to create a `CString` and print it to standard output:  
  
```cpp  
#include <atlstr.h>  
  
int main() {  
    CString aCString = CString(_T("A string"));  
    _tprintf(_T("%s"), (LPCTSTR) aCString);  
}  
```  
  
## In This Section  
 [Basic CString Operations](../atl-mfc-shared/basic-cstring-operations.md)  
 Describes basic `CString` operations, including creating objects from C literal strings, accessing individual characters in a `CString`, concatenating two objects, and comparing `CString` objects.  
  
 [String Data Management](../atl-mfc-shared/string-data-management.md)  
 Discusses using Unicode and MBCS with `CString`.  
  
 [CString Semantics](../atl-mfc-shared/cstring-semantics.md)  
 Explains how `CString` objects are used.  
  
 [CString Operations Relating to C-Style Strings](../atl-mfc-shared/cstring-operations-relating-to-c-style-strings.md)  
 Describes manipulating the contents of a `CString` object like a C-style null-terminated string.  
  
 [Allocating and Releasing Memory for a BSTR](../atl-mfc-shared/allocating-and-releasing-memory-for-a-bstr.md)  
 Discusses using memory for a BSTR and COM objects.  
  
 [CString Exception Cleanup](../atl-mfc-shared/cstring-exception-cleanup.md)  
 Explains that explicit cleanup in MFC 3.0 and later is no longer necessary.  
  
 [CString Argument Passing](../atl-mfc-shared/cstring-argument-passing.md)  
 Explains how to pass CString objects to functions and how to return `CString` objects from functions.  
  
 [Unicode and Multibyte Character Set (MBCS) Support](../atl-mfc-shared/unicode-and-multibyte-character-set-mbcs-support.md)  
 Discusses how MFC is enabled for Unicode and MBCS support.
