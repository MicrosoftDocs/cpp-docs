# 3.2.3 omp_set_lock and omp_set_nest_lock Functions
Each of these functions blocks the thread executing the function until the specified lock is available and then sets the lock. A simple lock is available if it is unlocked. A nestable lock is available if it is unlocked or if it is already owned by the thread executing the function. The format is as follows:  
  
```  
#include <omp.h>  
void omp_set_lock(omp_lock_t *lock);  
void omp_set_nest_lock(omp_nest_lock_t *lock);  
```  
  
 For a simple lock, the argument to the `omp_set_lock` function must point to an initialized lock variable. Ownership of the lock is granted to the thread executing the function.  
  
 For a nestable lock, the argument to the `omp_set_nest_lock` function must point to an initialized lock variable. The nesting count is incremented, and the thread is granted, or retains, ownership of the lock.
