# 2.4.2 sections Construct
The **sections** directive identifies a noniterative work-sharing construct that specifies a set of constructs that are to be divided among threads in a team. Each section is executed once by a thread in the team. The syntax of the **sections** directive is as follows:  
  
```  
#pragma omp sections [clause[[,] clause] ...] new-line  
   {  
   [#pragma omp section new-line]  
      structured-block  
   [#pragma omp section new-linestructured-block ]  
...  
}  
```  
  
 The clause is one of the following:  
  
 **private(** *variable-list* **)**  
  
 **firstprivate(** *variable-list* **)**  
  
 **lastprivate(** *variable-list* **)**  
  
 **reduction(** *operator* **:**  *variable-list* **)**  
  
 **nowait**  
  
 Each section is preceded by a **section** directive, although the **section** directive is optional for the first section. The **section** directives must appear within the lexical extent of the **sections** directive. There is an implicit barrier at the end of a **sections** construct, unless a **nowait** is specified.  
  
 Restrictions to the **sections** directive are as follows:  
  
-   A **section** directive must not appear outside the lexical extent of the **sections** directive.  
  
-   Only a single **nowait** clause can appear on a **sections** directive.
