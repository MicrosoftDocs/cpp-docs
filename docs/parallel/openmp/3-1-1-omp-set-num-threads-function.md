# 3.1.1 omp_set_num_threads Function
The `omp_set_num_threads` function sets the default number of threads to use for subsequent parallel regions that do not specify a `num_threads` clause. The format is as follows:  
  
```  
#include <omp.h>  
void omp_set_num_threads(int num_threads);  
```  
  
 The value of the parameter *num_threads* must be a positive integer. Its effect depends upon whether dynamic adjustment of the number of threads is enabled. For a comprehensive set of rules about the interaction between the `omp_set_num_threads` function and dynamic adjustment of threads, see Section 2.3 on page 8.  
  
 This function has the effects described above when called from a portion of the program where the `omp_in_parallel` function returns zero. If it is called from a portion of the program where the `omp_in_parallel` function returns a nonzero value, the behavior of this function is undefined.  
  
 This call has precedence over the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. The default value for the number of threads, which may be established by calling `omp_set_num_threads` or by setting the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable, can be explicitly overridden on a single **parallel** directive by specifying the `num_threads` clause.
