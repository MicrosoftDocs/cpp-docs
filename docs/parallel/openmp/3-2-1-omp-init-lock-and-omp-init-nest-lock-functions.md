# 3.2.1 omp_init_lock and omp_init_nest_lock Functions
These functions provide the only means of initializing a lock. Each function initializes the lock associated with the parameter *lock* for use in subsequent calls. The format is as follows:  
  
```  
#include <omp.h>  
void omp_init_lock(omp_lock_t *lock);  
void omp_init_nest_lock(omp_nest_lock_t *lock);  
```  
  
 The initial state is unlocked (that is, no thread owns the lock). For a nestable lock, the initial nesting count is zero. It is noncompliant to call either of these routines with a lock variable that has already been initialized.
