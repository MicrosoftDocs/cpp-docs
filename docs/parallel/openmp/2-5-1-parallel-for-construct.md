# 2.5.1 parallel for Construct
The **parallel for** directive is a shortcut for a **parallel** region that contains only a single **for** directive. The syntax of the **parallel for** directive is as follows:  
  
```  
#pragma omp parallel for [clause[[,] clause] ...] new-linefor-loop  
```  
  
 This directive allows all the clauses of the **parallel** directive and the **for** directive, except the `nowait` clause, with identical meanings and restrictions. The semantics are identical to explicitly specifying a **parallel** directive immediately followed by a **for** directive.
