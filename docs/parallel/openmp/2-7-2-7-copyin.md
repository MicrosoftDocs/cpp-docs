# 2.7.2.7 copyin
The **copyin** clause provides a mechanism to assign the same value to **threadprivate** variables for each thread in the team executing the parallel region. For each variable specified in a **copyin** clause, the value of the variable in the master thread of the team is copied, as if by assignment, to the thread-private copies at the beginning of the parallel region. The syntax of the **copyin** clause is as follows:  
  
```  
  
copyin(  
variable-list  
)  
  
```  
  
 The restrictions to the **copyin** clause are as follows:  
  
-   A variable that is specified in the **copyin** clause must have an accessible, unambiguous copy assignment operator.  
  
-   A variable that is specified in the **copyin** clause must be a **threadprivate** variable.
