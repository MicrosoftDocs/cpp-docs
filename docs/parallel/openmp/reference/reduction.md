# reduction
Specifies that one or more variables that are private to each thread are the subject of a reduction operation at the end of the parallel region.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
reduction(operation:var)  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 where,  
  
 `operation`  
 The operator for the operation to perform on the variables (`var`) at the end of the parallel region.  
  
 `var`  
 One or more variables on which to perform scalar reduction. If more than one variable is specified, separate variable names with a comma.  
  
## Remarks  
 `reduction` applies to the following directives:  
  
-   [for](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/for-openmp.md)  
  
-   [parallel](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/parallel.md)  
  
-   [sections](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/sections-openmp.md)  
  
 For more information, see [2.7.2.6 reduction](../../../parallel/openmp/2-7-2-6-reduction.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// omp_reduction.cpp
