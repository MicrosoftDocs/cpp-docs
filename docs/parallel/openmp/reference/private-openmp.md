# private (OpenMP)
Specifies that each thread should have its own instance of a variable.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
private(var)  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 where,  
  
 `var`  
 The variable to have instances in each thread.  
  
## Remarks  
 **private** applies to the following directives:  
  
-   [for](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/for-openmp.md)  
  
-   [parallel](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/parallel.md)  
  
-   [sections](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/sections-openmp.md)  
  
-   [single](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/single.md)  
  
 For more information, see [2.7.2.1 private](../../../parallel/openmp/2-7-2-1-private.md).
