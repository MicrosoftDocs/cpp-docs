# OpenMP Libraries
Discusses the .lib files that make up the OpenMP run-time libraries in Visual C++.  
  
 The following libraries contain the Visual C++ OpenMP run-time library functions.  
  
|OpenMP run-time library|Characteristics|  
|------------------------------|---------------------|  
|VCOMP.LIB|Multithreaded, dynamic link (import library for VCOMP.LIB).|  
|VCOMPD.LIB|Multithreaded, dynamic link (import library for VCOMPD.LID) (debug)|  
  
 If _DEBUG is defined in a compilation and if `#include omp.h` is in source code, VCOMPD.LIB will be the default lib. Otherwise, VCOMP.LIB will be used.  
  
 You can use [/NODEFAULTLIB (Ignore Libraries)](../../../build/reference/nodefaultlib-ignore-libraries.md) to remove the default lib and explicitly link with the lib of your choice.  
  
 The OpenMP DLLs are in the Visual C++ redistributable directory and need to be distributed with applications that use OpenMP.
