# OpenMP libraries

Discusses the .lib files that make up the OpenMP run-time libraries in Visual C++.

The following libraries contain the Visual C++ OpenMP run-time library functions.

|OpenMP run-time library|Characteristics|
|------------------------------|---------------------|
|VCOMP.LIB|Multithreaded, dynamic link (import library for VCOMP.LIB).|
|VCOMPD.LIB|Multithreaded, dynamic link (import library for VCOMPD.LID) (debug)|

If _DEBUG is defined in a compilation and if `#include omp.h` is in source code, VCOMPD.LIB will be the default lib. Otherwise, VCOMP.LIB will be used.

You can use [/NODEFAULTLIB (ignore libraries)](../../../build/reference/nodefaultlib-ignore-libraries.md) to remove the default lib and explicitly link with the lib of your choice.

The OpenMP DLLs are in the Visual C++ redistributable directory and need to be distributed with applications that use OpenMP.
