# shared (OpenMP)
Specifies that one or more variables should be shared among all threads.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
shared(var)  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 where,  
  
 `var`  
 One or more variables to share. If more than one variable is specified, separate variable names with a comma.  
  
## Remarks  
 Another way to share variables among threads is with the [copyprivate](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/copyprivate.md) clause.  
  
 `shared` applies to the following directives:  
  
-   [for](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/for-openmp.md)  
  
-   [parallel](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/parallel.md)  
  
-   [sections](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/sections-openmp.md)  
  
 For more information, see [2.7.2.4 shared](../../../parallel/openmp/2-7-2-4-shared.md).  
  
## Example  
 See [private](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/private-openmp.md) for an example of using `shared`.
