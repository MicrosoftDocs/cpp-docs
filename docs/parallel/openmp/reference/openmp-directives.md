# OpenMP Directives

Provides links to directives used in the OpenMP API.

Visual C++ supports the following OpenMP directives.

For parallel work-sharing:

|Directive|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|[parallel](#parallel)|Defines a parallel region, which is code that will be executed by multiple threads in parallel.|
|[for](#for-openmp)|Causes the work done in a `for` loop inside a parallel region to be divided among threads.|
|[sections](#sections-openmp)|Identifies code sections to be divided among all threads.|
|[single](#single)|Lets you specify that a section of code should be executed on a single thread, not necessarily the main thread.|

For main thread and synchronization:

|Directive|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|[master](#master)|Specifies that only the main thread should execute a section of the program.|
|[critical](#critical)|Specifies that code is only executed on one thread at a time.|
|[barrier](#barrier)|Synchronizes all threads in a team; all threads pause at the barrier, until all threads execute the barrier.|
|[atomic](#atomic)|Specifies that a memory location will be updated atomically.|
|[flush](#flush-openmp)|Specifies that all threads have the same view of memory for all shared objects.|
|[ordered](#ordered-openmp-directives)|Specifies that code under a parallelized `for` loop should be executed like a sequential loop.|

For data environment:

|Directive|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|[threadprivate](#threadprivate)|Specifies that a variable is private to a thread.|

## <a name="atomic"></a> atomic

Specifies that a memory location that will be updated atomically.

```cpp
#pragma omp atomic
   expression
```

### Parameters

*expression*<br/>
The statement that has the *lvalue*, whose memory location you want to protect against more than one write.

### Remarks

The `atomic` directive supports no clauses.

For more information, see [2.6.4 atomic construct](../2-directives.md#264-atomic-construct).

### Example

```cpp
// omp_atomic.cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

#define MAX 10

int main() {
   int count = 0;
   #pragma omp parallel num_threads(MAX)
   {
      #pragma omp atomic
      count++;
   }
   printf_s("Number of threads: %d\n", count);
}
```

```Output
Number of threads: 10
```

## <a name="barrier"></a> barrier

Synchronizes all threads in a team; all threads pause at the barrier, until all threads execute the barrier.

```cpp
#pragma omp barrier
```

### Remarks

The `barrier` directive supports no clauses.

For more information, see [2.6.3 barrier directive](../2-directives.md#263-barrier-directive).

### Example

For a sample of how to use `barrier`, see [master](#master).

## <a name="critical"></a> critical

Specifies that code is only be executed on one thread at a time.

```cpp
#pragma omp critical [(name)]
{
   code_block
}
```

### Parameters

*name*<br/>
(Optional) A name to identify the critical code. The name must be enclosed in parentheses.

### Remarks

The `critical` directive supports no clauses.

For more information, see [2.6.2 critical construct](../2-directives.md#262-critical-construct).

### Example

```cpp
// omp_critical.cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define SIZE 10

int main()
{
    int i;
    int max;
    int a[SIZE];

    for (i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
    {
        a[i] = rand();
        printf_s("%d\n", a[i]);
    }

    max = a[0];
    #pragma omp parallel for num_threads(4)
        for (i = 1; i < SIZE; i++)
        {
            if (a[i] > max)
            {
                #pragma omp critical
                {
                    // compare a[i] and max again because max
                    // could have been changed by another thread after
                    // the comparison outside the critical section
                    if (a[i] > max)
                        max = a[i];
                }
            }
        }

    printf_s("max = %d\n", max);
}
```

```

## <a name="flush-openmp"></a> flush

Specifies that all threads have the same view of memory for all shared objects.

```cpp
#pragma omp flush [(var)]
```

### Parameters

*var*<br/>
(Optional) A comma-separated list of variables that represent objects you want to synchronize. If *var* isn't specified, all memory is flushed.

### Remarks

The `flush` directive supports no clauses.

For more information, see [2.6.5 flush directive](../2-directives.md#265-flush-directive).

### Example

```cpp
// omp_flush.cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <stdio.h>

void read(int *data) {
   printf_s("read data\n");
   *data = 1;
}

void process(int *data) {
   printf_s("process data\n");
   (*data)++;
}

int main() {
   int data;
   int flag;

   flag = 0;

   #pragma omp parallel sections num_threads(2)
   {
      #pragma omp section
      {
         printf_s("Thread %d: ", omp_get_thread_num( ));
         read(&data);
         #pragma omp flush(data)
         flag = 1;
         #pragma omp flush(flag)
         // Do more work.
      }

      #pragma omp section
      {
         while (!flag) {
            #pragma omp flush(flag)
         }
         #pragma omp flush(data)

         printf_s("Thread %d: ", omp_get_thread_num( ));
         process(&data);
         printf_s("data = %d\n", data);
      }
   }
}
```

```Output
Thread 0: read data
Thread 1: process data
data = 2
```

## <a name="for-openmp"></a> for

Causes the work done in a `for` loop inside a parallel region to be divided among threads.

```cpp
#pragma omp [parallel] for [clauses]
   for_statement
```

### Parameters

*clauses*<br/>
(Optional) Zero or more clauses, see the **Remarks** section.

*for_statement*<br/>
A `for` loop. Undefined behavior will result if user code in the `for` loop changes the index variable.

### Remarks

The `for` directive supports the following clauses:

- [private](openmp-clauses.md#private-openmp)
- [firstprivate](openmp-clauses.md#firstprivate)
- [lastprivate](openmp-clauses.md#lastprivate)
- [reduction](openmp-clauses.md#reduction)
- [ordered](openmp-clauses.md#ordered-openmp-clauses)
- [schedule](openmp-clauses.md#schedule)
- [nowait](openmp-clauses.md#nowait)

If `parallel` is also specified, `clauses` can be any clause accepted by the `parallel` or `for` directives, except `nowait`.

For more information, see [2.4.1 for construct](../2-directives.md#241-for-construct).

### Example

```cpp
// omp_for.cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <omp.h>

#define NUM_THREADS 4
#define NUM_START 1
#define NUM_END 10

int main() {
   int i, nRet = 0, nSum = 0, nStart = NUM_START, nEnd = NUM_END;
   int nThreads = 0, nTmp = nStart + nEnd;
   unsigned uTmp = (unsigned((abs(nStart - nEnd) + 1)) *
                               unsigned(abs(nTmp))) / 2;
   int nSumCalc = uTmp;

   if (nTmp < 0)
      nSumCalc = -nSumCalc;

   omp_set_num_threads(NUM_THREADS);

   #pragma omp parallel default(none) private(i) shared(nSum, nThreads, nStart, nEnd)
   {
      #pragma omp master
      nThreads = omp_get_num_threads();

      #pragma omp for
      for (i=nStart; i<=nEnd; ++i) {
            #pragma omp atomic
            nSum += i;
      }
   }

   if  (nThreads == NUM_THREADS) {
      printf_s("%d OpenMP threads were used.\n", NUM_THREADS);
      nRet = 0;
   }
   else {
      printf_s("Expected %d OpenMP threads, but %d were used.\n",
               NUM_THREADS, nThreads);
      nRet = 1;
   }

   if (nSum != nSumCalc) {
      printf_s("The sum of %d through %d should be %d, "
               "but %d was reported!\n",
               NUM_START, NUM_END, nSumCalc, nSum);
      nRet = 1;
   }
   else
      printf_s("The sum of %d through %d is %d\n",
               NUM_START, NUM_END, nSum);
}
```

```Output
4 OpenMP threads were used.
The sum of 1 through 10 is 55
```

## <a name="master"></a> master

Specifies that only the main thread should execute a section of the program.

```cpp
#pragma omp master
{
   code_block
}
```

### Remarks

The `master` directive supports no clauses.

For more information, see [2.6.1 master construct](../2-directives.md#261-master-construct).

To specify that a section of code should be executed on a single thread, not necessarily the main thread, use the [single](#single) directive instead.

### Example

```cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main( )
{
    int a[5], i;

    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        // Perform some computation.
        #pragma omp for
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            a[i] = i * i;

        // Print intermediate results.
        #pragma omp master
            for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
                printf_s("a[%d] = %d\n", i, a[i]);

        // Wait.
        #pragma omp barrier

        // Continue with the computation.
        #pragma omp for
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            a[i] += i;
    }
}
```

```Output
a[0] = 0
a[1] = 1
a[2] = 4
a[3] = 9
a[4] = 16
```

## <a name="ordered-openmp-directives"></a> ordered

Specifies that code under a parallelized `for` loop should be executed like a sequential loop.

```cpp
#pragma omp ordered
   structured-block
```

### Remarks

The `ordered` directive must be within the dynamic extent of a [for](#for-openmp) or `parallel for` construct with an `ordered` clause.

The `ordered` directive supports no clauses.

For more information, see [2.6.6 ordered construct](../2-directives.md#266-ordered-construct).

### Example

```cpp
// omp_ordered.cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

static float a[1000], b[1000], c[1000];

void test(int first, int last)
{
    #pragma omp for schedule(static) ordered
    for (int i = first; i <= last; ++i) {
        // Do something here.
        if (i % 2)
        {
            #pragma omp ordered
            printf_s("test() iteration %d\n", i);
        }
    }
}

void test2(int iter)
{
    #pragma omp ordered
    printf_s("test2() iteration %d\n", iter);
}

int main( )
{
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        test(1, 8);
        #pragma omp for ordered
        for (i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i++)
            test2(i);
    }
}
```

```Output
test() iteration 1
test() iteration 3
test() iteration 5
test() iteration 7
test2() iteration 0
test2() iteration 1
test2() iteration 2
test2() iteration 3
test2() iteration 4
```

## <a name="parallel"></a> parallel

Defines a parallel region, which is code that will be executed by multiple threads in parallel.

```cpp
#pragma omp parallel [clauses]
{
   code_block
}
```

### Parameters

*clauses*<br/>
(Optional) Zero or more clauses, see the **Remarks** section.

### Remarks

The `parallel` directive supports the following clauses:

- [if](openmp-clauses.md#if-openmp)
- [private](openmp-clauses.md#private-openmp)
- [firstprivate](openmp-clauses.md#firstprivate)
- [default](openmp-clauses.md#default-openmp)
- [shared](openmp-clauses.md#shared-openmp)
- [copyin](openmp-clauses.md#copyin)
- [reduction](openmp-clauses.md#reduction)
- [num_threads](openmp-clauses.md#num-threads)

`parallel` can also be used with the [for](#for-openmp) and [sections](#sections-openmp) directives.

For more information, see [2.3 parallel construct](../2-directives.md#23-parallel-construct).

### Example

The following sample shows how to set the number of threads and define a parallel region. The number of threads is equal by default to the number of logical processors on the machine. For example, if you have a machine with one physical processor that has hyperthreading enabled, it will have two logical processors and two threads. The order of output can vary on different machines.

```cpp
// omp_parallel.cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
   #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4)
   {
      int i = omp_get_thread_num();
      printf_s("Hello from thread %d\n", i);
   }
}
```

```Output
Hello from thread 0
Hello from thread 1
Hello from thread 2
Hello from thread 3
```

## <a name="sections-openmp"></a> sections

Identifies code sections to be divided among all threads.

```cpp
#pragma omp [parallel] sections [clauses]
{
   #pragma omp section
   {
      code_block
   }
}
```

### Parameters

*clauses*<br/>
(Optional) Zero or more clauses, see the **Remarks** section.

### Remarks

The `sections` directive can contain zero or more `section` directives.

The `sections` directive supports the following clauses:

- [private](openmp-clauses.md#private-openmp)
- [firstprivate](openmp-clauses.md#firstprivate)
- [lastprivate](openmp-clauses.md#lastprivate)
- [reduction](openmp-clauses.md#reduction)
- [nowait](openmp-clauses.md#nowait)

If `parallel` is also specified, `clauses` can be any clause accepted by the `parallel` or `sections` directives, except `nowait`.

For more information, see [2.4.2 sections construct](../2-directives.md#242-sections-construct).

### Example

```cpp
// omp_sections.cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    #pragma omp parallel sections num_threads(4)
    {
        printf_s("Hello from thread %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
        #pragma omp section
        printf_s("Hello from thread %d\n", omp_get_thread_num());
    }
}
```

```Output
Hello from thread 0
Hello from thread 0
```

## <a name="single"></a> single

Lets you specify that a section of code should be executed on a single thread, not necessarily the main thread.

```cpp
#pragma omp single [clauses]
{
   code_block
}
```

### Parameters

*clauses*<br/>
(Optional) Zero or more clauses, see the **Remarks** section.

### Remarks

The `single` directive supports the following clauses:

- [private](openmp-clauses.md#private-openmp)
- [firstprivate](openmp-clauses.md#firstprivate)
- [copyprivate](openmp-clauses.md#copyprivate)
- [nowait](openmp-clauses.md#nowait)

For more information, see [2.4.3 single construct](../2-directives.md#243-single-construct).

To specify that a section of code should only be executed on the main thread, use the [master](#master) directive instead.

### Example

```cpp
// omp_single.cpp
// compile with: /openmp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
   #pragma omp parallel num_threads(2)
   {
      #pragma omp single
      // Only a single thread can read the input.
      printf_s("read input\n");

      // Multiple threads in the team compute the results.
      printf_s("compute results\n");

      #pragma omp single
      // Only a single thread can write the output.
      printf_s("write output\n");
    }
}
```

```Output
read input
compute results
compute results
write output
```

## <a name="threadprivate"></a> threadprivate

Specifies that a variable is private to a thread.

```cpp
#pragma omp threadprivate(var)
```

### Parameters

*var*<br/>
A comma-separated list of variables that you want to make private to a thread. *var* must be either a global- or namespace-scoped variable or a local static variable.

### Remarks

The `threadprivate` directive supports no clauses.

The `threadprivate` directive is based on the [thread](../../../cpp/thread.md) attribute using the [__declspec](../../../cpp/declspec.md) keyword; limits on `__declspec(thread)` apply to `threadprivate`. For example, a `threadprivate` variable will exist in any thread started in the process, not just those threads that are part of a thread team spawned by a parallel region. Be aware of this implementation detail; you may notice that constructors for a `threadprivate` user-defined type are called more often then expected.

You can use `threadprivate` in a DLL that is statically loaded at process startup, however you can't use `threadprivate` in any DLL that will be loaded via [LoadLibrary](/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibraryw) such as DLLs that are loaded with [/DELAYLOAD (delay load import)](../../../build/reference/delayload-delay-load-import.md), which also uses `LoadLibrary`.

A `threadprivate` variable of a *destructible* type isn't guaranteed to have its destructor called. For example:

```cpp
struct MyType
{
    ~MyType();
};

MyType threaded_var;
#pragma omp threadprivate(threaded_var)
int main()
{
    #pragma omp parallel
    {}
}
```

Users have no control as to when the threads constituting the parallel region will terminate. If those threads exist when the process exits, the threads won't be notified about the process exit, and the destructor won't be called for `threaded_var` on any thread except the one that exits (here, the primary thread). So code shouldn't count on proper destruction of `threadprivate` variables.

For more information, see [2.7.1 threadprivate directive](../2-directives.md#271-threadprivate-directive).

### Example

For a sample of using `threadprivate`, see [private](openmp-clauses.md#private-openmp).
