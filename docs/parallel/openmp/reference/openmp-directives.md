# OpenMP Directives
Provides links to directives used in the OpenMP API.  
  
 Visual C++ supports the following OpenMP directives:  
  
|Directive|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[atomic](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/atomic.md)|Specifies that a memory location that will be updated atomically.|  
|[barrier](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/barrier.md)|Synchronizes all threads in a team; all threads pause at the barrier, until all threads execute the barrier.|  
|[critical](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/critical.md)|Specifies that code is only executed on one thread at a time.|  
|[flush](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/flush-openmp.md)|Specifies that all threads have the same view of memory for all shared objects.|  
|[for](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/for-openmp.md)|Causes the work done in a for loop inside a parallel region to be divided among threads.|  
|[master](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/master.md)|Specifies that only the master threadshould execute a section of the program.|  
|[ordered](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/ordered-openmp-directives.md)|Specifies that code under a parallelized for loop should be executed like a sequential loop.|  
|[parallel](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/parallel.md)|Defines a parallel region, which is code that will be executed by multiple threads in parallel.|  
|[sections](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/sections-openmp.md)|Identifies code sections to be divided among all threads.|  
|[single](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/single.md)|Lets you specify that a section of code should be executed on a single thread, not necessarily the master thread.|  
|[threadprivate](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/threadprivate.md)|Specifies that a variable is private to a thread.|
