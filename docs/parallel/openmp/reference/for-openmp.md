# for (OpenMP)
Causes the work done in a for loop inside a parallel region to be divided among threads.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#pragma omp [parallel] for [clauses]  
   for_statement  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 where,  
  
 `clause` (optional)  
 Zero or more clauses. See the Remarks section for a list of the clauses supported by **for**.  
  
 `for_statement`  
 A for loop. Undefined behavior will result if user code in the for loop changes the index variable.  
  
## Remarks  
 The **for** directive supports the following OpenMP clauses:  
  
-   [firstprivate](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/firstprivate.md)  
  
-   [lastprivate](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/lastprivate.md)  
  
-   [nowait](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/nowait.md)  
  
-   [ordered](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/ordered-openmp-directives.md)  
  
-   [private](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/private-openmp.md)  
  
-   [reduction](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/reduction.md)  
  
-   [schedule](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/schedule.md)  
  
 If **parallel** is also specified, `clause` can be any clause accepted by the **parallel** or **for** directives, except **nowait**.  
  
 For more information, see [2.4.1 for Construct](../../../parallel/openmp/2-4-1-for-construct.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// omp_for.cpp  
// compile with: /openmp   
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <math.h>  
#include <omp.h>  
  
#define NUM_THREADS 4  
#define NUM_START 1  
#define NUM_END 10  
  
int main() {  
   int i, nRet = 0, nSum = 0, nStart = NUM_START, nEnd = NUM_END;  
   int nThreads = 0, nTmp = nStart + nEnd;  
   unsigned uTmp = (unsigned((abs(nStart - nEnd) + 1)) *   
                               unsigned(abs(nTmp))) / 2;  
   int nSumCalc = uTmp;  
  
   if (nTmp < 0)  
      nSumCalc = -nSumCalc;  
  
   omp_set_num_threads(NUM_THREADS);  
  
   #pragma omp parallel default(none) private(i) shared(nSum, nThreads, nStart, nEnd)  
   {  
      #pragma omp master  
      nThreads = omp_get_num_threads();  
  
      #pragma omp for  
      for (i=nStart; i<=nEnd; ++i) {  
            #pragma omp atomic  
            nSum += i;  
      }  
   }  
  
   if  (nThreads == NUM_THREADS) {  
      printf_s("%d OpenMP threads were used.\n", NUM_THREADS);  
      nRet = 0;  
   }  
   else {  
      printf_s("Expected %d OpenMP threads, but %d were used.\n",  
               NUM_THREADS, nThreads);  
      nRet = 1;  
   }  
  
   if (nSum != nSumCalc) {  
      printf_s("The sum of %d through %d should be %d, "  
               "but %d was reported!\n",  
               NUM_START, NUM_END, nSumCalc, nSum);  
      nRet = 1;  
   }  
   else  
      printf_s("The sum of %d through %d is %d\n",  
               NUM_START, NUM_END, nSum);  
}  
```  
  
```Output  
4 OpenMP threads were used.  
The sum of 1 through 10 is 55  
```
