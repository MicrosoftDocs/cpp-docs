# omp_test_lock
Attempts to set a lock but does not block thread execution.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
int omp_test_lock(  
   omp_lock_t *lock  
);  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 where,  
  
 `lock`  
 A variable of type [omp_lock_t](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/omp-lock-t.md) that was initialized with [omp_init_lock](../../../parallel/openmp/reference/omp-init-lock.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 For more information, see [3.2.5 omp_test_lock and omp_test_nest_lock Functions](../../../parallel/openmp/3-2-5-omp-test-lock-and-omp-test-nest-lock-functions.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// omp_test_lock.cpp  
// compile with: /openmp  
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <omp.h>  
  
omp_lock_t simple_lock;                   
  
int main() {  
    omp_init_lock(&simple_lock);  
  
    #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4)  
    {  
        int tid = omp_get_thread_num();  
  
        while (!omp_test_lock(&simple_lock))  
            printf_s("Thread %d - failed to acquire simple_lock\n",  
                     tid);  
  
        printf_s("Thread %d - acquired simple_lock\n", tid);  
  
        printf_s("Thread %d - released simple_lock\n", tid);  
        omp_unset_lock(&simple_lock);  
    }  
  
    omp_destroy_lock(&simple_lock);  
}  
```
