# A.2   Specifying Conditional Compilation
The following examples illustrate the use of conditional compilation using the OpenMP macro `_OPENMP` ([Section 2.2](../../parallel/openmp/2-2-conditional-compilation.md) on page 8). With OpenMP compilation, the `_OPENMP` macro becomes defined.  
  
```  
# ifdef _OPENMP   
    printf_s("Compiled by an OpenMP-compliant implementation.\n");  
# endif  
```  
  
 The defined preprocessor operator allows more than one macro to be tested in a single directive.  
  
```  
# if defined(_OPENMP) && defined(VERBOSE)  
    printf_s("Compiled by an OpenMP-compliant implementation.\n");  
# endif  
```
