# 2.5.2 parallel sections Construct
The **parallel sections** directive provides a shortcut form for specifying a **parallel** region containing only a single **sections** directive. The semantics are identical to explicitly specifying a **parallel** directive immediately followed by a **sections** directive. The syntax of the **parallel sections** directive is as follows:  
  
```  
#pragma omp parallel sections  [clause[[,] clause] ...] new-line  
   {  
   [#pragma omp section new-line]  
      structured-block  
   [#pragma omp section new-linestructured-block  ]  
   ...  
}  
```  
  
 The *clause* can be one of the clauses accepted by the **parallel** and **sections** directives, except the **nowait** clause.
