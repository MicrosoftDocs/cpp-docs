# 3.1.4 omp_get_thread_num Function
The `omp_get_thread_num` function returns the thread number, within its team, of the thread executing the function. The thread number lies between 0 and **omp_get_num_threads()**-1, inclusive. The master thread of the team is thread 0.  
  
 The format is as follows:  
  
```  
#include <omp.h>  
int omp_get_thread_num(void);  
```  
  
 If called from a serial region, `omp_get_thread_num` returns 0. If called from within a nested parallel region that is serialized, this function returns 0.
