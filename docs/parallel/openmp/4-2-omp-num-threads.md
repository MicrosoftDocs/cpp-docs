# 4.2 OMP_NUM_THREADS
The **OMP_NUM_THREADS** environment variable sets the default number of threads to use during execution, unless that number is explicitly changed by calling the **omp_set_num_threads** library routine or by an explicit **num_threads** clause on a **parallel** directive.  
  
 The value of the **OMP_NUM_THREADS** environment variable must be a positive integer. Its effect depends upon whether dynamic adjustment of the number of threads is enabled. For a comprehensive set of rules about the interaction between the **OMP_NUM_THREADS** environment variable and dynamic adjustment of threads, see Section 2.3 on page 8.  
  
 If no value is specified for the **OMP_NUM_THREADS** environment variable, or if the value specified is not a positive integer, or if the value is greater than the maximum number of threads the system can support, the number of threads to use is implementation-defined.  
  
 Example:  
  
```  
setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 16  
```
