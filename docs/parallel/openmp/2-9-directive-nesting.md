# 2.9 Directive Nesting
Dynamic nesting of directives must adhere to the following rules:  
  
-   A **parallel** directive dynamically inside another **parallel** logically establishes a new team, which is composed of only the current thread, unless nested parallelism is enabled.  
  
-   **for**, **sections**, and **single** directives that bind to the same **parallel** are not allowed to be nested inside each other.  
  
-   **critical** directives with the same name are not allowed to be nested inside each other. Note this restriction is not sufficient to prevent deadlock.  
  
-   **for**, **sections**, and **single** directives are not permitted in the dynamic extent of **critical**, **ordered**, and **master** regions if the directives bind to the same **parallel** as the regions.  
  
-   **barrier** directives are not permitted in the dynamic extent of **for**, **ordered**, **sections**, **single**, **master**, and **critical** regions if the directives bind to the same **parallel** as the regions.  
  
-   **master** directives are not permitted in the dynamic extent of **for**, **sections**, and **single** directives if the **master** directives bind to the same **parallel** as the work-sharing directives.  
  
-   **ordered** directives are not allowed in the dynamic extent of **critical** regions if the directives bind to the same **parallel** as the regions.  
  
-   Any directive that is permitted when executed dynamically inside a parallel region is also permitted when executed outside a parallel region. When executed dynamically outside a user-specified parallel region, the directive is executed by a team composed of only the master thread.
