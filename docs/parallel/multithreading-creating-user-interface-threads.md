# Multithreading: Creating MFC User-Interface Threads
A user-interface thread is commonly used to handle user input and respond to user events independently of threads executing other portions of the application. The main application thread (provided in your `CWinApp`-derived class) is already created and started for you. This topic describes the steps necessary to create additional user-interface threads.  
  
The first thing you must do when creating a user-interface thread is derive a class from [CWinThread](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md). You must declare and implement this class, using the [DECLARE_DYNCREATE](../mfc/reference/run-time-object-model-services.md#declare_dyncreate) and [IMPLEMENT_DYNCREATE](../mfc/reference/run-time-object-model-services.md#implement_dyncreate) macros. This class must override some functions and can override others. These functions and what they should do are presented in the following table.  
  
### Functions to Override When Creating a User-Interface Thread  
  
|Function|Purpose|  
|--------------|-------------|  
|[ExitInstance](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md#exitinstance)|Perform cleanup when thread terminates. Usually overridden.|  
|[InitInstance](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md#initinstance)|Perform thread instance initialization. Must be overridden.|  
|[OnIdle](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md#onidle)|Perform thread-specific idle-time processing. Not usually overridden.|  
|[PreTranslateMessage](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md#pretranslatemessage)|Filter messages before they are dispatched to `TranslateMessage` and `DispatchMessage`. Not usually overridden.|  
|[ProcessWndProcException](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md#processwndprocexception)|Intercept unhandled exceptions thrown by the thread's message and command handlers. Not usually overridden.|  
|[Run](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md#run)|Controlling function for the thread. Contains the message pump. Rarely overridden.|  

  
MFC provides two versions of `AfxBeginThread` through parameter overloading: one that can only create worker threads and one that can create user-interface threads or worker threads. To start your user-interface thread, call the second overload of [AfxBeginThread](../mfc/reference/application-information-and-management.md#afxbeginthread), providing the following information:  
  
- The [RUNTIME_CLASS](../mfc/reference/run-time-object-model-services.md#runtime_class) of the class you derived from `CWinThread`.  
  
- (Optional) The desired priority level. The default is normal priority. For more information about the available priority levels, see [SetThreadPriority](/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreadpriority) in the Windows SDK.  
  
- (Optional) The desired stack size for the thread. The default is the same size stack as the creating thread.  
  
- (Optional) CREATE_SUSPENDED if you want the thread to be created in a suspended state. The default is 0, or start the thread normally.  
  
- (Optional) The desired security attributes. The default is the same access as the parent thread. For more information about the format of this security information, see [SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa379560) in the Windows SDK.  
  
`AfxBeginThread` does most of the work for you. It creates a new object of your class, initializes it with the information you supply, and calls [CWinThread::CreateThread](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md#createthread) to start executing the thread. Checks are made throughout the procedure to make sure all objects are deallocated properly should any part of the creation fail.
