# Library Support for Multithreading
All versions of the CRT now support multi threading with the exception of the non-locking versions of some functions. See [Multithreaded Libraries Performance](../c-runtime-library/multithreaded-libraries-performance.md) for more information.  
  
 See [CRT Library Features](../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md) for more information on CRT versions.
