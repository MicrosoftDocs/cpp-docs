# Multithreading Support for Older Code (Visual C++)

Visual C++ allows you to have multiple concurrent threads of execution running simultaneously. With multithreading, you can spin off background tasks, manage simultaneous streams of input, manage a user interface, and much more.

## In This Section

[Multithreading with C and Win32](multithreading-with-c-and-win32.md)<br/>
Provides support for creating multithread applications with Microsoft Windows

[Multithreading with C++ and MFC](multithreading-with-cpp-and-mfc.md)<br/>
Describes what processes and threads are and what the MFC approach to multithreading is.

[Multithreading and Locales](multithreading-and-locales.md)<br/>
Discusses issues that arise when using the locale functionality of both the C Runtime Library and the C++ Standard Library in a multithreaded application.

## Related Sections

[CWinThread](../mfc/reference/cwinthread-class.md)<br/>
Represents a thread of execution within an application.

[CSyncObject](../mfc/reference/csyncobject-class.md)<br/>
Describes a pure virtual class that provides functionality common to the synchronization objects in Win32.

[CSemaphore](../mfc/reference/csemaphore-class.md)<br/>
Represents a semaphore, which is a synchronization object that allows a limited number of threads in one or more processes to access a resource.

[CMutex](../mfc/reference/cmutex-class.md)<br/>
Represents a mutex, which is a synchronization object that allows one thread mutually exclusive access to a resource.

[CCriticalSection](../mfc/reference/ccriticalsection-class.md)<br/>
Represents a critical section, which is a synchronization object that allows one thread at a time to access a resource or section of code.

[CEvent](../mfc/reference/cevent-class.md)<br/>
Represents an event, which is a synchronization object that allows one thread to notify another that an event has occurred.

[CMultiLock](../mfc/reference/cmultilock-class.md)<br/>
Represents the access-control mechanism used in controlling access to resources in a multithreaded program.

[CSingleLock](../mfc/reference/csinglelock-class.md)<br/>
Represents the access-control mechanism used in controlling access to a resource in a multithreaded program.
