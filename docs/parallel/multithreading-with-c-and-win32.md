# Multithreading with C and Win32
Microsoft Visual C++ provides support for creating multithread applications. You should consider using more than one thread if your application needs to perform expensive operations that would cause the user-interface to become unresponsive.  
  
With Visual C++, there are two ways to program with multiple threads: use the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library or the C run-time library and the Win32 API. For information about creating multithread applications with MFC, see [Multithreading with C++ and MFC](../parallel/multithreading-with-cpp-and-mfc.md) after reading the following topics about multithreading in C.  
  
These topics explain the features in Visual C++ that support the creation of multithread programs.
