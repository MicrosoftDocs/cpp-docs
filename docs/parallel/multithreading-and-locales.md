# Multithreading and Locales
Both the C Runtime Library and the C++ Standard Library provide support for changing the locale of your program. This topic discusses issues that arise when using the locale functionality of both libraries in a multithreaded application.  
  
## Remarks  

With the C Runtime Library, you can create multithreaded applications using the `_beginthread` and `_beginthreadex` functions. This topic only covers multithreaded applications created using these functions. For more information, see [_beginthread, _beginthreadex](../c-runtime-library/reference/beginthread-beginthreadex.md).  
  
To change the locale using the C Runtime Library, use the [setlocale](../preprocessor/setlocale.md) function. In previous versions of Visual C++, this function would always modify the locale throughout the entire application. There is now support for setting the locale on a per-thread basis. This is done using the [_configthreadlocale](../c-runtime-library/reference/configthreadlocale.md) function. To specify that [setlocale](../preprocessor/setlocale.md) should only change the locale in the current thread, call `_configthreadlocale(_ENABLE_PER_THREAD_LOCALE)` in that thread. Conversely, calling `_configthreadlocale(_DISABLE_PER_THREAD_LOCALE)` will cause that thread to use the global locale, and any call to [setlocale](../preprocessor/setlocale.md) in that thread will change the locale in all threads that have not explicitly enabled per-thread locale.  
  
To change the locale using the C++ Runtime Library, use the [locale Class](../standard-library/locale-class.md). By calling the [locale::global](../standard-library/locale-class.md#global) method, you change the locale in every thread that has not explicitly enabled per-thread locale. To change the locale in a single thread or portion of an application, simply create an instance of a `locale` object in that thread or portion of code.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Calling [locale::global](../standard-library/locale-class.md#global) changes the locale for both the C++ Standard Library and the C Runtime Library. However, calling [setlocale](../preprocessor/setlocale.md) only changes the locale for the C Runtime Library; the C++ Standard Library is not affected.  
  
The following examples show how to use the [setlocale](../preprocessor/setlocale.md) function, the [locale Class](../standard-library/locale-class.md), and the [_configthreadlocale](../c-runtime-library/reference/configthreadlocale.md) function to change the locale of an application in several different scenarios.  
  
## Example  
 
In this example, the main thread spawns two child threads. The first thread, Thread A, enables per-thread locale by calling `_configthreadlocale(_ENABLE_PER_THREAD_LOCALE)`. The second thread, Thread B, as well as the main thread, do not enable per-thread locale. Thread A then proceeds to change the locale using the [setlocale](../preprocessor/setlocale.md) function of the C Runtime Library.  
  
Since Thread A has per-thread locale enabled, only the C Runtime Library functions in Thread A start using the "french" locale. The C Runtime Library functions in Thread B and in the main thread continue to use the "C" locale. Also, since [setlocale](../preprocessor/setlocale.md) does not affect the C++ Standard Library locale, all C++ Standard Library objects continue to use the "C" locale.
