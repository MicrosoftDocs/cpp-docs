# Message Passing Functions
The Asynchronous Agents Library provides several functions that let you pass messages among components.  
  
 These message-passing functions are used with the various message-block types. For more information about the message-block types that are defined by the Concurrency Runtime, see [Asynchronous Message Blocks](../../parallel/concrt/asynchronous-message-blocks.md).  
  
##  <a name="top"></a> Sections  
 This topic describes the following message-passing functions:  
  
-   [send and asend](#send)  
  
-   [receive and try_receive](#receive)  
  
-   [Examples](#examples)  
  
##  <a name="send"></a> send and asend  

 The [concurrency::send](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#send) function sends a message to the specified target synchronously and the [concurrency::asend](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#asend) function sends a message to the specified target asynchronously. Both the `send` and `asend` functions wait until the target indicates that it will eventually accept or decline the message.  
  
 The `send` function waits until the target accepts or declines the message before it returns. The `send` function returns `true` if the message was delivered and `false` otherwise. Because the `send` function works synchronously, the `send` function waits for the target to receive the message before it returns.  
  
 Conversely, the `asend` function does not wait for the target to accept or decline the message before it returns. Instead, the `asend` function returns `true` if the target accepts the message and will eventually take it. Otherwise, `asend` returns `false` to indicate that the target either declined the message or postponed the decision about whether to take the message.

##  <a name="receive"></a> receive and try_receive  

 The [concurrency::receive](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#receive) and [concurrency::try_receive](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#try_receive) functions read data from a given source. The `receive` function waits for data to become available, whereas the `try_receive` function returns immediately.  
  
 Use the `receive` function when you must have the data to continue. Use the `try_receive` function if you must not block the current context or you do not have to have the data to continue.
