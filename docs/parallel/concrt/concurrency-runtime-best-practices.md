# Concurrency Runtime Best Practices

This section describes best practices that can help you make effective use of the Concurrency Runtime. These best practices apply to the [Parallel Patterns Library](../../parallel/concrt/parallel-patterns-library-ppl.md) (PPL), the [Asynchronous Agents Library](../../parallel/concrt/asynchronous-agents-library.md), and the [Task Scheduler](../../parallel/concrt/task-scheduler-concurrency-runtime.md).

## In This Section

[Best Practices in the Parallel Patterns Library](../../parallel/concrt/best-practices-in-the-parallel-patterns-library.md)<br/>
Describes the best practices to follow when you use the Parallel Patterns Library (PPL).

[Best Practices in the Asynchronous Agents Library](../../parallel/concrt/best-practices-in-the-asynchronous-agents-library.md)<br/>
Describes the best practices to follow when you use the Asynchronous Agents Library.

[General Best Practices in the Concurrency Runtime](../../parallel/concrt/general-best-practices-in-the-concurrency-runtime.md)<br/>
Describes best practices that apply to multiple areas of the Concurrency Runtime.
