# Concurrency Runtime Best Practices
This section describes best practices that can help you make effective use of the Concurrency Runtime. These best practices apply to the [Parallel Patterns Library](../../parallel/concrt/parallel-patterns-library-ppl.md) (PPL), the [Asynchronous Agents Library](../../parallel/concrt/asynchronous-agents-library.md), and the [Task Scheduler](../../parallel/concrt/task-scheduler-concurrency-runtime.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Best Practices in the Parallel Patterns Library](../../parallel/concrt/best-practices-in-the-parallel-patterns-library.md)  
 Describes the best practices to follow when you use the Parallel Patterns Library (PPL).  
  
 [Best Practices in the Asynchronous Agents Library](../../parallel/concrt/best-practices-in-the-asynchronous-agents-library.md)  
 Describes the best practices to follow when you use the Asynchronous Agents Library.  
  
 [General Best Practices in the Concurrency Runtime](../../parallel/concrt/general-best-practices-in-the-concurrency-runtime.md)  
 Describes best practices that apply to multiple areas of the Concurrency Runtime.
