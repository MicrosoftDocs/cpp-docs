# Walkthrough: Implementing Futures

This topic shows how to implement futures in your application. The topic demonstrates how to combine existing functionality in the Concurrency Runtime into something that does more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic illustrates the concept of futures for demonstration purposes. We recommend that you use [std::future](../../standard-library/future-class.md) or [concurrency::task](../../parallel/concrt/reference/task-class.md) when you require an asynchronous task that computes a value for later use.

A *task* is a computation that can be decomposed into additional, more fine-grained, computations. A *future* is an asynchronous task that computes a value for later use.

To implement futures, this topic defines the `async_future` class. The `async_future` class uses these components of the Concurrency Runtime: the [concurrency::task_group](reference/task-group-class.md) class and the [concurrency::single_assignment](../../parallel/concrt/reference/single-assignment-class.md) class. The `async_future` class uses the `task_group` class to compute a value asynchronously and the `single_assignment` class to store the result of the computation. The constructor of the `async_future` class takes a work function that computes the result, and the `get` method retrieves the result.

### To implement the async_future class

1. Declare a template class named `async_future` that is parameterized on the type of the resulting computation. Add **`public`** and **`private`** sections to this class.

[!code-cpp[concrt-futures#2](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-implementing-futures_1.cpp)]

1. In the **`private`** section of the `async_future` class, declare a `task_group` and a `single_assignment` data member.

[!code-cpp[concrt-futures#3](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-implementing-futures_2.cpp)]

1. In the **`public`** section of the `async_future` class, implement the constructor. The constructor is a template that is parameterized on the work function that computes the result. The constructor asynchronously executes the work function in the `task_group` data member and uses the [concurrency::send](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#send) function to write the result to the `single_assignment` data member.

[!code-cpp[concrt-futures#4](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-implementing-futures_3.cpp)]

1. In the **`public`** section of the `async_future` class, implement the destructor. The destructor waits for the task to finish.

[!code-cpp[concrt-futures#5](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-implementing-futures_4.cpp)]

1. In the **`public`** section of the `async_future` class, implement the `get` method. This method uses the [concurrency::receive](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#receive) function to retrieve the result of the work function.

[!code-cpp[concrt-futures#6](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-implementing-futures_5.cpp)]

## Example

### Description

The following example shows the complete `async_future` class and an example of its usage. The `wmain` function creates a [std::vector](../../standard-library/vector-class.md) object that contains 10,000 random integer values. It then uses `async_future` objects to find the smallest and largest values that are contained in the `vector` object.

### Code

[!code-cpp[concrt-futures#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-implementing-futures_6.cpp)]

### Comments

This example produces the following output:

```Output
smallest: 0
largest:  9999
average:  4981
```

The example uses the `async_future::get` method to retrieve the results of the computation. The `async_future::get` method waits for the computation to finish if the computation is still active.

## Robust Programming

To extend the `async_future` class to handle exceptions that are thrown by the work function, modify the `async_future::get` method to call the [concurrency::task_group::wait](reference/task-group-class.md#wait) method. The `task_group::wait` method throws any exceptions that were generated by the work function.

The following example shows the modified version of the `async_future` class. The `wmain` function uses a **`try`**-**`catch`** block to print the result of the `async_future` object or to print the value of the exception that is generated by the work function.

[!code-cpp[concrt-futures-with-eh#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-implementing-futures_7.cpp)]

This example produces the following output:

```Output
caught exception: error
```

For more information about the exception handling model in the Concurrency Runtime, see [Exception Handling](../../parallel/concrt/exception-handling-in-the-concurrency-runtime.md).

## Compiling the Code

Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `futures.cpp` and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.

**cl.exe /EHsc futures.cpp**
