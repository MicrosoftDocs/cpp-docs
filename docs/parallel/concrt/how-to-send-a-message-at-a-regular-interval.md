# How to: Send a Message at a Regular Interval
This example shows how to use the concurrency::[timer class](../../parallel/concrt/reference/timer-class.md) to send a message at a regular interval.  
  
## Example  

 The following example uses a `timer` object to report progress during a lengthy operation. This example links the `timer` object to a [concurrency::call](../../parallel/concrt/reference/call-class.md) object. The `call` object prints a progress indicator to the console at a regular interval. The [concurrency::timer::start](reference/timer-class.md#start) method runs the timer on a separate context. The `perform_lengthy_operation` function calls the [concurrency::wait](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#wait) function on the main context to simulate a time-consuming operation.  

  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-report-progress#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/how-to-send-a-message-at-a-regular-interval_1.cpp)]  
  
 This example produces the following sample output:  
  
```Output  
Performing a lengthy operation..........done.  
```  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `report-progress.cpp` and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  
  
 **cl.exe /EHsc report-progress.cpp**
