# Task Scheduler (Concurrency Runtime)

The topics in this part of the documentation describe the important features of the Concurrency Runtime Task Scheduler. The Task Scheduler is useful when you want fine-tune the performance of your existing code that uses the Concurrency Runtime.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The Task Scheduler is not available from a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. For more information, see [Creating Asynchronous Operations in C++ for UWP Apps](../../parallel/concrt/creating-asynchronous-operations-in-cpp-for-windows-store-apps.md).
>
>  In Visual Studio 2015 and later, the [concurrency::task](../../parallel/concrt/reference/task-class.md) class and related types in ppltasks.h use the Windows ThreadPool as their scheduler. This topic no longer applies to types that are defined in ppltasks.h. Parallel algorithms such as parallel_for continue to use the Concurrency Runtime as the default scheduler.

> [!TIP]
>  The Concurrency Runtime provides a default scheduler, and therefore you are not required to create one in your application. Because the Task Scheduler helps you fine-tune the performance of your applications, we recommend that you start with the [Parallel Patterns Library (PPL)](../../parallel/concrt/parallel-patterns-library-ppl.md) or the [Asynchronous Agents Library](../../parallel/concrt/asynchronous-agents-library.md) if you are new to the Concurrency Runtime.

The Task Scheduler schedules and coordinates tasks at run time. A *task* is a unit of work that performs a specific job. A task can typically run in parallel with other tasks. The work that is performed by task group items, parallel algorithms, and asynchronous agents are all examples of tasks.

The Task Scheduler manages the details that are related to efficiently scheduling tasks on computers that have multiple computing resources. The Task Scheduler also uses the newest features of the underlying operating system. Therefore, applications that use the Concurrency Runtime automatically scale and improve on hardware that has expanded capabilities.

[Comparing to Other Concurrency Models](../../parallel/concrt/comparing-the-concurrency-runtime-to-other-concurrency-models.md) describes the differences between preemptive and cooperative scheduling mechanisms. The Task Scheduler uses cooperative scheduling and a work-stealing algorithm together with the preemptive scheduler of the operating system to achieve maximum usage of processing resources.

The Concurrency Runtime provides a default scheduler so that you do not have to manage infrastructure details. Therefore, you typically do not use the Task Scheduler directly. However, to meet the quality needs of your application, you can use the Task Scheduler to provide your own scheduling policy or associate schedulers with specific tasks. For example, suppose you have a parallel sorting routine that does not scale beyond four processors. You can use *scheduler policies* to create a scheduler that generates no more than four concurrent tasks. Running the sorting routine on this scheduler enables other active schedulers to use any remaining processing resources.
