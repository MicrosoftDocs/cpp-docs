# Walkthrough: Adapting Existing Code to Use Lightweight Tasks
This topic shows how to adapt existing code that uses the Windows API to create and execute a thread to use a lightweight task.  
  
 A *lightweight task* is a task that you schedule directly from a [concurrency::Scheduler](../../parallel/concrt/reference/scheduler-class.md) or [concurrency::ScheduleGroup](../../parallel/concrt/reference/schedulegroup-class.md) object. Lightweight tasks are useful when you adapt existing code to use the scheduling functionality of the Concurrency Runtime.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 Before you start this walkthrough, read the topic [Task Scheduler](../../parallel/concrt/task-scheduler-concurrency-runtime.md).  
  
## Example  
  
### Description  
 The following example illustrates typical usage of the Windows API to create and execute a thread. This example uses the [CreateThread](/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createthread) function to call the `MyThreadFunction` on a separate thread.  
  
### Code  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-windows-threads#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks_1.cpp)]  
  
### Comments  
 This example produces the following output.  
  
```Output  
Parameters = 50, 100  
```  
  
 The following steps show how to adapt the code example to use the Concurrency Runtime to perform the same task.  
  
### To adapt the example to use a lightweight task  
  
1.  Add a `#include` directive for the header file concrt.h.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-migration-lwt#2](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks_2.cpp)]  
  
2.  Add a `using` directive for the `concurrency` namespace.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-migration-lwt#3](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks_3.cpp)]  
  
3.  Change the declaration of `MyThreadFunction` to use the `__cdecl` calling convention and to return `void`.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-migration-lwt#4](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks_4.cpp)]  
  
4.  Modify the `MyData` structure to include a [concurrency::event](../../parallel/concrt/reference/event-class.md) object that signals to the main application that the task has finished.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-migration-lwt#5](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks_5.cpp)]  
  
5.  Replace the call to `CreateThread` with a call to the [concurrency::CurrentScheduler::ScheduleTask](reference/currentscheduler-class.md#scheduletask) method.  

  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-migration-lwt#6](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks_6.cpp)]  
  

6.  Replace the call to `WaitForSingleObject` with a call to the [concurrency::event::wait](reference/event-class.md#wait) method to wait for the task to finish.  

 [!code-cpp[concrt-migration-lwt#7](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks_7.cpp)]  
  
7.  Remove the call to `CloseHandle`.  
  
8.  Change the signature of the definition of `MyThreadFunction` to match step 3.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-migration-lwt#8](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks_8.cpp)]  
  
9. At the end of the `MyThreadFunction` function, call the [concurrency::event::set](reference/event-class.md#set) method to signal to the main application that the task has finished.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-migration-lwt#9](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks_9.cpp)]  
  
10. Remove the `return` statement from `MyThreadFunction`.  
  
## Example  
  
### Description  
 The following completed example shows code that uses a lightweight task to call the `MyThreadFunction` function.  
  
### Code  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-migration-lwt#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks_10.cpp)]
