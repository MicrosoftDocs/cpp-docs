# How to: Write a parallel_for_each Loop
This example shows how to use the [concurrency::parallel_for_each](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_for_each) algorithm to compute the count of prime numbers in a [std::array](../../standard-library/array-class-stl.md) object in parallel.  
  
## Example  
 The following example computes the count of prime numbers in an array two times. The example first uses the [std::for_each](../../standard-library/algorithm-functions.md#for_each) algorithm to compute the count serially. The example then uses the `parallel_for_each` algorithm to perform the same task in parallel. The example also prints to the console the time that is required to perform both computations.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-parallel-count-primes#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/how-to-write-a-parallel-for-each-loop_1.cpp)]  
  
 The following sample output is for a computer that has four processors.  
  
```Output  
serial version:  
found 17984 prime numbers  
took 6115 ms  
 
parallel version:  
found 17984 prime numbers  
took 1653 ms  
```  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 To compile the code, copy it and then paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `parallel-count-primes.cpp` and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  
  
 **cl.exe /EHsc parallel-count-primes.cpp**  
  
## Robust Programming  
 The lambda expression that the example passes to the `parallel_for_each` algorithm uses the `InterlockedIncrement` function to enable parallel iterations of the loop to increment the counter simultaneously. If you use functions such as `InterlockedIncrement` to synchronize access to shared resources, you can present performance bottlenecks in your code. You can use a lock-free synchronization mechanism, for example, the [concurrency::combinable](../../parallel/concrt/reference/combinable-class.md) class, to eliminate simultaneous access to shared resources. For an example that uses the `combinable` class in this manner, see [How to: Use combinable to Improve Performance](../../parallel/concrt/how-to-use-combinable-to-improve-performance.md).
