# How to: Convert an OpenMP Loop that Uses a Reduction Variable to Use the Concurrency Runtime
This example demonstrates how to convert an OpenMP [parallel](../../parallel/concrt/how-to-use-parallel-invoke-to-write-a-parallel-sort-routine.md#parallel)[for](../../parallel/openmp/reference/for-openmp.md) loop that uses the [reduction](../../parallel/openmp/reference/reduction.md) clause to use the Concurrency Runtime.  
  
 The OpenMP `reduction` clause lets you specify one or more thread-private variables that are subject to a reduction operation at the end of the parallel region. OpenMP predefines a set of reduction operators. Each reduction variable must be a scalar (for example, `int`, `long`, and `float`). OpenMP also defines several restrictions on how reduction variables are used in a parallel region.  
  
 The Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) provides the [concurrency::combinable](../../parallel/concrt/reference/combinable-class.md) class, which provides reusable, thread-local storage that lets you perform fine-grained computations and then merge those computations into a final result. The `combinable` class is a template that acts on both scalar and complex types. To use the `combinable` class, perform sub-computations in the body of a parallel construct and then call the [concurrency::combinable::combine](reference/combinable-class.md#combine) or [concurrency::combinable::combine_each](reference/combinable-class.md#combine_each) method to produce the final result. The `combine` and `combine_each` methods each take a *combine function* that specifies how to combine each pair of elements. Therefore, the `combinable` class is not restricted to a fixed set of reduction operators.  
  
## Example  
 This example uses both OpenMP and the Concurrency Runtime to compute the sum of the first 35 Fibonacci numbers.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-openmp#7](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/convert-an-openmp-loop-that-uses-a-reduction-variable_1.cpp)]  
  
 This example produces the following output.  
  
```Output  
Using OpenMP...  
The sum of the first 35 Fibonacci numbers is 14930351.  
Using the Concurrency Runtime...  
The sum of the first 35 Fibonacci numbers is 14930351.  
```  
  
 For more information about the `combinable` class, see [Parallel Containers and Objects](../../parallel/concrt/parallel-containers-and-objects.md).  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `concrt-omp-fibonacci-reduction.cpp` and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  
  
 **cl.exe /EHsc /openmp concrt-omp-fibonacci-reduction.cpp**
