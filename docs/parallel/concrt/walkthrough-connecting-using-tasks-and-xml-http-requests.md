# Walkthrough: Connecting Using Tasks and XML HTTP Requests
This example shows how to use the [IXMLHTTPRequest2](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msxml6/nn-msxml6-ixmlhttprequest2) and [IXMLHTTPRequest2Callback](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msxml6/nn-msxml6-ixmlhttprequest2callback) interfaces together with tasks to send HTTP GET and POST requests to a web service in a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. By combining `IXMLHTTPRequest2` together with tasks, you can write code that composes with other tasks. For example, you can use the download task as part of a chain of tasks. The download task can also respond when work is canceled.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  You can also use the C++ REST SDK to perform HTTP requests from a UWP app using C++ app or from a desktop C++ app. For more info, see [C++ REST SDK (Codename "Casablanca")](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk).  
  
 For more information about tasks, see [Task Parallelism](../../parallel/concrt/task-parallelism-concurrency-runtime.md). For more information about how to use tasks in a UWP app, see [Asynchronous programming in C++](/windows/uwp/threading-async/asynchronous-programming-in-cpp-universal-windows-platform-apps) and [Creating Asynchronous Operations in C++ for UWP Apps](../../parallel/concrt/creating-asynchronous-operations-in-cpp-for-windows-store-apps.md).  
  
 This document first shows how to create `HttpRequest` and its supporting classes. It then shows how to use this class from a UWP app that uses C++ and XAML.  
  
For an example that uses `IXMLHTTPRequest2` but does not use tasks, see [Quickstart: Connecting using XML HTTP Request (IXMLHTTPRequest2)](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh770550\(v=win.10\)).  
  
> [!TIP]
>  `IXMLHTTPRequest2` and `IXMLHTTPRequest2Callback` are the interfaces that we recommend for use in a UWP app. You can also adapt this example for use in a desktop app.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
## Defining the HttpRequest, HttpRequestBuffersCallback, and HttpRequestStringCallback Classes  
 When you use the `IXMLHTTPRequest2` interface to create web requests over HTTP, you implement the `IXMLHTTPRequest2Callback` interface to receive the server response and react to other events. This example defines the `HttpRequest` class to create web requests, and the `HttpRequestBuffersCallback` and `HttpRequestStringCallback` classes to process responses. The `HttpRequestBuffersCallback` and `HttpRequestStringCallback` classes support the `HttpRequest` class; you work only with the `HttpRequest` class from application code.  
  
 The `GetAsync`, `PostAsync` methods of the `HttpRequest` class enable you to start HTTP GET and POST operations, respectively. These methods use the `HttpRequestStringCallback` class to read the server response as a string. The `SendAsync` and `ReadAsync` methods enable you to stream large content in chunks. These methods each return [concurrency::task](../../parallel/concrt/reference/task-class.md) to represent the operation. The `GetAsync` and `PostAsync` methods produce `task<std::wstring>` value, where the `wstring` part represents the serverâ€™s response. The `SendAsync` and `ReadAsync` methods produce `task<void>` values; these tasks complete when the send and read operations complete.  
  
 Because the `IXMLHTTPRequest2` interfaces act asynchronously, this example uses [concurrency::task_completion_event](../../parallel/concrt/reference/task-completion-event-class.md) to create a task that completes after the callback object completes or cancels the download operation. The `HttpRequest` class creates a task-based continuation from this task to set the final result. The `HttpRequest` class uses a task-based continuation to ensure that the continuation task runs even if the previous task produces an error or is canceled. For more information about task-based continuations, see [Task Parallelism](../../parallel/concrt/task-parallelism-concurrency-runtime.md)  
  
 To support cancellation, the `HttpRequest`, `HttpRequestBuffersCallback`, and `HttpRequestStringCallback` classes use cancellation tokens. The `HttpRequestBuffersCallback` and `HttpRequestStringCallback` classes use the [concurrency::cancellation_token::register_callback](reference/cancellation-token-class.md#register_callback) method to enable the task completion event to respond to cancellation. This cancellation callback aborts the download. For more info about cancellation, see [Cancellation](../../parallel/concrt/exception-handling-in-the-concurrency-runtime.md#cancellation).  
  
#### To Define the HttpRequest Class  
  
1.  Use the Visual C++ **Blank App (XAML)** template to create a blank XAML app project. This example names the project `UsingIXMLHTTPRequest2`.  
  
2.  Add to the project a header file that is named HttpRequest.h and a source file that is named HttpRequest.cpp.  
  
3.  In pch.h, add this code:  
  
     [!code-cpp[concrt-using-ixhr2#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests_1.h)]  
  
4.  In HttpRequest.h, add this code:  
  
     [!code-cpp[concrt-using-ixhr2#2](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests_2.h)]  
  
5.  In HttpRequest.cpp, add this code:  
  
     [!code-cpp[concrt-using-ixhr2#3](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests_3.cpp)]  
  
## Using the HttpRequest Class in a UWP App  
 This section demonstrates how to use the `HttpRequest` class in a UWP app. The app provides an input box that defines a URL resource, and button commands that perform GET and POST operations, and a button command that cancels the current operation.  
  
#### To Use the HttpRequest Class  
  
1.  In MainPage.xaml, define the [StackPanel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.stackpanel.aspx) element as follows.  
  
     [!code-xml[concrt-using-ixhr2#A1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/xaml/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests_4.xaml)]  
  
2.  In MainPage.xaml.h, add this `#include` directive:  
  
     [!code-cpp[concrt-using-ixhr2#A2](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests_5.h)]  
  
3.  In MainPage.xaml.h, add these `private` member variables to the `MainPage` class:  
  
     [!code-cpp[concrt-using-ixhr2#A3](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests_6.h)]  
  
4.  In MainPage.xaml.h, declare the `private` method `ProcessHttpRequest`:  
  
     [!code-cpp[concrt-using-ixhr2#A4](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests_7.h)]  
  
5.  In MainPage.xaml.cpp, add these `using` statements:  
  
     [!code-cpp[concrt-using-ixhr2#A5](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests_8.cpp)]  
  
6.  In MainPage.xaml.cpp, implement the `GetButton_Click`, `PostButton_Click`, and `CancelButton_Click` methods of the `MainPage` class.  
  
     [!code-cpp[concrt-using-ixhr2#A6](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests_9.cpp)]  
  
    > [!TIP]


    >  If your app does not require support for cancellation, pass [concurrency::cancellation_token::none](reference/cancellation-token-class.md#none) to the `HttpRequest::GetAsync` and `HttpRequest::PostAsync` methods.  


  
7.  In MainPage.xaml.cpp, implement the `MainPage::ProcessHttpRequest` method.  
  
     [!code-cpp[concrt-using-ixhr2#A7](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests_10.cpp)]  
  
8.  In the project properties, under **Linker**, **Input**, specify `shcore.lib` and `msxml6.lib`.  
  
 Here is the running app:
