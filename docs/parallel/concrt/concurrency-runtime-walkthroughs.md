# Concurrency Runtime Walkthroughs

The scenario-based topics in this section show how to use many of the features of the Concurrency Runtime.

## In This Section

[Walkthrough: Connecting Using Tasks and XML HTTP Requests](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests.md)<br/>
Shows how to use the [IXMLHTTPRequest2](/windows/win32/api/msxml6/nn-msxml6-ixmlhttprequest2) and [IXMLHTTPRequest2Callback](/windows/win32/api/msxml6/nn-msxml6-ixmlhttprequest2callback) interfaces together with tasks to send HTTP GET and POST requests to a web service in a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app.

[Walkthrough: Creating an Agent-Based Application](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-creating-an-agent-based-application.md)<br/>
Describes how to create a basic agent-based application.

[Walkthrough: Creating a Dataflow Agent](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-creating-a-dataflow-agent.md)<br/>
Demonstrates how to create agent-based applications that are based on dataflow, instead of on control flow.

[Walkthrough: Creating an Image-Processing Network](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-creating-an-image-processing-network.md)<br/>
Demonstrates how to create a network of asynchronous message blocks that perform image processing.

[Walkthrough: Implementing Futures](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-implementing-futures.md)<br/>
Shows how to asynchronously compute values for later use.

[Walkthrough: Using join to Prevent Deadlock](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-using-join-to-prevent-deadlock.md)<br/>
Uses the dining philosophers problem to illustrate how to use the [concurrency::join](../../parallel/concrt/reference/join-class.md) class to prevent deadlock in your application.

[Walkthrough: Removing Work from a User-Interface Thread](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-removing-work-from-a-user-interface-thread.md)<br/>
Demonstrates how to improve the performance of an MFC application that draws the Mandelbrot fractal.

[Walkthrough: Using the Concurrency Runtime in a COM-Enabled Application](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-using-the-concurrency-runtime-in-a-com-enabled-application.md)<br/>
Demonstrates how to use the Concurrency Runtime in an application that uses the Component Object Model (COM).

[Walkthrough: Adapting Existing Code to Use Lightweight Tasks](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks.md)<br/>
Shows how to adapt existing code that uses the Windows API to create and execute a thread to use a lightweight task.

[Walkthrough: Creating a Custom Message Block](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-creating-a-custom-message-block.md)<br/>
Describes how to create a custom message block type that orders incoming messages by priority.
