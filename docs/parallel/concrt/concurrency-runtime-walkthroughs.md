# Concurrency Runtime Walkthroughs
The scenario-based topics in this section show how to use many of the features of the Concurrency Runtime.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Walkthrough: Connecting Using Tasks and XML HTTP Requests](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-connecting-using-tasks-and-xml-http-requests.md)  
 Shows how to use the [IXMLHTTPRequest2](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msxml6/nn-msxml6-ixmlhttprequest2) and [IXMLHTTPRequest2Callback](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/msxml6/nn-msxml6-ixmlhttprequest2callback) interfaces together with tasks to send HTTP GET and POST requests to a web service in a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Creating an Agent-Based Application](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-creating-an-agent-based-application.md)  
 Describes how to create a basic agent-based application.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Creating a Dataflow Agent](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-creating-a-dataflow-agent.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create agent-based applications that are based on dataflow, instead of on control flow.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Creating an Image-Processing Network](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-creating-an-image-processing-network.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a network of asynchronous message blocks that perform image processing.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Implementing Futures](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-implementing-futures.md)  
 Shows how to asynchronously compute values for later use.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Using join to Prevent Deadlock](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-using-join-to-prevent-deadlock.md)  
 Uses the dining philosophers problem to illustrate how to use the [concurrency::join](../../parallel/concrt/reference/join-class.md) class to prevent deadlock in your application.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Removing Work from a User-Interface Thread](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-removing-work-from-a-user-interface-thread.md)  
 Demonstrates how to improve the performance of an MFC application that draws the Mandelbrot fractal.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Using the Concurrency Runtime in a COM-Enabled Application](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-using-the-concurrency-runtime-in-a-com-enabled-application.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the Concurrency Runtime in an application that uses the Component Object Model (COM).  
  
 [Walkthrough: Adapting Existing Code to Use Lightweight Tasks](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-adapting-existing-code-to-use-lightweight-tasks.md)  
 Shows how to adapt existing code that uses the Windows API to create and execute a thread to use a lightweight task.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Creating a Custom Message Block](../../parallel/concrt/walkthrough-creating-a-custom-message-block.md)  
 Describes how to create a custom message block type that orders incoming messages by priority.
