# How to: Provide Work Functions to the call and transformer Classes
This topic illustrates several ways to provide work functions to the [concurrency::call](../../parallel/concrt/reference/call-class.md) and [concurrency::transformer](../../parallel/concrt/reference/transformer-class.md) classes.  
  
 The first example shows how to pass a lambda expression to a `call` object. The second example shows how to pass a function object to a `call` object. The third example shows how to bind a class method to a `call` object.  
  
 For illustration, every example in this topic uses the `call` class. For an example that uses the `transformer` class, see [How to: Use transformer in a Data Pipeline](../../parallel/concrt/how-to-use-transformer-in-a-data-pipeline.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a common way to use the `call` class. This example passes a lambda function to the `call` constructor.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-call-lambda#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/how-to-provide-work-functions-to-the-call-and-transformer-classes_1.cpp)]  
  
 This example produces the following output.  
  
```Output  
13 squared is 169.  
```  
  
## Example  
 The following example resembles the previous one, except that it uses the `call` class together with a function object (functor).  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-call-functor#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/how-to-provide-work-functions-to-the-call-and-transformer-classes_2.cpp)]  
  
## Example  

 The following example resembles the previous one, except that it uses the [std::bind1st](../../standard-library/functional-functions.md#bind1st) and [std::mem_fun](../../standard-library/functional-functions.md#mem_fun) functions to bind a `call` object to a class method.  

  
 Use this technique if you have to bind a `call` or `transformer` object to a specific class method instead of the function call operator, `operator()`.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-call-method#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/how-to-provide-work-functions-to-the-call-and-transformer-classes_3.cpp)]  
  
 You can also assign the result of the `bind1st` function to a [std::function](../../standard-library/function-class.md) object or use the `auto` keyword, as shown in the following example.  
  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-call-method#2](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/how-to-provide-work-functions-to-the-call-and-transformer-classes_4.cpp)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `call.cpp` and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  
  
 **cl.exe /EHsc call.cpp**
