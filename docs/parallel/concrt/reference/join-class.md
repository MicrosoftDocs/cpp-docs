# join Class
A `join` messaging block is a single-target, multi-source, ordered `propagator_block` which combines together messages of type `T` from each of its sources.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
template<class T,
    join_type _Jtype = non_greedy>
class join : public propagator_block<single_link_registry<ITarget<std::vector<T>>>,
    multi_link_registry<ISource<T>>>;
```   
  
#### Parameters  
 `T`  
 The payload type of the messages joined and propagated by the block.  
  
 `_Jtype`  
 The kind of `join` block this is, either `greedy` or `non_greedy`  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[join](#ctor)|Overloaded. Constructs a `join` messaging block.|  
|[~join Destructor](#dtor)|Destroys the `join` block.|  
  
### Protected Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[accept_message](#accept_message)|Accepts a message that was offered by this `join` messaging block, transferring ownership to the caller.|  
|[consume_message](#consume_message)|Consumes a message previously offered by the `join` messaging block and reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.|  
|[link_target_notification](#link_target_notification)|A callback that notifies that a new target has been linked to this `join` messaging block.|  
|[propagate_message](#propagate_message)|Asynchronously passes a message from an `ISource` block to this `join` messaging block. It is invoked by the `propagate` method, when called by a source block.|  
|[propagate_to_any_targets](#propagate_to_any_targets)|Constructs an output message containing an input message from each source when they have all propagated a message. Sends this output message out to each of its targets.|  
|[release_message](#release_message)|Releases a previous message reservation. (Overrides [source_block::release_message](source-block-class.md#release_message).)|  
|[reserve_message](#reserve_message)|Reserves a message previously offered by this `join` messaging block. (Overrides [source_block::reserve_message](source-block-class.md#reserve_message).)|  
|[resume_propagation](#resume_propagation)|Resumes propagation after a reservation has been released. (Overrides [source_block::resume_propagation](source-block-class.md#resume_propagation).)|

 `join`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="accept_message"></a> accept_message 

 Accepts a message that was offered by this `join` messaging block, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```
virtual message<_OutputType>* accept_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the offered `message` object.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
##  <a name="consume_message"></a> consume_message 

 Consumes a message previously offered by the `join` messaging block and reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```
virtual message<_OutputType>* consume_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being consumed.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 Similar to `accept`, but is always preceded by a call to `reserve`.  
  
##  <a name="ctor"></a> join 

 Constructs a `join` messaging block.  
  
```
join(
    size_t _NumInputs);

join(
    size_t _NumInputs,
    filter_method const& _Filter);

join(
    Scheduler& _PScheduler,
    size_t _NumInputs);

join(
    Scheduler& _PScheduler,
    size_t _NumInputs,
    filter_method const& _Filter);

join(
    ScheduleGroup& _PScheduleGroup,
    size_t _NumInputs);

join(
    ScheduleGroup& _PScheduleGroup,
    size_t _NumInputs,
    filter_method const& _Filter);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_NumInputs`  
 The number of inputs this `join` block will be allowed.  
  
 `_Filter`  
 A filter function which determines whether offered messages should be accepted.  
  
 `_PScheduler`  
 The `Scheduler` object within which the propagation task for the `join` messaging block is scheduled.  
  
 `_PScheduleGroup`  
 The `ScheduleGroup` object within which the propagation task for the `join` messaging block is scheduled. The `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  
  
### Remarks  
 The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the `_PScheduler` or `_PScheduleGroup` parameters.  
  
 The type `filter_method` is a functor with signature `bool (T const &)` which is invoked by this `join` messaging block to determine whether or not it should accept an offered message.  
  
##  <a name="dtor"></a> ~join 

 Destroys the `join` block.  
  
```
~join();
```  
  
##  <a name="link_target_notification"></a> link_target_notification 

 A callback that notifies that a new target has been linked to this `join` messaging block.  
  
```
virtual void link_target_notification(_Inout_ ITarget<std::vector<T>> *);
```  
  
##  <a name="propagate_message"></a> propagate_message 

 Asynchronously passes a message from an `ISource` block to this `join` messaging block. It is invoked by the `propagate` method, when called by a source block.  
  
```
message_status propagate_message(
    _Inout_ message<T>* _PMessage,
    _Inout_ ISource<T>* _PSource);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PMessage`  
 A pointer to the `message` object.  
  
 `_PSource`  
 A pointer to the source block offering the message.  
  
### Return Value  
 A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  
  
##  <a name="propagate_to_any_targets"></a> propagate_to_any_targets 

 Constructs an output message containing an input message from each source when they have all propagated a message. Sends this output message out to each of its targets.  
  
```
void propagate_to_any_targets(_Inout_opt_ message<_OutputType> *);
```  
  
##  <a name="release_message"></a> release_message 

 Releases a previous message reservation.  
  
```
virtual void release_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being released.  
  
##  <a name="reserve_message"></a> reserve_message 

 Reserves a message previously offered by this `join` messaging block.  
  
```
virtual bool reserve_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the offered `message` object.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise.  
  
### Remarks  
 After `reserve` is called, if it returns `true`, either `consume` or `release` must be called to either take or release ownership of the message.  
  
##  <a name="resume_propagation"></a> resume_propagation 

 Resumes propagation after a reservation has been released.  
  
```
virtual void resume_propagation();
```
