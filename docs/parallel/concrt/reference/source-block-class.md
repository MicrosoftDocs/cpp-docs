# source_block Class
The `source_block` class is an abstract base class for source-only blocks. The class provides basic link management functionality as well as common error checks.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
template<class _TargetLinkRegistry, class _MessageProcessorType = ordered_message_processor<typename _TargetLinkRegistry::type::type>>
class source_block : public ISource<typename _TargetLinkRegistry::type::type>;
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `_TargetLinkRegistry`  
 Link registry to be used for holding the target links.  
  
 `_MessageProcessorType`  
 Processor type for message processing.

## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 [ISource](isource-class.md)  
  
 `source_block`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="accept"></a> accept 

 Accepts a message that was offered by this `source_block` object, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```
virtual message<_Target_type>* accept(
    runtime_object_identity _MsgId,
    _Inout_ ITarget<_Target_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the offered `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the `accept` method.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 The method throws an [invalid_argument](../../../standard-library/invalid-argument-class.md) exception if the parameter `_PTarget` is `NULL`.  
  
 The `accept` method is called by a target while a message is being offered by this `ISource` block. The message pointer returned may be different from the one passed into the `propagate` method of the `ITarget` block, if this source decides to make a copy of the message.  
  
##  <a name="accept_message"></a> accept_message 

 When overridden in a derived class, accepts an offered message by the source. Message blocks should override this method to validate the `_MsgId` and return a message.  
  
```
virtual message<_Target_type>* accept_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId) = 0;
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The runtime object identity of the `message` object.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the message that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 To transfer ownership, the original message pointer should be returned. To maintain ownership, a copy of message payload needs to be made and returned.  
  
##  <a name="acquire_ref"></a> acquire_ref 

 Acquires a reference count on this `source_block` object, to prevent deletion.  
  
```
virtual void acquire_ref(_Inout_ ITarget<_Target_type> *);
```  
  
### Remarks  
 This method is called by an `ITarget` object that is being linked to this source during the `link_target` method.  
  
##  <a name="async_send"></a> async_send 

 Asynchronously queues up messages and starts a propagation task, if this has not been done already  
  
```
virtual void async_send(_Inout_opt_ message<_Target_type>* _Msg);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Msg`  
 A pointer to a `message` object to asynchronously send.  
  
##  <a name="consume"></a> consume 

 Consumes a message previously offered by this `source_block` object and successfully reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```
virtual message<_Target_type>* consume(
    runtime_object_identity _MsgId,
    _Inout_ ITarget<_Target_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the reserved `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the `consume` method.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 The method throws an [invalid_argument](../../../standard-library/invalid-argument-class.md) exception if the parameter `_PTarget` is `NULL`.  
  
 The method throws a [bad_target](bad-target-class.md) exception if the parameter `_PTarget` does not represent the target that called `reserve`.  
  
 The `consume` method is similar to `accept`, but must always be preceded by a call to `reserve` that returned `true`.  
  
##  <a name="consume_message"></a> consume_message 

 When overridden in a derived class, consumes a message that was previously reserved.  
  
```
virtual message<_Target_type>* consume_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId) = 0;
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being consumed.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the message that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 Similar to `accept`, but is always preceded by a call to `reserve`.  
  
##  <a name="enable_batched_processing"></a> enable_batched_processing 

 Enables batched processing for this block.  
  
```
void enable_batched_processing();
```  
  
##  <a name="initialize_source"></a> initialize_source

    _Inout_opt_ Scheduler* _PScheduler = NULL,
    _Inout_opt_ ScheduleGroup* _PScheduleGroup = NULL);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PScheduler`  
 The scheduler to be used for scheduling tasks.

##  <a name="propagate_to_any_targets"></a> propagate_to_any_targets 

 When overridden in a derived class, propagates the given message to any or all of the linked targets. This is the main propagation routine for message blocks.  
  
```
virtual void propagate_to_any_targets(_Inout_opt_ message<_Target_type>* _PMessage);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PMessage`  
 A pointer to the message that is to be propagated.

 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the `release` method.  
  
### Remarks  
 The method throws an [invalid_argument](../../../standard-library/invalid-argument-class.md) exception if the parameter `_PTarget` is `NULL`.  
  
 The method throws a [bad_target](bad-target-class.md) exception if the parameter `_PTarget` does not represent the target that called `reserve`.  
  
##  <a name="release_message"></a> release_message 

 When overridden in a derived class, releases a previous message reservation.  
  
```
virtual void release_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId) = 0;
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being released.  
  
##  <a name="release_ref"></a> release_ref 

 Releases a reference count on this `source_block` object.  
  
```
virtual void release_ref(_Inout_ ITarget<_Target_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling this method.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method is called by an `ITarget` object that is being unlinked from this source. The source block is allowed to release any resources reserved for the target block.  
  
##  <a name="remove_targets"></a> remove_targets 

 Removes all target links for this source block. This should be called from the destructor.  
  
```
void remove_targets();
```  
  
##  <a name="reserve"></a> reserve 

 Reserves a message previously offered by this `source_block` object.

```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the offered `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the `reserve` method.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise. Reservations can fail for many reasons, including: the message was already reserved or accepted by another target, the source could deny reservations, and so forth.  
  
### Remarks  
 The method throws an [invalid_argument](../../../standard-library/invalid-argument-class.md) exception if the parameter `_PTarget` is `NULL`.  
  
 After you call `reserve`, if it succeeds, you must call either `consume` or `release` in order to take or give up possession of the message, respectively.  
  
##  <a name="reserve_message"></a> reserve_message 

 When overridden in a derived class, reserves a message previously offered by this `source_block` object.

 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being reserved.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise.  
  
### Remarks  
 After `reserve` is called, if it returns `true`, either `consume` or `release` must be called to either take or release ownership of the message.  
  
##  <a name="resume_propagation"></a> resume_propagation 

 When overridden in a derived class, resumes propagation after a reservation has been released.  
  
```
virtual void resume_propagation() = 0;
