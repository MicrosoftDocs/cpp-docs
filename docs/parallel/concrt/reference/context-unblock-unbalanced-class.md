# context_unblock_unbalanced Class
This class describes an exception thrown when calls to the `Block` and `Unblock` methods of a `Context` object are not properly paired.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class context_unblock_unbalanced : public std::exception;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[context_unblock_unbalanced](#ctor)|Overloaded. Constructs a `context_unblock_unbalanced` object.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Calls to the `Block` and `Unblock` methods of a `Context` object must always be properly paired. The Concurrency Runtime allows the operations to happen in either order. For example, a call to `Block` can be followed by a call to `Unblock`, or vice-versa. This exception would be thrown if, for instance, two calls to the `Unblock` method were made in a row, on a `Context` object which was not blocked.
