# timer Class
A `timer` messaging block is a single-target `source_block` capable of sending a message to its target after a specified time period has elapsed or at specific intervals.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
template<class T>
class timer : public Concurrency::details::_Timer, public source_block<single_link_registry<ITarget<T>>>;
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `T`  
 The payload type of the output messages of this block.  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[timer](#ctor)|Overloaded. Constructs a `timer` messaging block that will fire a given message after a specified interval.|  
|[~timer Destructor](#dtor)|Destroys a `timer` messaging block.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[pause](#pause)|Stops the `timer` messaging block. If it is a repeating `timer` messaging block, it can be restarted with a subsequent `start()` call. For non-repeating timers, this has the same effect as a `stop` call.|  
|[start](#start)|Starts the `timer` messaging block. The specified number of milliseconds after this is called, the specified value will be propagated downstream as a `message`.|  
|[stop](#stop)|Stops the `timer` messaging block.|  
  
### Protected Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[accept_message](#accept_message)|Accepts a message that was offered by this `timer` messaging block, transferring ownership to the caller.|  
|[consume_message](#consume_message)|Consumes a message previously offered by the `timer` and reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.|  
|[link_target_notification](#link_target_notification)|A callback that notifies that a new target has been linked to this `timer` messaging block.|  
|[propagate_to_any_targets](#propagate_to_any_targets)|Tries to offer the message produced by the `timer` block to all of the linked targets.|  
|[release_message](#release_message)|Releases a previous message reservation. (Overrides [source_block::release_message](source-block-class.md#release_message).)|  
|[reserve_message](#reserve_message)|Reserves a message previously offered by this `timer` messaging block. (Overrides [source_block::reserve_message](source-block-class.md#reserve_message).)|  
|[resume_propagation](#resume_propagation)|Resumes propagation after a reservation has been released. (Overrides [source_block::resume_propagation](source-block-class.md#resume_propagation).)|

## Inheritance Hierarchy

 `timer`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="accept_message"></a> accept_message 

 Accepts a message that was offered by this `timer` messaging block, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```
virtual message<T>* accept_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the offered `message` object.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
##  <a name="consume_message"></a> consume_message 

 Consumes a message previously offered by the `timer` and reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```
virtual message<T>* consume_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being consumed.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 Similar to `accept`, but is always preceded by a call to `reserve`.  
  
##  <a name="link_target_notification"></a> link_target_notification 

 A callback that notifies that a new target has been linked to this `timer` messaging block.  
  
```
virtual void link_target_notification(_Inout_ ITarget<T>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the newly linked target.  
  
##  <a name="pause"></a> pause 

 Stops the `timer` messaging block. If it is a repeating `timer` messaging block, it can be restarted with a subsequent `start()` call. For non-repeating timers, this has the same effect as a `stop` call.  
  
```
void pause();
```  
  
##  <a name="propagate_to_any_targets"></a> propagate_to_any_targets 

 Tries to offer the message produced by the `timer` block to all of the linked targets.  
  
```
virtual void propagate_to_any_targets(_Inout_opt_ message<T> *);
```  
  
##  <a name="release_message"></a> release_message 

 Releases a previous message reservation.  
  
```
virtual void release_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being released.  
  
##  <a name="reserve_message"></a> reserve_message 

 Reserves a message previously offered by this `timer` messaging block.  
  
```
virtual bool reserve_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being reserved.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise.  
  
### Remarks  
 After `reserve` is called, if it returns `true`, either `consume` or `release` must be called to either take or release ownership of the message.  
  
##  <a name="resume_propagation"></a> resume_propagation 

 Resumes propagation after a reservation has been released.  
  
```
virtual void resume_propagation();
```  
  
##  <a name="start"></a> start 

 Starts the `timer` messaging block. The specified number of milliseconds after this is called, the specified value will be propagated downstream as a `message`.  
  
```
void start();
```  
  
##  <a name="stop"></a> stop 

 Stops the `timer` messaging block.  
  
```
void stop();
```  
  
##  <a name="ctor"></a> timer 

 Constructs a `timer` messaging block that will fire a given message after a specified interval.  
  
```
timer(
    unsigned int _Ms,
    T const& value,
    ITarget<T>* _PTarget = NULL,
    bool _Repeating = false);

timer(
    Scheduler& _Scheduler,
    unsigned int _Ms,
    T const& value,
    _Inout_opt_ ITarget<T>* _PTarget = NULL,
    bool _Repeating = false);

timer(
    ScheduleGroup& _ScheduleGroup,
    unsigned int _Ms,
    T const& value,
    _Inout_opt_ ITarget<T>* _PTarget = NULL,
    bool _Repeating = false);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Ms`  
 The number of milliseconds that must elapse after the call to start for the specified message to be propagated downstream.  
  
 `value`  
 The value which will be propagated downstream when the timer elapses.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 The target to which the timer will propagate its message.  
  
 `_Repeating`  
 If true, indicates that the timer will fire periodically every `_Ms` milliseconds.  
  
 `_Scheduler`  
 The `Scheduler` object within which the propagation task for the `timer` messaging block is scheduled is scheduled.  
  
 `_ScheduleGroup`  
 The `ScheduleGroup` object within which the propagation task for the `timer` messaging block is scheduled. The `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  
  
### Remarks  
 The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the `_Scheduler` or `_ScheduleGroup` parameters.  
  
##  <a name="dtor"></a> ~timer 

 Destroys a `timer` messaging block.  
  
```
~timer();
```
