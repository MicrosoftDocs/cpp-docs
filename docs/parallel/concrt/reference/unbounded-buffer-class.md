An `unbounded_buffer` messaging block is a multi-target, multi-source, ordered `propagator_block` capable of storing an unbounded number of messages.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template<  
   class             _Type  
>  
class unbounded_buffer : public propagator_block<multi_link_registry<ITarget<            _Type>>, multi_link_registry<ISource<            _Type>>>;  
```  
  
#### Parameters

 `unbounded_buffer`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="accept_message"></a> accept_message 

 Accepts a message that was offered by this `unbounded_buffer` messaging block, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```  
virtual message<_Type> * accept_message(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the offered `message` object.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
##  <a name="consume_message"></a> consume_message 

 Consumes a message previously offered by the `unbounded_buffer` messaging block and reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```  
virtual message<_Type> * consume_message(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being consumed.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 Similar to `accept`, but is always preceded by a call to `reserve`.  
  
##  <a name="dequeue"></a> dequeue 

 Removes an item from the `unbounded_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```  
_Type dequeue();  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The payload of the message removed from the `unbounded_buffer`.  
  
##  <a name="enqueue"></a> enqueue 

 Adds an item to the `unbounded_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```  
bool enqueue(  
   _Type const&                 _Item  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Item`  
 The item to add.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the item was accepted, `false` otherwise.  
  
##  <a name="link_target_notification"></a> link_target_notification 

 A callback that notifies that a new target has been linked to this `unbounded_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual void link_target_notification(  
   _Inout_ ITarget<_Type> *                 _PTarget  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the newly linked target.  
  
##  <a name="propagate_message"></a> propagate_message 

 Asynchronously passes a message from an `ISource` block to this `unbounded_buffer` messaging block. It is invoked by the `propagate` method, when called by a source block.  
  
```  
virtual message_status propagate_message(  
   _Inout_ message<_Type> *                 _PMessage,  
   _Inout_ ISource<_Type> *                 _PSource  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PMessage`  
 A pointer to the `message` object.  
  
 `_PSource`  
 A pointer to the source block offering the message.  
  
### Return Value  
 A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md#message_status) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  
  
##  <a name="propagate_output_messages"></a> propagate_output_messages 

 Places the `message` `_PMessage` in this `unbounded_buffer` messaging block and tries to offer it to all of the linked targets.  
  
```  
virtual void propagate_output_messages();  
```  
  
### Remarks  
 If another message is already ahead of this one in the `unbounded_buffer`, propagation to linked targets will not occur until any earlier messages have been accepted or consumed. The first linked target to successfully `accept` or `consume` the message takes ownership, and no other target can then get the message.  
  
##  <a name="process_input_messages"></a> process_input_messages 

 Places the `message` `_PMessage` in this `unbounded_buffer` messaging block and tries to offer it to all of the linked targets.  
  
```  
virtual void process_input_messages(  
   _Inout_ message<_Type> *                 _PMessage  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PMessage`  
  
##  <a name="release_message"></a> release_message 

 Releases a previous message reservation.  
  
```  
virtual void release_message(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being released.  
  
##  <a name="reserve_message"></a> reserve_message 

 Reserves a message previously offered by this `unbounded_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual bool reserve_message(  
   runtime_object_identity                 _MsgId  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being reserved.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise.  
  
### Remarks  
 After `reserve` is called, if it returns `true`, either `consume` or `release` must be called to either take or release ownership of the message.  
  
##  <a name="resume_propagation"></a> resume_propagation 

 Resumes propagation after a reservation has been released.  
  
```  
virtual void resume_propagation();  
```  
  
##  <a name="send_message"></a> send_message 

 Synchronously passes a message from an `ISource` block to this `unbounded_buffer` messaging block. It is invoked by the `send` method, when called by a source block.  
  
```  
virtual message_status send_message(  
   _Inout_ message<_Type> *                 _PMessage,  
   _Inout_ ISource<_Type> *                 _PSource  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PMessage`  
 A pointer to the `message` object.  
  
 `_PSource`  
 A pointer to the source block offering the message.  
  
### Return Value  
 A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md#message_status) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  
  
##  <a name="supports_anonymous_source"></a> supports_anonymous_source 

 Overrides the `supports_anonymous_source` method to indicate that this block can accept messages offered to it by a source that is not linked.  
  
```  
virtual bool supports_anonymous_source();  
```  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` because the block does not postpone offered messages.  
  
##  <a name="ctor"></a> unbounded_buffer 

 Constructs an `unbounded_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```  
unbounded_buffer();  
  
unbounded_buffer(  
   filter_method const&                 _Filter  
);  
  
unbounded_buffer(  
   Scheduler&                 _PScheduler  
);  
  
unbounded_buffer(  
   Scheduler&                 _PScheduler,  
   filter_method const&                 _Filter  
);  
  
unbounded_buffer(  
   ScheduleGroup&                 _PScheduleGroup  
);  
  
unbounded_buffer(  
   ScheduleGroup&                 _PScheduleGroup,  
   filter_method const&                 _Filter  
);  
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Filter`  
 A filter function which determines whether offered messages should be accepted.  
  
 `_PScheduler`  
 The `Scheduler` object within which the propagation task for the `unbounded_buffer` messaging block is scheduled.  
  
 `_PScheduleGroup`  
 The `ScheduleGroup` object within which the propagation task for the `unbounded_buffer` messaging block is scheduled. The `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  
  
### Remarks  
 The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the `_PScheduler` or `_PScheduleGroup` parameters.  
  
 The type `filter_method` is a functor with signature `bool (_Type const &)` which is invoked by this `unbounded_buffer` messaging block to determine whether or not it should accept an offered message.  
  
##  <a name="dtor"></a> ~unbounded_buffer 

 Destroys the `unbounded_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```  
~unbounded_buffer();  
```
