# affinity_partitioner Class
The `affinity_partitioner` class is similar to the `static_partitioner` class, but it improves cache affinity by its choice of mapping subranges to worker threads. It can improve performance significantly when a loop is re-executed over the same data set, and the data fits in cache. Note that the same `affinity_partitioner` object must be used with subsequent iterations of a parallel loop that is executed over a particular data set, to benefit from data locality.  
  
## Syntax
