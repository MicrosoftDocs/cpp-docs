# overwrite_buffer Class
An `overwrite_buffer` messaging block is a multi-target, multi-source, ordered `propagator_block` capable of storing a single message at a time. New messages overwrite previously held ones.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
template<class T>
class overwrite_buffer : public propagator_block<multi_link_registry<ITarget<T>>, multi_link_registry<ISource<T>>>;
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `T`  
 The payload type of the messages stored and propagated by the buffer.  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Constructors

|----------|-----------------|  
|[overwrite_buffer](#ctor)|Overloaded. Constructs an `overwrite_buffer` messaging block.|  
|[~overwrite_buffer Destructor](#dtor)|Destroys the `overwrite_buffer` messaging block.|

## Remarks  
 An `overwrite_buffer` messaging block propagates out copies of its stored message to each of its targets.

 `overwrite_buffer`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="accept_message"></a> accept_message 

 Accepts a message that was offered by this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block, returning a copy of the message to the caller.  
  
```
virtual message<T>* accept_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the offered `message` object.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 The `overwrite_buffer` messaging block returns copies of the message to its targets, rather than transferring ownership of the currently held message.  
  
##  <a name="consume_message"></a> consume_message 

 Consumes a message previously offered by the `overwrite_buffer` messaging block and reserved by the target, returning a copy of the message to the caller.  
  
```
virtual message<T>* consume_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being consumed.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 Similar to `accept`, but is always preceded by a call to `reserve`.  
  
##  <a name="has_value"></a> has_value 

 Checks whether this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block has a value yet.  
  
```
bool has_value() const;
```  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the block has received a value, `false` otherwise.  
  
##  <a name="link_target_notification"></a> link_target_notification 

 A callback that notifies that a new target has been linked to this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```
virtual void link_target_notification(_Inout_ ITarget<T>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the newly linked target.  
  
##  <a name="dtor"></a> ~overwrite_buffer 

 Destroys the `overwrite_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```
~overwrite_buffer();
```  
  
##  <a name="ctor"></a> overwrite_buffer 

 Constructs an `overwrite_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```
overwrite_buffer();

overwrite_buffer(
    filter_method const& _Filter);

overwrite_buffer(
    Scheduler& _PScheduler);

overwrite_buffer(
    Scheduler& _PScheduler,
    filter_method const& _Filter);

overwrite_buffer(
    ScheduleGroup& _PScheduleGroup);

overwrite_buffer(
    ScheduleGroup& _PScheduleGroup,
    filter_method const& _Filter);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Filter`  
 A filter function which determines whether offered messages should be accepted.  
  
 `_PScheduler`  
 The `Scheduler` object within which the propagation task for the `overwrite_buffer` messaging block is scheduled.  
  
 `_PScheduleGroup`  
 The `ScheduleGroup` object within which the propagation task for the `overwrite_buffer` messaging block is scheduled. The `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  
  
### Remarks  
 The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the `_PScheduler` or `_PScheduleGroup` parameters.  
  
 The type `filter_method` is a functor with signature `bool (T const &)` which is invoked by this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block to determine whether or not it should accept an offered message.  
  
##  <a name="propagate_message"></a> propagate_message 

 Asynchronously passes a message from an `ISource` block to this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block. It is invoked by the `propagate` method, when called by a source block.  
  
```
virtual message_status propagate_message(
    _Inout_ message<T>* _PMessage,
    _Inout_ ISource<T>* _PSource);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PMessage`  
 A pointer to the `message` object.  
  
 `_PSource`  
 A pointer to the source block offering the message.  
  
### Return Value  
 A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  
  
##  <a name="propagate_to_any_targets"></a> propagate_to_any_targets 

 Places the `message _PMessage` in this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block and offers it to all of the linked targets.  
  
```
virtual void propagate_to_any_targets(_Inout_ message<T>* _PMessage);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PMessage`  
 A pointer to a `message` object that this `overwrite_buffer` has taken ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method overwrites the current message in the `overwrite_buffer` with the newly accepted message `_PMessage`.  
  
##  <a name="send_message"></a> send_message 

 Synchronously passes a message from an `ISource` block to this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block. It is invoked by the `send` method, when called by a source block.  
  
```
virtual message_status send_message(
    _Inout_ message<T>* _PMessage,
    _Inout_ ISource<T>* _PSource);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PMessage`  
 A pointer to the `message` object.  
  
 `_PSource`  
 A pointer to the source block offering the message.  
  
### Return Value  
 A [message_status](concurrency-namespace-enums.md) indication of what the target decided to do with the message.  
  
##  <a name="supports_anonymous_source"></a> supports_anonymous_source 

 Overrides the `supports_anonymous_source` method to indicate that this block can accept messages offered to it by a source that is not linked.  
  
```
virtual bool supports_anonymous_source();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` because the block does not postpone offered messages.  
  
##  <a name="release_message"></a> release_message 

 Releases a previous message reservation.  
  
```
virtual void release_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being released.  
  
##  <a name="reserve_message"></a> reserve_message 

 Reserves a message previously offered by this `overwrite_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```
virtual bool reserve_message(runtime_object_identity _MsgId);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being reserved.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise.  
  
### Remarks  
 After `reserve` is called, if it returns `true`, either `consume` or `release` must be called to either take or release ownership of the message.  
  
##  <a name="resume_propagation"></a> resume_propagation 

 Resumes propagation after a reservation has been released.  
  
```
virtual void resume_propagation();
```  
  
##  <a name="value"></a> value 

 Gets a reference to the current payload of the message being stored in the `overwrite_buffer` messaging block.  
  
```
T value();
```  
  
### Return Value  
 The payload of the currently stored message.  
  
### Remarks  
 The value stored in the `overwrite_buffer` could change immediately after this method returns. This method will wait until a message arrives if no message is currently stored in the `overwrite_buffer`.
