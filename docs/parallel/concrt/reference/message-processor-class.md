# message_processor Class
The `message_processor` class is the abstract base class for processing of `message` objects. There is no guarantee on the ordering of the messages.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```
template<class T>
class message_processor;
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `T`  
 The data type of the payload within messages handled by this `message_processor` object.  
  
## Members  
  
### Public Typedefs  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`type`|A type alias for `T`.|  
  
### Public Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[async_send](#async_send)|When overridden in a derived class, places messages into the block asynchronously.|  
|[sync_send](#sync_send)|When overridden in a derived class, places messages into the block synchronously.|  
|[wait](#wait)|When overridden in a derived class, waits for all asynchronous operations to complete.|  
  
### Protected Methods  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[process_incoming_message](#process_incoming_message)|When overridden in a derived class, performs the forward processing of messages into the block. Called once every time a new message is added and the queue is found to be empty.|  
  
## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 `message_processor`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="async_send"></a> async_send 

 When overridden in a derived class, places messages into the block asynchronously.  
  
```
virtual void async_send(_Inout_opt_ message<T>* _Msg) = 0;
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Msg`  
 A `message` object to send asynchronously.  
  
### Remarks  
 Processor implementations should override this method.  
  
##  <a name="process_incoming_message"></a> process_incoming_message 

 When overridden in a derived class, performs the forward processing of messages into the block. Called once every time a new message is added and the queue is found to be empty.  
  
```
virtual void process_incoming_message() = 0;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Message block implementations should override this method.  
  
##  <a name="sync_send"></a> sync_send 

 When overridden in a derived class, places messages into the block synchronously.  
  
```
virtual void sync_send(_Inout_opt_ message<T>* _Msg) = 0;
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Msg`  
 A `message` object to send synchronously.  
  
### Remarks  
 Processor implementations should override this method.  
  
##  <a name="wait"></a> wait 

 When overridden in a derived class, waits for all asynchronous operations to complete.  
  
```
virtual void wait() = 0;
```  
  
### Remarks  
 Processor implementations should override this method.
