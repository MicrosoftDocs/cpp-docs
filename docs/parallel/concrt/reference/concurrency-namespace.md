# concurrency Namespace
The `Concurrency` namespace provides classes and functions that give you access to the Concurrency Runtime, a concurrent programming framework for C++. For more information, see [Concurrency Runtime](../../../parallel/concrt/concurrency-runtime.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
namespace concurrency;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
### Typedefs  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|`runtime_object_identity`|Each message instance has an identity that follows it as it is cloned and passed between messaging components. This cannot be the address of the message object.|  
|`task_status`|A type that represents the terminal state of a task. Valid values are `completed` and `canceled`.|  
|`TaskProc`|An elementary abstraction for a task, defined as `void (__cdecl * TaskProc)(void *)`. A `TaskProc` is called to invoke the body of a task.|  
|`TaskProc_t`|An elementary abstraction for a task, defined as `void (__cdecl * TaskProc_t)(void *)`. A `TaskProc` is called to invoke the body of a task.|  
  
### Classes  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|[affinity_partitioner Class](affinity-partitioner-class.md)|The `affinity_partitioner` class is similar to the `static_partitioner` class, but it improves cache affinity by its choice of mapping subranges to worker threads. It can improve performance significantly when a loop is re-executed over the same data set, and the data fits in cache. Note that the same `affinity_partitioner` object must be used with subsequent iterations of a parallel loop that is executed over a particular data set, to benefit from data locality.|  
|[agent Class](agent-class.md)|A class intended to be used as a base class for all independent agents. It is used to hide state from other agents and interact using message-passing.|  
|[auto_partitioner Class](auto-partitioner-class.md)|The `auto_partitioner` class represents the default method `parallel_for`, `parallel_for_each` and `parallel_transform` use to partition the range they iterates over. This method of partitioning employes range stealing for load balancing as well as per-iterate cancellation.|  
|[bad_target Class](bad-target-class.md)|This class describes an exception thrown when a messaging block is given a pointer to a target which is invalid for the operation being performed.|  
|[call Class](call-class.md)|A `call` messaging block is a multi-source, ordered `target_block` that invokes a specified function when receiving a message.|  
|[cancellation_token Class](cancellation-token-class.md)|The `cancellation_token` class represents the ability to determine whether some operation has been requested to cancel. A given token can be associated with a `task_group`, `structured_task_group`, or `task` to provide implicit cancellation. It can also be polled for cancellation or have a callback registered for if and when the associated `cancellation_token_source` is canceled.|  
|[cancellation_token_registration Class](cancellation-token-registration-class.md)|The `cancellation_token_registration` class represents a callback notification from a `cancellation_token`. When the `register` method on a `cancellation_token` is used to receive notification of when cancellation occurs, a `cancellation_token_registration` object is returned as a handle to the callback so that the caller can request a specific callback no longer be made through use of the `deregister` method.|  
|[cancellation_token_source Class](cancellation-token-source-class.md)|The `cancellation_token_source` class represents the ability to cancel some cancelable operation.|  
|[choice Class](choice-class.md)|A `choice` messaging block is a multi-source, single-target block that represents a control-flow interaction with a set of sources. The choice block will wait for any one of multiple sources to produce a message and will propagate the index of the source that produced the message.|  
|[combinable Class](combinable-class.md)|The `combinable<T>` object is intended to provide thread-private copies of data, to perform lock-free thread-local sub-computations during parallel algorithms. At the end of the parallel operation, the thread-private sub-computations can then be merged into a final result. This class can be used instead of a shared variable, and can result in a performance improvement if there would otherwise be a lot of contention on that shared variable.|

The sequence is represented in a way that enables concurrency-safe append, element access, iterator access, and iterator traversal operations.|  
|[concurrent_unordered_multimap Class](concurrent-unordered-multimap-class.md)|The `concurrent_unordered_multimap` class is an concurrency-safe container that controls a varying-length sequence of elements of type `std::pair<const K, _Element_type>`. The sequence is represented in a way that enables concurrency-safe append, element access, iterator access and iterator traversal operations.|  
|[concurrent_unordered_multiset Class](concurrent-unordered-multiset-class.md)|The `concurrent_unordered_multiset` class is an concurrency-safe container that controls a varying-length sequence of elements of type K. The sequence is represented in a way that enables concurrency-safe append, element access, iterator access and iterator traversal operations.|

The sequence is represented in a way that enables concurrency-safe append, element access, iterator access and iterator traversal operations.|  
|[concurrent_vector Class](concurrent-vector-class.md)|The `concurrent_vector` class is a sequence container class that allows random access to any element. It enables concurrency-safe append, element access, iterator access, and iterator traversal operations.|

|[IUMSThreadProxy Structure](iumsthreadproxy-structure.md)|An abstraction for a thread of execution. If you want your scheduler to be granted user-mode schedulable (UMS) threads, set the value for the scheduler policy element `SchedulerKind` to `UmsThreadDefault`, and implement the `IUMSScheduler` interface.

|[make_greedy_join Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#make_greedy_join)|Overloaded. Constructs a `greedy multitype_join` messaging block from an optional `Scheduler` or `ScheduleGroup` and two or more input sources.|  
|[make_join Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#make_join)|Overloaded. Constructs a `non_greedy multitype_join` messaging block from an optional `Scheduler` or `ScheduleGroup` and two or more input sources.|  
|[make_task Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#make_task)|A factory method for creating a `task_handle` object.|  
|[parallel_buffered_sort Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_buffered_sort)|Overloaded. Arranges the elements in a specified range into a nondescending order, or according to an ordering criterion specified by a binary predicate, in parallel. This function is semantically similar to `std::sort` in that it is a compare-based, unstable, in-place sort except that it needs `O(n)` additional space, and requires default initialization for the elements being sorted.|  
|[parallel_for Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_for)|Overloaded. `parallel_for` iterates over a range of indices and executes a user-supplied function at each iteration, in parallel.|  
|[parallel_for_each Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_for_each)|Overloaded. `parallel_for_each` applies a specified function to each element within a range, in parallel. It is semantically equivalent to the `for_each` function in the `std` namespace, except that iteration over the elements is performed in parallel, and the order of iteration is unspecified. The argument `_Func` must support a function call operator of the form `operator()(T)` where the parameter `T` is the item type of the container being iterated over.|  
|[parallel_invoke Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_invoke)|Overloaded. Executes the function objects supplied as parameters in parallel, and blocks until they have finished executing. Each function object could be a lambda expression, a pointer to function, or any object that supports the function call operator with the signature `void operator()()`.|  
|[parallel_radixsort Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_radixsort)|Overloaded. Arranges elements in a specified range into an non descending order using a radix sorting algorithm. This is a stable sort function which requires a projection function that can project elements to be sorted into unsigned integer-like keys. Default initialization is required for the elements being sorted.|  
|[parallel_reduce Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_reduce)|Overloaded. Computes the sum of all elements in a specified range by computing successive partial sums, or computes the result of successive partial results similarly obtained from using a specified binary operation other than sum, in parallel. `parallel_reduce` is semantically similar to `std::accumulate`, except that it requires the binary operation to be associative, and requires an identity value instead of an initial value.|  
|[parallel_sort Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_sort)|Overloaded. Arranges the elements in a specified range into a nondescending order, or according to an ordering criterion specified by a binary predicate, in parallel. This function is semantically similar to `std::sort` in that it is a compare-based, unstable, in-place sort.|  
|[parallel_transform Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_transform)|Overloaded. Applies a specified function object to each element in a source range, or to a pair of elements from two source ranges, and copies the return values of the function object into a destination range, in parallel. This functional is semantically equivalent to `std::transform`.|  
|[receive Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#receive)|Overloaded. A general receive implementation, allowing a context to wait for data from exactly one source and filter the values that are accepted.|  
|[run_with_cancellation_token Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#run_with_cancellation_token)|Executes a function object immediately and synchronously in the context of a given cancellation token.|  
|[send Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#send)|Overloaded. A synchronous send operation, which waits until the target either accepts or declines the message.|  
|[set_ambient_scheduler Function (Concurrency Runtime)](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#set_ambient_scheduler)||  
|[set_task_execution_resources Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#set_task_execution_resources)|Overloaded. Restricts the execution resources used by the Concurrency Runtime internal worker threads to the affinity set specified.<br /><br /> It is valid to call this method only before the Resource Manager has been created, or between two Resource Manager lifetimes. It can be invoked multiple times as long as the Resource Manager does not exist at the time of invocation. After an affinity limit has been set, it remains in effect until the next valid call to the `set_task_execution_resources` method.<br /><br /> The affinity mask provided need not be a subset of the process affinity mask. The process affinity will be updated if necessary.|  
|[swap Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#swap)|Exchanges the elements of two `concurrent_vector` objects.|  
|[task_from_exception Function (Concurrency Runtime)](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#task_from_exception)||  
|[task_from_result Function (Concurrency Runtime)](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#task_from_result)||  
|[Trace_agents_register_name Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#trace_agents_register_name)|Associates the given name to the message block or agent in the ETW trace.|  
|[try_receive Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#try_receive)|Overloaded. A general try-receive implementation, allowing a context to look for data from exactly one source and filter the values that are accepted. If the data is not ready, the method will return false.|  
|[wait Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#wait)|Pauses the current context for a specified amount of time.|  
|[when_all Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#when_all)|Creates a task that will complete successfully when all of the tasks supplied as arguments complete successfully.|  
|[when_any Function](concurrency-namespace-functions.md#when_any)|Overloaded. Creates a task that will complete successfully when any of the tasks supplied as arguments completes successfully.|
