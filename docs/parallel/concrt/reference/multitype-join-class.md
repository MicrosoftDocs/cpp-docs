# multitype_join Class
A `multitype_join` messaging block is a multi-source, single-target messaging block that combines together messages of different types from each of its sources and offers a tuple of the combined messages to its targets.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template<
    typename T,  
    join_type _Jtype = non_greedy  
>  
class multitype_join: public ISource<typename _Unwrap<T>::type>;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `T`  
 The `tuple` payload type of the messages joined and propagated by the block.  
  
 `_Jtype`  
 The kind of `join` block this is, either `greedy` or `non_greedy`

## Inheritance Hierarchy  
 [ISource](isource-class.md)  
  
 `multitype_join`  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** agents.h  
  
 **Namespace:** concurrency  
  
##  <a name="accept"></a> accept 

 Accepts a message that was offered by this `multitype_join` block, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```  
virtual message<_Destination_type>* accept(
    runtime_object_identity _MsgId,  
    _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the offered `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the `accept` method.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the message that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
##  <a name="acquire_ref"></a> acquire_ref 

 Acquires a reference count on this `multitype_join` messaging block, to prevent deletion.  
  
```  
virtual void acquire_ref(_Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling this method.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method is called by an `ITarget` object that is being linked to this source during the `link_target` method.  
  
##  <a name="consume"></a> consume 

 Consumes a message previously offered by the `multitype_join` messaging block and successfully reserved by the target, transferring ownership to the caller.  
  
```  
virtual message<_Destination_type>* consume(
    runtime_object_identity _MsgId,  
    _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the reserved `message` object.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the `consume` method.  
  
### Return Value  
 A pointer to the `message` object that the caller now has ownership of.  
  
### Remarks  
 The `consume` method is similar to `accept`, but must always be preceded by a call to `reserve` that returned `true`.  
  
##  <a name="link_target"></a> link_target 

 Links a target block to this `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual void link_target(_Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to an `ITarget` block to link to this `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
##  <a name="ctor"></a> multitype_join 

 Constructs a `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
explicit multitype_join(
    T _Tuple);

 
multitype_join(
    Scheduler& _PScheduler,  
    T _Tuple);

 
multitype_join(
    ScheduleGroup& _PScheduleGroup,  
    T _Tuple);

 
multitype_join(
    multitype_join&& _Join);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_Tuple`  
 A `tuple` of sources for this `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
 `_PScheduler`  
 The `Scheduler` object within which the propagation task for the `multitype_join` messaging block is scheduled.  
  
 `_PScheduleGroup`  
 The `ScheduleGroup` object within which the propagation task for the `multitype_join` messaging block is scheduled. The `Scheduler` object used is implied by the schedule group.  
  
 `_Join`  
 A `multitype_join` messaging block to copy from. Note that the original object is orphaned, making this a move constructor.  
  
### Remarks  
 The runtime uses the default scheduler if you do not specify the `_PScheduler` or `_PScheduleGroup` parameters.  
  
 Move construction is not performed under a lock, which means that it is up to the user to make sure that there are no light-weight tasks in flight at the time of moving. Otherwise, numerous races can occur, leading to exceptions or inconsistent state.  
  
##  <a name="dtor"></a> ~multitype_join 

 Destroys the `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
~multitype_join();
```  
  
##  <a name="release"></a> release 

 Releases a previous successful message reservation.  
  
```  
virtual void release(
    runtime_object_identity _MsgId,  
    _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being released.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the `release` method.  
  
##  <a name="release_ref"></a> release_ref 

 Releases a reference count on this `multiple_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual void release_ref(_Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling this method.  
  
### Remarks  
 This method is called by an `ITarget` object that is being unlinked from this source. The source block is allowed to release any resources reserved for the target block.  
  
##  <a name="reserve"></a> reserve 

 Reserves a message previously offered by this `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual bool reserve(
    runtime_object_identity _MsgId,  
    _Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_MsgId`  
 The `runtime_object_identity` of the `message` object being reserved.  
  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to the target block that is calling the `reserve` method.  
  
### Return Value  
 `true` if the message was successfully reserved, `false` otherwise. Reservations can fail for many reasons, including: the message was already reserved or accepted by another target, the source could deny reservations, and so forth.  
  
### Remarks  
 After you call `reserve`, if it succeeds, you must call either `consume` or `release` in order to take or give up possession of the message, respectively.  
  
##  <a name="unlink_target"></a> unlink_target 

 Unlinks a target block from this `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual void unlink_target(_Inout_ ITarget<_Destination_type>* _PTarget);
```  
  
### Parameters  
 `_PTarget`  
 A pointer to an `ITarget` block to unlink from this `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
##  <a name="unlink_targets"></a> unlink_targets 

 Unlinks all targets from this `multitype_join` messaging block.  
  
```  
virtual void unlink_targets();
```
