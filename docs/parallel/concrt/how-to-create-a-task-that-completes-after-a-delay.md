# How to: Create a Task that Completes After a Delay
This example shows how to use the [concurrency::task](../../parallel/concrt/reference/task-class.md), [concurrency::cancellation_token_source](../../parallel/concrt/reference/cancellation-token-source-class.md), [concurrency::cancellation_token](../../parallel/concrt/reference/cancellation-token-class.md), [concurrency::task_completion_event](../../parallel/concrt/reference/task-completion-event-class.md), [concurrency::timer](../../parallel/concrt/reference/timer-class.md), and [concurrency::call](../../parallel/concrt/reference/call-class.md) classes to create a task that completes after a delay. You can use this method to build loops that occasionally poll for data, introduce timeouts, delay handling of user input for a predetermined time, and so on.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows the `complete_after` and `cancel_after_timeout` functions. The `complete_after` function creates a `task` object that completes after the specified delay. It uses a `timer` object and a `call` object to set a `task_completion_event` object after the specified delay. By using the `task_completion_event` class, you can define a task that completes after a thread or another task signals that a value is available. When the event is set, listener tasks complete and their continuations are scheduled to run.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  For more information about the `timer` and `call` classes, which are part of the Asynchronous Agents Library, see [Asynchronous Message Blocks](../../parallel/concrt/asynchronous-message-blocks.md).  
  
 The `cancel_after_timeout` function builds on the `complete_after` function to cancel a task if that task does not complete before a given timeout. The `cancel_after_timeout` function creates two tasks. The first task indicates success and completes after the provided task completes; the second task indicates failure and completes after the specified timeout. The `cancel_after_timeout` function creates a continuation task that runs when the success or failure task completes. If the failure task completes first, the continuation cancels the token source to cancel the overall task.

## Example  
 The following example computes the count of prime numbers in the range [0, 100000] multiple times. The operation fails if it does not complete in a given time limit. The `count_primes` function demonstrates how to use the `cancel_after_timeout` function. It counts the number of primes in the given range and fails if the task does not complete in the provided time. The `wmain` function calls the `count_primes` function multiple times. Each time, it halves the time limit. The program finishes after the operation does not complete in the current time limit.

 When you use this technique to cancel tasks after a delay, any unstarted tasks will not start after the overall task is canceled. However, it is important for any long-running tasks to respond to cancellation in a timely manner. For more information about task cancellation, see [Cancellation in the PPL](cancellation-in-the-ppl.md).

## Compiling the Code  
 To compile the code, copy it and then paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `task-delay.cpp` and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  
  
 **cl.exe /EHsc task-delay.cpp**
