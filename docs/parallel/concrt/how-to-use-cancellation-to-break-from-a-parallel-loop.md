# How to: Use Cancellation to Break from a Parallel Loop
This example shows how to use cancellation to implement a basic parallel search algorithm.  
  
## Example  

 The following example uses cancellation to search for an element in an array. The `parallel_find_any` function uses the [concurrency::parallel_for](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_for) algorithm and the [concurrency::run_with_cancellation_token](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#run_with_cancellation_token) function to search for the position that contains the given value. When the parallel loop finds the value, it calls the [concurrency::cancellation_token_source::cancel](reference/cancellation-token-source-class.md#cancel) method to cancel future work.  


  
 [!code-cpp[concrt-parallel-array-search#1](../../parallel/concrt/codesnippet/cpp/how-to-use-cancellation-to-break-from-a-parallel-loop_1.cpp)]  
  

 The [concurrency::parallel_for](reference/concurrency-namespace-functions.md#parallel_for) algorithm acts concurrently. Therefore, it does not perform the operations in a pre-determined order. If the array contains multiple instances of the value, the result can be any one of its positions.  

  
## Compiling the Code  
 Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `parallel-array-search.cpp` and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  
  
 **cl.exe /EHsc parallel-array-search.cpp**
