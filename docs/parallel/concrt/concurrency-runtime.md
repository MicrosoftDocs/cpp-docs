# Concurrency Runtime
The Concurrency Runtime for C++ helps you write robust, scalable, and responsive parallel applications. It raises the level of abstraction so that you do not have to manage the infrastructure details that are related to concurrency. You can also use it to specify scheduling policies that meet the quality of service demands of your applications. Use these resources to help you start working with the Concurrency Runtime.  
  
 For reference documentation, see [Reference](../../parallel/concrt/reference/reference-concurrency-runtime.md).  
  
> [!TIP]
>  The Concurrency Runtime relies heavily on C++11 features and adopts the more modern C++ style. To learn more, read  [Welcome Back to C++](../../cpp/welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp.md).
