# &#39;AddressOf&#39; expression cannot be converted to &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; because &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; is not a delegate type
A statement attempts to convert an `AddressOf` expression to a type that is not a delegate type.  
  
 The `AddressOf` operator creates a procedure delegate instance that references a specific procedure. `AddressOf` can be used as the operand of a delegate constructor, or it can be used in a context in which the type of the delegate can be determined by the compiler.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30581  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Change the target type to a delegate type.
