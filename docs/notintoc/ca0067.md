# CA0067
Directory not found.  
  
 The value of the **/directory** option in the FxCopCmd command line was not found.  
  
 This warning can occur if you are using the **CodeAnalysisDependentAssemblyPaths** property of [!INCLUDE[vstecmsbuild](../build/includes/vstecmsbuild_md.md)] to specify additional reference assembly search paths and one of those paths does not exist.  
  
-   If warning CA0067 appears with [CA0058](../notintoc/ca0058.md) errors or [CA0060](../notintoc/ca0060.md) warnings, resolving the other errors usually resolves CA0067.  
  
-   If warning CA0067 appears without other errors or warnings, you can usually ignore the warning because the directory was not needed.
