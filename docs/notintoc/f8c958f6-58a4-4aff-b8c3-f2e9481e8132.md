# Attribute member &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; cannot be the target of an assignment because it is not declared &#39;Public&#39;
An attempt was made to assign a value to a private member of an attribute.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31511  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove the assignment.  
  
2.  If using custom attributes that you developed, change the attribute member's access modifier to `Public`.
