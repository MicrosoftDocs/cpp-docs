# Finding and Sharing Extensions
You can download, install, and manage Visual Studio extensions by using **Extensions and Updates**, which is available on the **Tools** menu. You can also obtain extensions by going to websites such as the [Visual Studio Gallery](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=123847), or by getting them directly from other developers. For more information about how to find and install extensions, see [Finding and Using Visual Studio Extensions](../Topic/Finding%20and%20Using%20Visual%20Studio%20Extensions.md).  
  
 You can also create extensions, wrap them in deployment packages, and share them with other developers by posting them on the Internet, posting them on a network share, or sending them by email. If you wrap an extension in a VSIX deployment package and upload it to the Visual Studio Gallery website, other developers can use **Extensions and Updates** to install it. For more information about VSIX deployment, see [Shipping Visual Studio Extensions](../Topic/Shipping%20Visual%20Studio%20Extensions.md).
