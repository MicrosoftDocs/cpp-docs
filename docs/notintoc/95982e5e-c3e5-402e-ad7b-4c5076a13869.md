# &#39;!&#39; requires its left operand to have a type parameter, class or interface type, but this operand has the type &#39;&lt;type&gt;&#39;
Dictionary member access, which uses an exclamation point (`!`) instead of a period (`.`), is valid only on a class or an interface.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30103  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Replace the expression on the left of the exclamation point with one that evaluates to a defined class or interface type.
