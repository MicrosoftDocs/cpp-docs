# MSBuild Error MSB3151
**MSB3151: Item '\<package>' already includes '\<package>'.**  
  
 This warning occurs when you have selected two bootstrapper packages, and one package is included in the other (for example, selecting the included package is redundant).  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Clear the check box for the redundantly included package.
