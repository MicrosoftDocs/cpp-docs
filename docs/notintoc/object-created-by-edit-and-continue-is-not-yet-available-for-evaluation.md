# Object created by Edit and Continue is not yet available for evaluation
In the Visual Studio debugger, a new object is being created, but it cannot be accessed yet.  
  
 Possible causes for an object to be unavailable include memory allocation failure and object state out of synchronization. These are temporary internal conditions and usually not a result of input to the debugger.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30958  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Terminate and restart debugging.
