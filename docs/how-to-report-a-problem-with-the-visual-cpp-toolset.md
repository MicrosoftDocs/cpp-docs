# How to report a problem with the Visual C++ toolset or documentation

If you encounter problems with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, linker, or other tools and libraries, we want to know about them. If the issue is in our documentation, we want to know about that, too.

## How to report a C++ toolset issue

The best way to let us know about a problem is to send us a report that includes a description of the problem you've encountered, details about how you're building your program, and a *repro*, a complete test case we can use to reproduce the problem on our own machines. This information lets us quickly verify that the problem exists in our code and is not local to your environment, to determine whether it affects other versions of the compiler, and to diagnose its cause.

In the sections below, you'll read about what makes a good report, how to generate a repro for the kind of issue you've found, and how to send your report to the product team. Your reports are important to us and to other developers like you. Thank you for helping us improve Visual C++!

## How to prepare your report

Creating a high-quality report is important because it is very difficult to reproduce the problem you encountered on our own machines without complete information. The better your report is, the more effectively we are able recreate and diagnose the problem.

At a minimum, your report should contain

- The full version information of the toolset you're using.

- The full cl.exe command line used to build your code.

- A detailed description of the problem you encountered.

- A repro: a complete, simplified, self-contained source code example that demonstrates the problem.

Read on to learn more about the specific information we need and where you can find it, and how to create a good repro.

### The toolset version

We need the full version information and the target architecture of the toolset that causes the problem so that we can test your repro against the same toolset on our machines. If we can reproduce the problem, this information also gives us a starting point to investigate which other versions of the toolset exhibit the same problem.

#### To report the full version of the compiler you're using

1. Open the **Developer Command Prompt** that matches the Visual Studio version and configuration architecture used to build your project. For example, if you build by using Visual Studio 2017 on x64 for x64 targets, choose **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017**. For more information, see [Developer command prompt shortcuts](build/building-on-the-command-line.md#developer-command-prompt-shortcuts).

1. In the developer command prompt console window, enter the command **cl /Bv**.

The output should look similar to this:

```Output
C:\Users\username\Source>cl /Bv
Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.14.26428.1 for x86
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

cl : Command line error D8003 : missing source filename
```

Copy and paste the entire output into your report.

### The command line

We need the exact command line (cl.exe and all of its arguments) used to build your code, so that we can build it in exactly the same way on our machines. This is important because the problem you've encountered might only exist when building with a certain argument or combination of arguments.

The best place to find this information is in the build log immediately after experiencing the problem. This ensures that the command line contains exactly the same arguments that might be contributing to the problem.

#### To report the contents of the command line

1. Locate the **CL.command.1.tlog** file and open it. By default, this file is located in your Documents folder in \\Visual Studio *version*\\Projects\\*SolutionName*\\*ProjectName*\\*Configuration*\\*ProjectName*.tlog\\CL.command.1.tlog, or in your User folder under \\Source\\Repos\\*SolutionName*\\*ProjectName*\\*Configuration*\\*ProjectName*.tlog\\CL.command.1.tlog. It may be in a different location if you use another build system or if you have changed the default location for your project.

   Inside this file, you'll find the names of source code files followed by the command line arguments used to compile them, each on separate lines.

1. Locate the line that contains the name of the source code file where the problem occurs; the line below it contains the corresponding cl.exe command arguments.

Copy and paste the entire command line into your report.

### A description of the problem

We need a detailed description of the problem you've encountered so that we can verify that we see the same effect on our machines; its also sometimes useful for us to know what you were trying to accomplish, and what you expected to happen.

Please provide the **exact error messages** given by the toolset, or the exact runtime behavior you see. We need this information to verify that we've properly reproduced the issue. Please include **all** of the compiler output, not just the last error message. We need to see everything that led up to the issue you report. If you can duplicate the issue by using the command line compiler, that compiler output is preferred; the IDE and other build systems may filter the error messages you see, or only capture the first line of an error message.

If the issue is that the compiler accepts invalid code and does not generate a diagnostic, please note this in your report.

To report a runtime behavior problem, include an **exact copy** of what the program prints out, and what you expect to see. Ideally, this is embedded in the output statement itself, for example, `printf("This should be 5: %d\n", actual_result);`. If your program crashes or hangs, mention that as well.

Add any other details that might help us diagnose the problem you experienced, such as any work-arounds you may have found. Avoid repeating information found elsewhere in your report.

### The repro

A repro is a complete, self-contained source code example that reproducibly demonstrates the problem you've encountered (hence the name). We need a repro so that we can reproduce the error on our machines. The code should be sufficient by itself to create a simple executable that compiles and runs, or that would compile and run if not for the problem you've found. A repro is not a code snippet; it should have complete functions and classes and contain all the necessary #include directives, even for the standard headers.

#### What makes a good repro

A good repro is:

- **Minimal.** Repros should be as small as possible yet still demonstrate exactly the problem you encountered. Repros do not need to be complex or realistic; they only need to show code that conforms to the Standard or the documented compiler implementation, or in the case of a missing diagnostic, the code that is not conformant. Simple, to-the-point repros that contain just enough code to demonstrate the problem are best. If you can eliminate or simplify the code and remain conformant and also leave the issue unchanged, please do so. You do not need to include counter-examples of code that works.

- **Self-Contained.** Repros should avoid unnecessary dependencies. If you can reproduce the problem without third-party libraries, please do so. If you can reproduce the problem without any library code besides simple output statements (for example, `puts("this shouldn't compile");`, `std::cout << value;`, and `printf("%d\n", value);` are okay), please do so. It's ideal if the example can be condensed to a single source code file, without reference to any user headers. Reducing the amount of code we have to consider as a possible contributor to the problem is enormously helpful to us.

- **Against the latest compiler version.** Repros should use the most recent update to the latest version of the toolset, or the most recent prerelease version of the next update or next major release, whenever possible. Problems you may encounter in older versions of the toolset have very often been fixed in newer versions. Fixes are backported to older versions only in exceptional circumstances.

- **Checked against other compilers** if relevant. Repros that involve portable C++ code should verify behavior against other compilers if possible. The Standard ultimately determines program correctness, and no compiler is perfect, but when Clang and GCC accept your code without a diagnostic and MSVC does not, it's likely you're looking at a bug in our compiler. (Other possibilities include differences in Unix and Windows behavior, or different levels of C++ standards implementation, and so on.) On the other hand, if all the compilers reject your code, then it's likely that your code is incorrect. Seeing different error messages may help you diagnose the issue yourself.

   You can find lists of online compilers to test your code against in [Online C++ compilers](https://isocpp.org/blog/2013/01/online-c-compilers) on the ISO C++ website, or this curated [List of Online C++ Compilers](https://arnemertz.github.io/online-compilers/) on GitHub. Some specific examples include [Wandbox](https://wandbox.org/), [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/), and [Coliru](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/).

   > [!NOTE]
   > The online compiler websites are not affiliated with Microsoft. Many online compiler websites are run as personal projects, and some of these sites may not be available when you read this, but a search should find others you can use.

Problems in the compiler, linker, and in the libraries, tend to show themselves in particular ways. The kind of problem you encounter will determine what kind of repro you should include in your report. Without an appropriate repro, we have nothing to investigate. Here are a few of the kinds of issues that you may see, and instructions for generating the kinds of repros you should use to report each kind of problems.

#### Frontend (parser) crash

Frontend crashes occur during the parsing phase of the compiler. Typically, the compiler will emit [Fatal Error C1001](error-messages/compiler-errors-1/fatal-error-c1001.md) and reference the source code file and line number on which the error occurred; it will often mention a file msc1.cpp, but you can ignore this detail.

For this kind of crash, please provide a [Preprocessed Repro](#preprocessed-repros).

Here's example compiler output for this kind of crash:

```Output
SandBoxHost.cpp
d:\o\dev\search\foundation\common\tools\sandbox\managed\managed.h(929):
        fatal error C1001: An internal error has occurred in the compiler.
(compiler file 'msc1.cpp', line 1369)
To work around this problem, try simplifying or changing the program near the
        locations listed above.
Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++
Help menu, or open the Technical Support help file for more information
d:\o\dev\search\foundation\common\tools\sandbox\managed\managed.h(929):
        note: This diagnostic occurred in the compiler generated function
        'void Microsoft::Ceres::Common::Tools::Sandbox::SandBoxedProcess::Dispose(bool)'
Internal Compiler Error in d:\o\dev\otools\bin\x64\cl.exe.  You will be prompted
        to send an error report to Microsoft later.
INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR in 'd:\o\dev\otools\bin\x64\cl.exe'
    Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++
    Help menu, or open the Technical Support help file for more information
```

#### Backend (code generation) crash

Backend crashes occur during the code generation phase of the compiler. Typically, the compiler will emit [Fatal Error C1001](error-messages/compiler-errors-1/fatal-error-c1001.md), and might not reference the source code file and line number associated with the problem; it will often mention the file compiler\\utc\\src\\p2\\main.c, but you can ignore this detail.

For this kind of crash, please provide a [Link repro](#link-repros) if you are using Link-Time Code Generation (LTCG), enabled by the **/GL** command-line argument to cl.exe. If not, please provide a [Preprocessed repro](#preprocessed-repros) instead.

Here's example compiler output for a backend crash in which LTCG is not used. If your compiler output looks like this you should provide a [Preprocessed Repro](#preprocessed-repros).

```Output
repro.cpp
\\officefile\public\tadg\vc14\comperror\repro.cpp(13) : fatal error C1001:
        An internal error has occurred in the compiler.
(compiler file 'f:\dd\vctools\compiler\utc\src\p2\main.c', line 230)
To work around this problem, try simplifying or changing the program near the
        locations listed above.
Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++
Help menu, or open the Technical Support help file for more information
INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR in
        'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\BIN\cl.exe'
    Please choose the Technical Support command on the Visual C++
    Help menu, or open the Technical Support help file for more information
```

If the line that begins with **INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR** mentions link.exe, rather than cl.exe, LTCG was enabled and you should provide a [Link Repro](#link-repros). If its not clear whether LTCG was enabled from the compiler error message, you may need to examine the command line arguments that you copied from your build log in a previous step for the **/GL** command-line argument.

#### Linker crash

Linker crashes occur during the linking phase, after the compiler has run. Typically, the linker will emit [Linker Tools Error LNK1000](error-messages/tool-errors/linker-tools-error-lnk1000.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If the output mentions C1001 or involves Link-Time Code Generation, refer to [Backend (code generation) crash](#backend-code-generation-crash) instead for more information.

For this kind of crash, please provide a [Link repro](#link-repros).

Here's example compiler output for this kind of crash.

```Output
z:\foo.obj : error LNK1000: Internal error during IMAGE::Pass2

  Dr2    = 0000000000000000  Dr7    = 0000000000000000
```

If incremental linking is enabled and the crash occurred only after a successful initial link, (that is, only after the first full linking on which subsequent incremental linking is based) please also provide a copy of the object (.obj) and library (.lib) files that correspond to source files that were modified after the initial link was completed.

#### Bad code generation

Bad code generation is rare, but occurs when the compiler mistakenly generates incorrect code that will cause your application to crash at runtime rather than detecting this problem at compile-time. If you believe the problem you are experiencing results in bad code generation, treat your report the same as a [Backend (code generation) crash](#backend-code-generation-crash).

For this kind of crash please provide a [Link repro](#link-repros) if you are using Link-Time Code Generation (LTCG), enabled by the **/GL** command-line argument to cl.exe. Please provide a [Preprocessed repro](#preprocessed-repros) if not.

## How to generate a repro

To help us track down the source of the problem, a [good repro](#what-makes-a-good-repro) is vital. Before you do any of the steps outlined below for specific kinds of repros, try to condense the code that demonstrates the problem as much as possible. Try to eliminate or minimize dependencies, required headers, and libraries, and limit the compiler options and preprocessor definitions used if possible.

Below are instructions for generating the various kinds of repros you'll use to report different kinds of problems.

### Preprocessed repros

A *preprocessed repro* is a single source file that demonstrates a problem, generated from the output of the C preprocessor by using the **/P** compiler option on the original repro source file. This inlines included headers to remove dependencies on additional source and header files, and also resolves macros, #ifdefs, and other preprocessor commands that could depend your local environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Preprocessed repros are not as useful for problems that might be the result of bugs in our standard library implementation, because we will often want to substitute our latest, in-progress implementation to see whether we've already fixed the problem. In this case, don't preprocess the repro, and if you can't reduce the problem to a single source file, package your code into a .zip file or similar, or consider using an IDE project repro. For more information, see [Other repros](#other-repros).

#### To preprocess a source code file

1. Capture the command line arguments used to build your repro, as described in [To report the contents of the command line](#to-report-the-contents-of-the-command-line).

1. Open the **Developer Command Prompt** that matches the Visual Studio version and configuration architecture used to build your project.

1. Change to the directory that contains your repro project.

1. In the developer command prompt console window, enter the command **cl /P** *arguments* *filename.cpp*, where *arguments* is the list of arguments captured above, and *filename.cpp* is the name of your repro source file. This command replicates the command line used for the repro, but stops the compilation after the preprocessor pass, and outputs the preprocessed source code to *filename*.i.

If you are preprocessing a C++/CX source code file, or you are using the C++ Modules feature, some additional steps are required. For more information, see the sections below.

After you have generated the preprocessed file, its a good idea to make sure that the problem still repros using the preprocessed file.

#### To confirm that the error still repros with the preprocessed file

1. In the developer command prompt console window, enter the command **cl** *arguments* **/TP** *filename*.i to tell cl.exe to compile the preprocessed file as a C++ source file, where *arguments* is the list of arguments captured above, but with any **/D** and **/I** arguments removed (because they have already been included in the preprocessed file); and where *filename*.i is the name of your preprocessed file.

1. Confirm that the problem is reproduced.

Finally, attach the preprocessed repro *filename*.i to your report.

### Preprocessed C++/CX WinRT/UWP code repros

If you're using C++/CX to build your executable, there are some extra steps required to create and validate a preprocessed repro.

#### To preprocess C++/CX source code

1. Create a preprocessed source file as described in [To preprocess a source code file](#to-preprocess-a-source-code-file).

1. Search the generated _filename_.i file for **#using** directives.

1. Make a list of all of the referenced files. Leave out any Windows\*.winmd files, platform.winmd files, and mscorlib.dll.

To prepare to validate that the preprocessed file still reproduces the problem,

1. Create a new directory for the preprocessed file and copy it to the new directory.

1. Copy the .winmd files from your **#using** list to the new directory.

1. Create an empty vccorlib.h file in the new directory.

1. Edit the preprocessed file to remove any **#using** directives for mscorlib.dll.

1. Edit the preprocessed file to change any absolute paths to just the bare filenames for the copied .winmd files.

Confirm that the preprocessed file still reproduces the problem, as above.

### Preprocessed C++ Modules repros

If you're using the Modules feature of the C++ compiler, there are some different steps required to create and validate a preprocessed repro.

#### To preprocess a source code file that uses a module

1. Capture the command line arguments used to build your repro, as described in [To report the contents of the command line](#to-report-the-contents-of-the-command-line).

1. Open the **Developer Command Prompt** that matches the Visual Studio version and configuration architecture used to build your project.

1. Change to the directory that contains your repro project.

1. In the developer command prompt console window, enter the command **cl /P** *arguments* *filename.cpp*, where *arguments* is the list of arguments captured above, and *filename.cpp* is the name of the source file that consumes the module.

1. Change to the directory that contains the repro project that built the module interface (the .ifc output).

1. Capture the command line arguments used to build your module interface.

1. In the developer command prompt console window, enter the command **cl /P** *arguments* *modulename.ixx*, where *arguments* is the list of arguments captured above, and *modulename.ixx* is the name of the file that creates the module interface.

After you have generated the preprocessed files, its a good idea to make sure the problem still repros using the preprocessed file.

#### To confirm that the error still repros with the preprocessed file

1. In the developer console window, change back to the directory that contains your repro project.

1. Enter the command **cl** *arguments* **/TP** *filename*.i as above, to compile the preprocessed file as if it were a C++ source file.

1. Confirm that the problem is still reproduced by the preprocessed file.

Finally, attach the preprocessed repro files (*filename*.i and *modulename*.i) along with the .ifc output to your report.

### Link repros

A *link repro* is the linker-generated contents of a directory specified by the **link\_repro** environment variable. It contains build artifacts that collectively demonstrate a problem that occurs at link time, such as a backend crash involving Link-Time Code Generation (LTCG), or a linker crash. These build artifacts are the ones needed as linker input so that the problem can be reproduced. A link repro can be created easily by using this environment variable to enable the built-in repro generation capability of the linker.

#### To generate a link repro

1. Capture the command line arguments used to build your repro, as described in [To report the contents of the command line](#to-report-the-contents-of-the-command-line).

1. Open the **Developer Command Prompt** that matches the Visual Studio version and configuration architecture used to build your project.

1. In the developer command prompt console window, change to the directory that contains your repro project.

1. Enter **mkdir linkrepro** to create a directory for the link repro.

1. Enter the command **set link\_repro=linkrepro** to set the **link\_repro** environment variable to the directory you just created. If your build is run from a different directory, as is often the case for more complex projects, then set **link\_repro** to the full path to your linkrepro directory instead.

1. To build the repro project in Visual Studio, in the developer command prompt console window, enter the command **devenv**. This ensures that the value of the **link\_repro** environment variable is visible to Visual Studio. To build the project at the command line, use the command line arguments captured above to duplicate the repro build.

1. Build your repro project, and confirm that the expected problem has occurred.

1. Close Visual Studio if you used it to perform the build.

1. In the developer command prompt console window, enter the command **set link\_repro=** to clear the **link\_repro** environment variable.

Finally, package the repro by compressing the entire linkrepro directory into a .zip file or similar and attach it to your report.

### Other repros

If you can't reduce the problem to a single source file or preprocessed repro, and the problem does not require a link repro, we can investigate an IDE project. All the guidance on how to create a good repro still applies; the code should be minimal and self-contained, the problem should occur in our most recent tools, and if relevant, the problem should not be seen in other compilers.

Create your repro as a minimal IDE project, then package it by compressing the entire directory structure into a .zip file or similar and attach it to your report.

## Ways to send your report

There are a couple of good ways to get your report to us. You can use Visual Studio's built-in [Report a Problem Tool](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio-2017), or the [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/) pages. You can also get directly to our Developer Community pages by choosing the **Product feedback** button at the bottom of this page. The choice depends on whether you want to use the tools built into the IDE for capturing screenshots and organizing your report for posting on the Developer Community pages, or if you'd prefer to use the website directly.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of how you submit your report, Microsoft respects your privacy. Microsoft is committed to compliance with all data privacy laws and regulations. For information about how we treat the data that you send us, see the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

### Use the Report a Problem tool

The **Report a Problem** tool in Visual Studio is a way for Visual Studio users to report a variety of problems with just a few clicks. It provides a simple form that you can use to specify detailed information about the problem you've encountered and then submit your report without ever leaving the IDE.

Reporting your problem through the **Report a Problem** tool is easy and convenient from the IDE. You can access it from the title bar by choosing the **Send Feedback** icon next to the **Quick Launch** search box, or you can find it on the menu bar in **Help** > **Send Feedback** > **Report a Problem**.

When you choose to report a problem, first search the Developer Community for similar problems. If your problem has been reported before, upvote the topic and add comments with additional specifics. If you don't see a similar problem, choose the **Report new problem** button at the bottom of the Visual Studio Feedback dialog and follow the steps to report your problem.

### Use the Visual Studio Developer Community pages

The Visual Studio Developer Community pages are another convenient way to report problems and find solutions for Visual Studio, the C++ compiler, tools, and libraries. The [Visual Studio Questions](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/8/index.html) page is where to report problems with the IDE or installation. For issues with the C++ compiler, linker, and other tools and libraries, use the [C++ Questions](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/62/index.html) page.

In the Developer Community banner near the top of each page is a search box you can use to find posts or topics that report problems similar to yours. You may find that a solution or other useful information related to your problem is already available in an existing topic. If someone has reported the same problem before, please upvote and comment on that topic rather than create a new problem report.

If your problem has not been reported before, choose the **Report a problem** button next to the search box on the Developer Community page. You may be asked to sign in to your Visual Studio account and to agree to give the Developer Community app access to your profile. When you are signed in, you go directly to a page where you can report the problem. You can include your repro code and command line, screen shots, links to related discussions, and any other information you think is relevant and useful.

> For other kinds of problems you might encounter in Visual Studio that are not related to the toolset (For example, UI issues, broken IDE functionality, or general crashes), the **Report a Problem tool** can be an especially good choice due to its screenshot capabilities and its ability to record UI actions that lead to the problem you've encountered. These kinds of errors can also be reported on the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/) site.

### Reports and privacy

By default, **all information in reports and any comments and replies are publicly visible**. Normally, this is a benefit, because it allows the entire community to see the issues, solutions, and workarounds other users have found. However, if you're concerned about making your data or identity public, for privacy or intellectual property reasons, you have options.

If you are concerned about revealing your identity, [create a new Microsoft account](https://signup.live.com/) that does not disclose any details about you. Use this account to create your report. 

**Don't put anything you want to keep private in the title or content of the initial report, which is public.** Instead, note that you will send details privately in a separate comment. To make sure that your report is directed to the right people, include **cppcompiler** in the topic list of your problem report. Once the problem report is created, it's now possible to specify who can see your replies and attachments.

#### To create a problem report for private information

1. In the report you created, choose **Add comment** to create your private description of the problem.

1. In the reply editor, use the dropdown control below the **Submit** and **Cancel** buttons to specify the audience for your reply. Only the people you specify can see these private replies and any images, links, or code you include in them. Choose **Viewable by moderators and the original poster** to limit visibility to Microsoft employees and yourself.

1. Add the description and any other information, images, and file attachments needed for your repro. Choose the **Submit** button to send this information privately.

   Note that there is a 2GB limit on attached files, and a maximum of 10 files. For any larger uploads, please request an upload URL in your private comment.

Any replies under this comment have the same restricted visibility you specified. This is true even if the dropdown control on replies does not show the restricted visibility status correctly.

To maintain your privacy and keep your sensitive information out of public view, please take care to keep all interaction with Microsoft to replies under this restricted comment. Replies to other comments may cause you to accidentally disclose sensitive information.

## How to report a C++ documentation issue

We use GitHub issues to track problems reported in our documentation. You can now create GitHub issues directly from a content page, which enables you interact in a much richer way with writers and product teams. If you see an issue with a document, a bad code sample, a confusing explanation, a critical omission, or even just a typo, you can easily let us know. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Sign in to give documentation feedback**. You'll need to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already, but once you do, you can see all of our documentation issues, their status, and get notifications when changes are made for the issue you reported. For more information, see [A New Feedback System Is Coming to docs.microsoft.com](/teamblog/a-new-feedback-system-is-coming-to-docs).

When you create a documentation issue on GitHub by using the documentation feedback button, the issue is automatically filled in with some information about the page you created the issue on, so we know where the problem is located. Please don't edit this information. Just append the details about what's wrong and, if you like, a suggested fix. [Our documentation is open source](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cpp-docs/), so if you'd like to actually make a fix and propose it yourself, you can do that. For more information about how you can contribute to our documentation, see our [Contributing guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cpp-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub.
