# Building External Projects
An external project is a Visual C++ project that uses a makefile or other facilities that are outside (foreign or external to) the Visual C++ development environment.  
  
 If you have an external project (for example, a makefile project) that you want to build in the Visual C++ development environment, create a Makefile project and specify your project's build command and output in the Makefile Application Wizard. For more information, see [Creating a Makefile Project](../ide/creating-a-makefile-project.md).  
  
 Note that Visual C++ no longer supports the ability to export a makefile for the active project from the development environment. Use [Devenv Command Line Switches](/visualstudio/ide/reference/devenv-command-line-switches) to build Visual Studio projects at the command line.
