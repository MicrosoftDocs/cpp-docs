# Walkthrough: Deploying a Visual C++ Application By Using a Setup Project

Describes how to use a setup project to deploy a Visual C++ application.

## Prerequisites

You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:

- A computer with Visual Studio installed.

- An additional computer that doesn't have the Visual C++ libraries.

### To deploy an application by using a setup project

1. Create a new project. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.

1. Use the **MFC ApplicationWizard** to create a new Visual Studio solution. To find the wizard, from the **New Project** dialog box, expand the **Visual C++** node, select **MFC**, select **MFC Application**, enter a name for the project, and then click **OK**. Click **Finish**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the **MFC Application** type is missing:<br/>
   > **Visual Studio 2017**: Select **Open Visual Studio Installer** in the left pane of the **New Project** dialog box. Install the option located under **Desktop development with C++** in the **Optional** components section, named **Visual C++ MFC for x86 and x64**.<br/>
   > **Visual Studio 2015**: Click on the Windows Start button and type **Add Remove Programs**. Open the program from the results list and then find your Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 installation in the list of installed programs. Double-click it, then choose **Modify** and select the **Microsoft Foundation Classes** component under **Visual C++**.

1. Change the active solution configuration to **Release**. From the **Build** menu, select **Configuration Manger**. From the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, select **Release** from the **Active solution configuration** drop-down box. Click **Close**.

1. Press **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**B** to build the application. Or, on the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**. Building the application enables the setup project to use the output of this MFC application project.

1. If you havenâ€™t already done so, download the Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects extension. The extension is free for Visual Studio developers and adds the functionality of the setup and deployment project templates to Visual Studio. When you're connected to the Internet, in Visual Studio, choose **Tools** > **Extensions and Updates**. Under the **Extensions and Updates** dialog, select the **Online** tab and type *Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects* in the search box. Hit **Enter**, select **Microsoft Visual Studio \<version> Installer Projects**, and click **Download**. Choose to run and install the extension, then restart Visual Studio.

1. On the menu bar, choose **File** > **Recent Projects and Solutions**, and then choose to reopen your project.

1. On the menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **Project** to open the **New Project** dialog box. Then in the left pane of the dialog box, expand the **Installed** > **Other Project Types** nodes, and select **Visual Studio Installer**. In the center pane, select **Setup Project**.

1. Enter a name for the setup project in the **Name** box. In the **Solution** drop-down list, select **Add to solution**. Choose the **OK** button to create the setup project. A **File Assistant (ProjectName)** tab opens in the editor window.

1. Right-click the **Application Folder** node and select **Add** > **Project Output** to open the **Add Project Output Group** dialog box. In the dialog box, select **Primary Output** and click **OK**. A new item named **Primary Output from ProjectName (Active)** appears.

1. Right-click the **Application Folder** node and select **Add** > **Assembly** to open the **Select Component** dialog box. Select and add any required DLLs needed by the program, as described by the article [Determining Which DLLs to Redistribute](determining-which-dlls-to-redistribute.md).

1. Select the item **Primary Output from ProjectName (Active)**, right-click and choose **Create Shortcut to Primary Output from ProjectName (Active)**. A new item named **Shortcut to Primary Output from ProjectName (Active)** appears. You may rename the shortcut item, then drag and drop the item into the **User's Programs Menu** node on the left side of the window.

1. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Configuration Manager**. In the **Project** table, under the **Build** column, check the box for the deployment project. Click **Close**.

1. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution** to build the MFC project and the deployment project.

1. In the solution folder, locate the setup.exe program that was built from the deployment project. You can copy this file (and the .msi file) to install the application and its required library files on another computer. Run the setup program on a second computer that doesn't have the Visual C++ libraries.
