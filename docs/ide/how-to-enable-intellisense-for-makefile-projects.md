# How to: Enable IntelliSense for Makefile Projects
IntelliSense fails to operate in the IDE for Visual C++ makefile projects when certain project settings, or compiler options, are set up incorrectly. Use this procedure to configure Visual C++ makefile projects, so that IntelliSense works when makefile projects are open in the Visual Studio development environment.  
  
### To enable IntelliSense for makefile projects in the IDE  
  
1.  Open the **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).  
  
2.  Expand the **Configuration Properties** node.  
  
3.  Select the **NMake** property page, and then modify properties under **IntelliSense** as appropriate.  
  
    -   Set the **Preprocessor Definitions** property to define any preprocessor symbols in your makefile project. See [/D (Preprocessor Definitions)](../build/reference/d-preprocessor-definitions.md), for more information.  
  
    -   Set the **Include Search Path** property to specify the list of directories that the compiler will search to resolve file references that are passed to preprocessor directives in your makefile project. See [/I (Additional Include Directories)](../build/reference/i-additional-include-directories.md), for more information.  
  
         For projects that are built using CL.EXE from a Command Window, set the **INCLUDE** environment variable to specify directories that the compiler will search to resolve file references that are passed to preprocessor directives in your makefile project.  
  
    -   Set the **Forced Includes** property to specify which header files to process when building your makefile project. See [/FI (Name Forced Include File)](../build/reference/fi-name-forced-include-file.md), for more information.  
  
    -   Set the **Assembly Search Path** property to specify the list of directories that the compiler will search to resolve references to .NET assemblies in your project. See [/AI (Specify Metadata Directories)](../build/reference/ai-specify-metadata-directories.md), for more information.  
  
    -   Set the **Forced Using Assemblies** property to specify which .NET assemblies to process when building your makefile project. See [/FU (Name Forced #using File)](../build/reference/fu-name-forced-hash-using-file.md), for more information.  
  
    -   Set the **Additional Options** property to specify additional compiler switches to be used by IntelliSense when parsing C++ files.  
  
4.  Click **OK** to close the property pages.  
  
5.  Use the **Save All** command to save the modified project settings.  
  
 The next time you open your makefile project in the Visual Studio development environment, run the **Clean Solution** command and then the **Build Solution** command on your makefile project. IntelliSense should work properly in the IDE.
