# Understanding Custom Build Steps and Build Events
From within the Visual C++ development environment, there are three basic ways to customize the build process:  
  
 **Custom Build Steps**  
 A custom build step is a build rule associated with a project. A custom build step can specify a command line to execute, any additional input or output files, and a message to display. For more information, see [How to: Add a Custom Build Step to MSBuild Projects](../build/how-to-add-a-custom-build-step-to-msbuild-projects.md).  
  
 **Custom Build Tools**  
 A custom build tool is a build rule associated with one or more files. A custom build step can pass input files to a custom build tool, which results in one or more output files. For example, the help files in an MFC application are built with a custom build tool. For more information, see [How to: Add Custom Build Tools to MSBuild Projects](../build/how-to-add-custom-build-tools-to-msbuild-projects.md) and [Specifying Custom Build Tools](../ide/specifying-custom-build-tools.md).  
  
 **Build Events**  
 Build events let you customize a project's build. There are three build events: *pre-build*, *pre-link*, and *post-build*. A build event lets you specify an action to occur at a specific time in the build process. For example, you could use a build event to register a file with **regsvr32.exe** after the project finishes building. For more information, see [Specifying Build Events](../ide/specifying-build-events.md).  
  
 [Troubleshooting Build Customizations](../ide/troubleshooting-build-customizations.md) can help you ensure that your custom build steps and build events run as expected.  
  
 The output format of a custom build step or build event can also enhance the usability of the tool. For more information, see [Formatting the Output of a Custom Build Step or Build Event](../ide/formatting-the-output-of-a-custom-build-step-or-build-event.md).  
  
 Build events and custom build steps run in the following order along with other build steps:  
  
1.  Pre-Build event  
  
2.  Custom build tools on individual files  
  
3.  MIDL  
  
4.  Resource compiler  
  
5.  The C/C++ compiler  
  
6.  Pre-Link event  
  
7.  Linker or Librarian (as appropriate)  
  
8.  Manifest Tool  
  
9. BSCMake  
  
10. Custom build step on the project  
  
11. Post-Build event  
  
 The `custom build step on the project` and a `post-build event` run sequentially after all other build processes finish.
