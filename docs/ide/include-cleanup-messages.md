# Include Cleanup messages

This article describes the messages generated by the Include Cleanup feature. For more information about Include Cleanup, see [C/C++ Include Cleanup overview](include-cleanup-overview.md).

Starting with 17.8 Preview 1, Visual Studio can clean up your `#include`s to improve the quality of your C and C++ code in the following ways:

- Offers to add header files for code that compiles only because a needed header file is included indirectly by another header file.
- Offers to remove unused header files--improving build times.

You can choose whether messages from Include Cleanup appear in the form of suggestions, warnings, or errors in the Error List window. For more information, see [Config C/C++ Include Cleanup in Visual Studio](include-cleanup-config.md).

In the following screenshot of the Error List, Include Cleanup is configured to show unused headers with a warning:

The dropdown filter is set to Build + IntelliSense. A warning is visible: VCIC002 - #include < iostream > isn't used in this file."

Include Cleanup generates the following messages:

## `VCIC001`: Content from #include is used in this file and transitively included

This message means that you're using content from a header file that is included indirectly.

For example, you may be directly including a header file that also contains `#include <string>`. If you use `string` in your code, but don't `#include <string>` in that file, it works as long as the other header file continues to indirectly include `<string>` for you. This message identifies this situation in your code so that you can take action to directly include the transitively included header file. For more information, see [Direct vs indirect headers](include-cleanup-overview.md#direct-vs-indirect-headers).

## `VCIC002`: #include is not used in this file

This message means that the specified header file is not used in the current file. You can remove the associated `#include` directive to clean up your `#include`s and improve your build times.
