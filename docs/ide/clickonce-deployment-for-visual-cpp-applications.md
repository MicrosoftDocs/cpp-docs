# ClickOnce Deployment for Visual C++ Applications
Visual Studio provides two different technologies for deploying Windows applications: ClickOnce deployment or [Windows Installer](/windows/desktop/Msi/windows-installer-portal) deployment.  
  
## ClickOnce Deployment in C++  
 The Visual C++ development environment does not directly support deployment of Visual C++ projects with ClickOnce, but tools are available to use it.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Visual Studio does support ClickOnce in the Visual C# and Visual Basic development environments. If your Visual C++ project is a dependency of a Visual C# project, you can publish the application (including its dependencies) using ClickOnce deployment from the Visual C# development environment.  
  
 To deploy a Visual C++ application using ClickOnce, you first have to build a [ClickOnce Application Manifest](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-application-manifest) and a [ClickOnce Deployment Manifest](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-deployment-manifest) using the [Mage.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool)](/dotnet/framework/tools/mage-exe-manifest-generation-and-editing-tool) or its graphical user interface version (for information, see [MageUI.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool, Graphical Client)](/dotnet/framework/tools/mageui-exe-manifest-generation-and-editing-tool-graphical-client)).  

  
 You first use Mage.exe to build the application manifest; the resulting file will have the extension .manifest. You then use Mage.exe to build the deployment manifest; the resulting file will have the extension .application. You then sign the manifests.  
  
 The application manifest must specify the target processor (**x86**, **x64**, or **ARM**). See [Deploying Prerequisites for 64-bit Applications](/visualstudio/deployment/deploying-prerequisites-for-64-bit-applications) for information on these options.  
  
 Also, the name of the application and deployment manifests must be different from the name of the C++ application. This avoids conflict between the application manifest created by Mage.exe and the external manifest that is part of the C++ application.  
  
 Your deployment will need to install any Visual C++ libraries on which your application depends. To determine the dependencies for a particular application, you can use depends.exe or the DUMPBIN utility with the /DEPENDENTS option. For more information on dependencies, see [Understanding the Dependencies of a Visual C++ Application](../ide/understanding-the-dependencies-of-a-visual-cpp-application.md). You might need to run VCRedist.exe; this utility installs Visual C++ libraries on the target computer.  
  
 You may also need to build a bootstrapper (prerequisites installer) for your application to deploy prerequisite components; for information on the bootstrapper, see [Creating Bootstrapper Packages](/visualstudio/deployment/creating-bootstrapper-packages).  
  
 For a more detailed description of the technology, see [ClickOnce Security and Deployment](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment). For a detailed example of ClickOnce deployment, see [Walkthrough: Manually Deploying a ClickOnce Application](/visualstudio/deployment/walkthrough-manually-deploying-a-clickonce-application).
