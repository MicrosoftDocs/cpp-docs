# Adding an Event (Visual C++)
From Class View, you can add an event using the [Add Event Wizard](../ide/add-event-wizard.md) only to the control class in your [MFC ActiveX control](../mfc/reference/creating-an-mfc-activex-control.md) project. If you want to add an event to another type of project, use the **Events** button in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).  
  
### To add an event to your MFC ActiveX control project  
  
1.  In Class View, expand the project node to display the classes in the project.  
  
2.  Right-click the project's control class.  
  
3.  On the shortcut menu, click **Add**, and then click **Add Event** to display the Add Event Wizard.  
  
4.  Provide the event information in the appropriate wizard boxes.  
  
5.  Click **Finish** to add the event to the project.
