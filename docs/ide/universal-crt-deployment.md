# Universal CRT deployment

From Visual Studio .NET through Visual Studio 2013, each major release of the C++ compiler and tools has included a new, standalone version of the Microsoft C Runtime (CRT) library. These standalone versions of the CRT were independent from, and to various degrees, incompatible with each other. For example, the CRT library used by Visual Studio 2012 was version 11, named msvcr110.dll, and the CRT used by Visual Studio 2013 was version 12, named msvcr120.dll. Beginning in Visual Studio 2015, this is no longer the case. Visual Studio 2015 and later versions of Visual Studio all use one Universal CRT.

The Universal CRT is a Microsoft Windows operating system component. It is included as part of the operating system in Windows 10 and is available for older operating systems, Windows Vista through Windows 8.1, by using Windows Update. In addition, local deployment of the Universal CRT is supported, with some restrictions.

## Central deployment

The preferred method to centrally install the Universal CRT is to use Microsoft Windows Update. The Universal CRT is a Recommended update for all supported Microsoft Windows operating systems, so by default, most machines install it as part of the regular update process. The initial release of the Universal CRT was [KB2999226](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2999226); a subsequent update with various bug fixes was made in [KB3118401](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3118401), and there have been additional updates with further bug fixes and new features. For more recent updates, search [support.microsoft.com](https://support.microsoft.com) for Universal C Runtime or Universal CRT.

Not all Microsoft Windows computers regularly install updates by use of Windows Update, and some may not install all Recommended updates. To support the use of applications built by using the Visual Studio 2015 and later C++ toolsets on those machines, there are Universal CRT redistributables available for offline distribution. Those redistributables may be downloaded from one of the KB links above. Please note that the Universal CRT redistributables require that the machine has been updated to the current service pack. So, for example, the redistributable for Windows 7 will only install onto Windows 7 SP1, not Windows 7 RTM.

Because the Universal CRT is a fundamental dependency of the C++ libraries, the Visual C++ redistributable (VCRedist) installs a base version of the Universal CRT on machines that do not have a version already installed, sufficient to satisfy the C++ library dependencies. If your application depends on a more recent version of the Universal CRT, you must install that more recent version explicitly. It is best to install this before installing the VCRedist, to avoid potential multiple required reboots.

## Local deployment

Local deployment of the Universal CRT is supported, but not recommended for both performance and security reasons.  The DLLs for local deployment are included as part of the Windows SDK, in the Windows Kits\\10\\Redist\\ucrt\\DLLs subdirectory, by computer architecture. The DLLs required include ucrtbase.dll and a set of APISet forwarder DLLs named api-ms-win-\*.dll. The set of DLLs required on each operating system varies, so it is highly recommended that you include all of the DLLs when you deploy locally.

There are two restrictions on local deployment to be aware of:

- On Windows 10, the Universal CRT in the system directory is always used, even if an application includes an application-local copy of the Universal CRT. This is true even if the local copy of the Universal CRT is newer. This is because the Universal CRT is a core operating system component on Windows 10.

- On versions of Windows before Windows 8, the Universal CRT cannot be packaged locally with a plugin that is located in a directory other than the directory that contains the main executable for your app. The APISet forwarder DLLs are unable to resolve the ucrtbase.dll successfully in this case. Some recommended alternative solutions include:

  - Statically link the Universal CRT,
  - Centrally deploy the Universal CRT, or
  - Place the Universal CRT files in the same directory as the app.

## Deployment on Microsoft Windows XP

Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017 continue to support development of software for use on Microsoft Windows XP. To support this, a version of the Universal CRT does work on Microsoft Windows XP. The Microsoft Windows XP operating system is no longer in mainstream or extended support, so central deployment of the Universal CRT onto Microsoft Windows XP is different from other operating systems.

When the Visual C++ redistributable is installed on Windows XP, it directly installs the Universal CRT and all of its dependencies into the system directory, without installing or depending on any Windows Update. The Redistributable merge modules, the Microsoft_VC*version*_CRT_\*.msm files, do the same.

Local deployment of the Universal CRT on Windows XP is the same as on other supported operating systems.
