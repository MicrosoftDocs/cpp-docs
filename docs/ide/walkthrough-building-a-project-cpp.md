# Walkthrough: Building a Project (C++)

In this walkthrough, you deliberately introduce a Visual C++ syntax error in your code to learn what a compilation error looks like and how to fix it. When you compile the project, an error message indicates what the problem is and where it occurred.

## Prerequisites

- This walkthrough assumes that you understand the fundamentals of the C++ language.

- It also assumes that you've completed the earlier related walkthroughs that are listed in [Using the Visual Studio IDE for C++ Desktop Development](../ide/using-the-visual-studio-ide-for-cpp-desktop-development.md).

### To fix compilation errors

1. In Game.cpp, delete the semicolon in the last line so that it resembles the statement:

   `return 0`

1. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution**.

1. A message in the **Error List** window indicates that there was an error in the building of the project. The description looks something like the error message:

   `error C2143: syntax error: missing ';' before '}'`

   To view help information about this error, highlight it in the **Error List** window and then choose the **F1** key.

1. Add the semicolon back to the end of the line that has the syntax error:

   `return 0;`

1. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Build Solution**.

   A message in the **Output** window indicates that the project compiled successfully.

    ```Output
    1>------ Build started: Project: Game, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------
    1>Game.cpp
    1>Game.vcxproj -> C:\Users\<username>\source\repos\Game\Debug\Game.exe
    ========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========
    ```
