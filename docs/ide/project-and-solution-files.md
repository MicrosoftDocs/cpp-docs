# Project and Solution Files
The following files are created when you create a project in Visual Studio. They are used to manage project files in the solution.  
  
|Filename|Directory location|Solution Explorer location|Description|  
|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|  
|*Solname*.sln|*Projname*|Not displayed in Solution Explorer|The *solution* file. It organizes all elements of a project or multiple projects into one solution.|  
|*Projname*.suo|*Projname*|Not displayed in Solution Explorer|The *solution options* file. It stores your customizations for the solution so that every time you open a project or file in the solution, it has the appearance and behavior you want.|  
|*Projname*.vcxproj|*Projname*|Not displayed in Solution Explorer|The *project* file. It stores information specific to each project. (In earlier versions, this file was named *Projname*.vcproj or *Projname*.dsp.) For an example of a Visual C++ project file, see [Project Files](../ide/project-files.md).|  
|*Projname*.vcxitems|*Projname*|Not displayed in Solution Explorer|The *Shared Items project* file. This project isn't built.  Instead, the project can be referenced by another C++ project, and its files will become part of the referencing project's build process. This can be used to share common code with cross-platform C++ projects.|
|*Projname*.sdf|*Projname*|Not displayed in Solution Explorer|The *browsing database* file. It supports browsing and navigation features such as **Goto Definition**, **Find All References**, and **Class View**. It is generated by parsing the header files.|  
|*Projname.*vcxproj.filters|*Projname*|Not displayed in Solution Explorer|The *filters* file. It specifies where to put a file that is added to the solution. For example, a .h file is put in the **Header Files** node.|  
|*Projname.*vcxproj.user|*Projname*|Not displayed in Solution Explorer|The *migration user* file. After a project is migrated from Visual Studio 2008, this file contains information that was converted from any .vsprops file.|  
|*Projname*.idl|*Projname*|Source|(Project-specific) Contains the Interface Description Language (IDL) source code for a control type library. This file is used by Visual C++ to generate a type library. The generated library exposes the interface of the control to other Automation clients. For more information, see [Interface Definition (IDL) File](/windows/desktop/Rpc/the-interface-definition-language-idl-file) in the Windows SDK.|  
|Readme.txt|*Projname*|Project|The *read me* file. It is generated by the application wizard and describes the files in a project.|
