# Create a New Linux Project
When coding C++ in Visual Studio for Linux, you have the choice of creating a Visual Studio project, or a CMake project. This topic describes how to create a Visual Studio project. For information about CMake Projects, see [Configure a Linux CMake Project ](cmake-linux-project.md).

To create a new Linux project in Visual Studio, do the following:

1. Select **File > New Project** in Visual Studio, or press **Ctrl + Shift + N**.
1. Select the **Visual C++ > Cross Platform > Linux** node and then select the project type you would like to create, enter a Name/Location, and click OK.
