# Makefile Project Properties (Linux C++)

This is a partial list of the properties available in a Linux Makefile project. Many Makefile project properties are identical to the Linux C++ Console Application project properties.

## General

Property | Description | Choices
--- | ---| ---
Output Directory | Specifies a relative path to the output file directory; can include environment variables.
Intermediate Directory | Specifies a relative path to the intermediate file directory; can include environment variables.
Build Log File | Specifies the build log file to write to when build logging is enabled.
Configuration Type | Specifies the type of output this configuration generates. | **Dynamic Library (.so)** - Dynamic Library (.so)<br>**Static library (.a)** - Static Library (.a)<br>**Application (.out)** - Application (.out)<br>**Makefile** - Makefile<br>
Remote Build Machine | The target machine or device to use for remote build, deploy and debug.
Remote Build Root Directory | Specifies a path to a directory on the remote machine or device.
Remote Build Project Directory | Specifies a path to a directory on the remote machine or device for the project.

## Debugging

See [Debugger Properties (Linux C++)](debugging-linux.md)

## Copy Sources

See [Copy Sources Project Properties (Linux C++)](copy-sources-project.md).

## Build Events

### Pre-Build Event

Property | Description
--- | ---
Command Line | Specifies a command line for the pre-build event tool to run.
Description | Specifies a description for the pre-build event tool to display.
Use In Build | Specifies whether this build event is excluded from the build for the current configuration.
Additional files to copy | Specifies additional files to copy to the remote system. Optionally the list can be provided as a local to remote mapping pairs using a syntax like this: fulllocalpath1:=fullremotepath1;fulllocalpath2:=fullremotepath2, where a local file can be copied to the specified remote location on the remote system.

### Post-Build Event

Property | Description
--- | ---
Command Line | Specifies a command line for the post-build event tool to run.
Description | Specifies a description for the post-build event tool to display.
Use In Build | Specifies whether this build event is excluded from the build for the current configuration.
Additional files to copy | Specifies additional files to copy to the remote system. Optionally the list can be provided as a local to remote mapping pairs using a syntax like this: fulllocalpath1:=fullremotepath1;fulllocalpath2:=fullremotepath2, where a local file can be copied to the specified remote location on the remote system.

### Remote Pre-Build Event

Property | Description
--- | ---
Command Line | Specifies a command line for the pre-build event tool to run on the remote system.
Description | Specifies a description for the pre-build event tool to display.
Use In Build | Specifies whether this build event is excluded from the build for the current configuration.
Additional files to copy | Specifies additional files to copy from the remote system. Optionally the list can be provided as a remote to local mapping pairs using a syntax like this: fullremotepath1:=fulllocalpath1;fullremotepath2:=fulllocalpath2, where a remote file can be copied to the specified location on the local machine.

### Remote Post-Build Event

Property | Description
--- | ---
Command Line | Specifies a command line for the post-build event tool to run on the remote system.
Description | Specifies a description for the post-build event tool to display.
Use In Build | Specifies whether this build event is excluded from the build for the current configuration.
Additional files to copy | Specifies additional files to copy from the remote system. Optionally the list can be provided as a remote to local mapping pairs using a syntax like this: fullremotepath1:=fulllocalpath1;fullremotepath2:=fulllocalpath2, where a remote file can be copied to the specified location on the local machine.

## C/C++

### IntelliSense

The IntelliSense properties can be set at the project or file level to provide clues to the IntelliSense engine. They do not affect compilation.

Property | Description
--- | ---
Include Search Path | Specifies the include search path for resolving included files.
Forced Includes | Specifies the files that are forced included.
Preprocessor Definitions | Specifies the preprocessor defines used by the source files.
Undefine Preprocessor Definitions | Specifies one or more preprocessor undefines.     (/U[macro])
Additional Options | Specifies additional compiler switches to be used by IntelliSense when parsing C++ files.

### Build

Property | Description
--- | ---
Build Command Line | Specifies the command line to run for the 'Build' command.
Rebuild All Command Line | Specifies the command line to run for the 'Rebuild All' command.
Clean Command Line | Specifies the command line to run for the 'Clean' command.

### Remote Build

Property | Description
--- | ---
Build Command Line | Specifies the command line to run for the 'Build' command. This is executed on the remote system.
Rebuild All Command Line | Specifies the command line to run for the 'Rebuild All' command. This is executed on the remote system.
Clean Command Line | Specifies the command line to run for the 'Clean' command. This is executed on the remote system.
Outputs | Specifies the outputs generated by the remote build on the remote system.
