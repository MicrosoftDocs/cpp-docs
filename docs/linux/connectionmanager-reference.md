ConnectionManager.exe is a command-line utility to manage remote development connections outside of Visual Studio. It's useful for tasks such as provisioning a new development machine. Or, use it to set up Visual Studio for continuous integration.Â You can use it in a Developer Command Prompt window. For more information about the Developer Command Prompt, see [Use the Microsoft C++ toolset from the command line](../build/building-on-the-command-line.md).

`ConnectionManager.exe` is available in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.5 and later. It's part of the **Linux development with C++** workload in the Visual Studio Installer. It's also installed automatically when you choose the **Connection Manager** component in the installer. It's installed in `%VCIDEInstallDir%\Linux\bin\ConnectionManagerExe\ConnectionManager.exe`.

The functionality of `ConnectionManager.exe` is also available in Visual Studio. To manage remote development connections in the IDE, on the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Options** to open the Options dialog. In the Options dialog, select **Cross Platform** > **Connection Manager**.

## Syntax

> **`ConnectionManager.exe`** *command* \[*arguments*] \[*options*]

### Commands and arguments

- **`add`** *user\@host* \[**`--port`** *port*] \[**`--password`** *password*] \[**`--privatekey`** *privatekey_file*]

  Authenticates and adds a new connection. By default, it uses port 22 and password authentication. (You are prompted to enter a password.)

  You can use either a password or a key file and passphrase for authentication. Key files are more secure than username/password. If you already have a key pair, it's possible to reuse it. Use both **-`-password`** and **`--privatekey`** to specify a passphrase for a private key file.

  Versions of Visual Studio before 17.10 support Elliptic Curve (EC), Rivert-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), and Digital signature algorithm (DSA) keys for remote connections. Because of security concerns, RSA and DSA keys are no longer supported in VS 17.10 and later. Only EC keys are currently supported.

  To create a key pair compatible with the connection manager, use the command `ssh-keygen -m pem -t ecdsa -f <key-name>`. If you use `ssh-keygen` to create the private key, you must specify the switch `-m pem`, or the key won't be accepted by Visual Studio. If your private key begins with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`, you must convert it with `ssh-keygen -p -f <FILE> -m pem`.

- **`clean`**

  Deletes header cache for connections that no longer exist.

- **`help`**

  Displays a help screen.

- **`list`** \[**`--properties`**]

  Displays information, IDs, and properties of all stored connections.<br>For examples, see [Commonly used properties](#commonly-used-properties).

- **`modify`** \[*default* \| *connection_id* \| *user\@host* \[**`--port`** *port*]] \[**`--property`** *key=value*]

  Defines or modifies a property on a connection.\
  If *value* is empty, then the property *key* is deleted.\
  If authentication fails, no changes will be made.\
  If no connection is specified, the user's default remote connection is used.

- **`remove`** \[*connection_id* \| *user\@host* \[**`--port`** *port*]]

  Removes a connection. If no arguments are specified, you're prompted to specify which connection to remove.

- **`remove-all`**

  Removes all stored connections.

- **`update`** \[*default* \| *all* \| *connection_id* \| *user\@host* \[**`--port`** *port*]] \[**`--previous`**] [**`--fingerprint`**]

  Added in Visual Studio 16.10. Updates the host key fingerprint of the specified connection(s).

- **`version`**

  Displays version information.

### Options

- **`--file`** *filename*

  Read connection information from the provided *filename*.

- **`--fingerprint`**

  The host key fingerprint presented by the server. Use this option with **`list`** to view a connection's fingerprint.

- **`-i`**

  Same as **`--privatekey`**.

- **`-n`**, **`--dry-run`**

  Does a dry run of the command.

- **`--no-prompt`**

  Fail instead of prompt, when appropriate.

- **`--no-telemetry`**

  Disable sending usage data back to Microsoft. Usage data is collected and sent back to Microsoft unless the **`--no-telemetry`** flag is passed.  

- **`--no-verify`**

  Add or modify a connection without authentication.

- **`--p`**

  Same as **`--password`**.
  
- **`--previous`**

  Indicates that the connection(s) will be read from the previous version of connection manager, updated, and written to the new version.
  
- **`-q`**, **`--quiet`**

  Prevents output to `stdout` or `stderr`.

## Examples

This command adds a connection for a user named "user" on localhost. The connection uses a key file for authentication, found in *%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa*.

```cmd
ConnectionManager.exe add user@127.0.0.1 --privatekey "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa"
```

This command removes the connection that has ID 1975957870 from the list of connections.

```cmd
ConnectionManager.exe remove 1975957870
```

### Commonly used properties

| Property | Description |
|--|--|
| authentication type | The type of authentication used for the connection such as: `"password"`, `"privatekey"`.<br/>To create a connection with the authentication type set to `"privatekey"`: `ConnectionManager.exe add user@127.0.0.1 --privatekey "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa"`|
| `default` | A boolean indicating whether this is the default connection. The default connection is used when there's more than one connection available and the one to use isn't specified.<br/>To set the specified connection to be the default connection: `ConnectionManager.exe modify -21212121 --property default=true` |
| `host` | The name or IP address of the remote computer.<br/>To change the host for the specified connection to another machine, in this case, local host: `ConnectionManager.exe modify -21212121 --property host=127.0.0.1` |
| `isWsl` | Returns true if the remote session is running Windows Subsystem for Linux. |
| `password` | The password for the connection. Change the password for the specified connection with: `ConnectionManager.exe modify -21212121 --property password="xyz"`|
| `platform` | The platform of the remote computer such as `"ARM"`, `"ARM64"`, `"PPC"`, `"PPC64"`, `"x64"`, `"x86"`.|
| `port` | The port used for the connection.<br/>Change the port for the specified connection: `ConnectionManager.exe modify -21212121 --property port=22`|
| `shell` | The preferred shell to use on the remote system. Supported shells are `sh, csh, bash, tcsh, ksh, zsh, dash`<br/>To set the preferred shell to be zsh for the remote machine on the specified connection: `ConnectionManager.exe modify -21212121 --property shell=zsh`<br/>If the shell found on the Linux system isn't supported, then **`sh`** is used for all commands. |
| `systemID` | The remote system type, such as `"OSX"`, `"Ubuntu"`. |
| `timeout` | The connection timeout in milliseconds. Change the timeout for the specified connection with: `ConnectionManager.exe modify -21212121 --property timeout=100` |
| `username` | The name of the user logged into the remote computer.<br/>To add a connection for a user named `"user"` on localhost: `ConnectionManager.exe add user@127.0.0.1`|
