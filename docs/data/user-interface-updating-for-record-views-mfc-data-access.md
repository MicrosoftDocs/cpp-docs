# User-Interface Updating for Record Views  (MFC Data Access)

`CRecordView` provides default user-interface update handlers for the navigation commands. These handlers automate enabling and disabling the user-interface objects â€” menu items and toolbar buttons. The application wizard supplies standard menus and, if you choose the **Dockable Toolbar** option, a set of toolbar buttons for the commands. If you create a record view class using `CRecordView`, you might want to add similar user-interface objects to your application.

### To create menu resources with the menu editor

1. Referring to the information about using the [menu editor](../windows/menu-editor.md), create your own menu with the same four commands.

#### To create toolbar buttons with the graphics editor

1. Referring to the information about using the [toolbar editor](../windows/toolbar-editor.md), edit the toolbar resource to add toolbar buttons for your record navigation commands.
