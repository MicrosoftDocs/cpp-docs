# Record (MFC Data Access)

A record is a collection of data about a single entity, such as an account or a customer, stored in a table (a row of the table). A record consists of a group of contiguous columns (sometimes called fields) that contain data of various types. A set of records selected from a data source — often called a result set in database terms — is called a recordset in MFC. For more information, see [Recordset (ODBC)](../data/odbc/recordset-odbc.md).
