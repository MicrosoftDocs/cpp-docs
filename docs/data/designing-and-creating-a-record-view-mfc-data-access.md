# Designing and Creating a Record View  (MFC Data Access)

You can create your record view class with the [MFC Application Wizard](../mfc/reference/database-support-mfc-application-wizard.md). If you use an application wizard, it creates the record view class and a dialog template resource for it (without controls). You must use the Visual C++ Dialog editor to add controls to the dialog template resource. On the other hand, if you use **Add Class**, you must first create the dialog template resource in the Dialog editor and then create the record view class.

#### To create your record view with the MFC Application Wizard

1. See [Database Support, MFC Application Wizard](../mfc/reference/database-support-mfc-application-wizard.md).

#### To design your form

1. See [Dialog Editor](../windows/dialog-editor.md).

#### To create your record view class

1. See [Adding an MFC ODBC Consumer](../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-odbc-consumer.md).

The following topics explain additional details of using record views:
