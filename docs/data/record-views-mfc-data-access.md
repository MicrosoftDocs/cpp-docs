# Record Views  (MFC Data Access)
This section applies only to the MFC ODBC classes. For information about OLE DB record views, see [COleDBRecordView](../mfc/reference/coledbrecordview-class.md) and [Using OLE DB Record Views](../data/oledb/using-ole-db-record-views.md).  
  
 To support form-based data-access applications, the class library provides class [CRecordView](../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md). A record view is a form view object whose controls are mapped directly to the field data members of a [recordset](../data/odbc/recordset-odbc.md) object (and indirectly to the corresponding columns in a query result or table on the data source). Like its base class [CFormView](../mfc/reference/cformview-class.md), `CRecordView` is based on a dialog template resource.  
  
## Form Uses  
 Forms are useful for a variety of data-access tasks:  
  
-   Entering data  
  
-   Performing read-only examination of data  
  
-   Updating data  
  
## Further Reading About Record Views  
 The material in topics applies to both the ODBC-based and the DAO-based classes. Use `CRecordView` for ODBC and `CDaoRecordView` for DAO.
