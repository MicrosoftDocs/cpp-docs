# MFC Database Classes

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft recommends using ODBC via Microsoft ODBC Driver 13 (or later) for SQL Server for new projects. DAO is no longer supported.

For more information, see the following topics:

- [Driver history for Microsoft SQL Server](/sql/connect/connect-history)

- [ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server released](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dataplatforminsider/2016/08/03/odbc-driver-13-1-for-sql-server-released/) Microsoft ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server should be used to create new applications or enhance existing applications that need to take advantage of new SQL Server 2016 features.
