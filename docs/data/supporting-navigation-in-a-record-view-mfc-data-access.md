# Supporting Navigation in a Record View  (MFC Data Access)
This topic explains how to support movement from record to record in your [CRecordView](../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) class, including information about:  
  
-   [Command handling](../data/command-handlers-for-record-scrolling-mfc-data-access.md) for record scrolling commands.  
  
-   [User-interface update handlers for scrolling](../data/user-interface-updating-for-record-views-mfc-data-access.md) commands.
