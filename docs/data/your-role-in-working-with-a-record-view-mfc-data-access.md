# Your Role in Working with a Record View  (MFC Data Access)

The following table shows what you typically must do to work with a record view and what the framework does for you.

### Working with a Record View: You and the Framework

|You|The framework|
|---------|-------------------|
|Use the Visual C++ Dialog editor to design the form.|Creates a dialog template resource with controls.|
|Use the [MFC Application Wizard](../mfc/reference/database-support-mfc-application-wizard.md) to create classes derived from [CRecordView](../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) and [CRecordset](../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md).|Writes the classes for you.|
|Map record view controls to recordset field data members.|Provides DDX between the controls and the recordset fields.|
||Provides default command handlers for **Move First**, **Move Last**, **Move Next**, and **Move Previous** commands from menus or toolbar buttons.|
||Updates changes to the data source.|
|[Optional] Write code to fill list boxes or combo boxes or other controls with data from a second recordset.||
|[Optional] Write code for any special validations.||
|[Optional] Write code to add or delete records.||

Form-based programming is only one approach to working with a database. For information about applications using some other user interface, or no user interface, see [MFC: Using Database Classes with Documents and Views](../data/mfc-using-database-classes-with-documents-and-views.md) and [MFC: Using Database Classes Without Documents and Views](../data/mfc-using-database-classes-without-documents-and-views.md). For alternative approaches to displaying database records, see classes [CListView](../mfc/reference/clistview-class.md) and [CTreeView](../mfc/reference/ctreeview-class.md).
