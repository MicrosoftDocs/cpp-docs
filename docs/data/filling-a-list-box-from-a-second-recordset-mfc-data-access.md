# Filling a List Box from a Second Recordset  (MFC Data Access)
By default, a record view is associated with a single recordset object, whose fields are mapped to the record view's controls. Sometimes you might want to put a list box or combo box control in your record view and fill it with values from a second recordset object. The user can use the list box to select a new category of information to display in the record view. This topic explains how and when to do that.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Be aware that filling a combo box or list box from a data source might be slow. Take precautions against trying to fill a control from a recordset with a large number of records.  
  
 The model for this topic consists of a primary recordset that fills the controls of your form, while a secondary recordset fills a list box or combo box. Selecting a string from the list box causes your program to requery the primary recordset based on what was selected. The following procedure uses a combo box but applies equally to a list box.  
  
#### To fill a combo box or list box from a second recordset  
  
1.  Create the recordset object ([CRecordset](../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md).  
  
2.  Obtain a pointer to the [CComboBox](../mfc/reference/ccombobox-class.md) object for the combo box control.  
  
3.  Empty the combo box of any previous contents.  
  
4.  Move through all records in the recordset, calling [CComboBox::AddString](../mfc/reference/ccombobox-class.md#addstring) for each string from the current record you want to add to the combo box.  
  
5.  Initialize the selection in the combo box.  
  
```cpp  
void CSectionForm::OnInitialUpdate()  
{  
    // ...  
  
    // Fill the combo box with all of the courses  
    CENROLLDoc* pDoc = GetDocument();  
    if (!pDoc->m_courseSet.Open())  
        return;  
  
    // ...  
  
    m_ctlCourseList.ResetContent();  
    if (pDoc->m_courseSet.IsOpen())  
    {   
        while (!pDoc->m_courseSet.IsEOF() )  
        {  
            m_ctlCourseList.AddString(  
                pDoc->m_courseSet.m_CourseID);  
            pDoc->m_courseSet.MoveNext();  
        }  
    }  
    m_ctlCourseList.SetCurSel(0);  
}  
```  
  
 This function uses a second recordset, `m_courseSet`, which contains a record for each course offered, and a `CComboBox` control, `m_ctlCourseList`, which is stored in the record view class.  
  
 The function gets `m_courseSet` from the document and opens it. Then it empties `m_ctlCourseList` and scrolls through `m_courseSet`. For each record, the function calls the combo box's `AddString` member function to add the course ID value from the record. Finally, the code sets the combo box's selection.
