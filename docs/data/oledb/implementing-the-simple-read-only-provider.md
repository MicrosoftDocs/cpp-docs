# Implementing the Simple Read-Only Provider

The extended example in this topic shows how to edit the wizard-created files to create a simple read-only provider that reads a set of two strings from a text file. To create this provider from the wizard files, add code to complete the following tasks:

- [Read the strings into the provider](../../data/oledb/reading-strings-into-the-ole-db-provider.md)

- [Store the strings in the provider](../../data/oledb/storing-strings-in-the-ole-db-provider.md)
