# Using OLE DB Record Views

If you want to display OLE DB rowset data in an MFC application, use the MFC class [COleDBRecordView](../../mfc/reference/coledbrecordview-class.md). A record view object created from `COleDBRecordView` allows you to display database records in MFC controls. The record view is a dialog form view directly connected to an OLE DB Rowset object created from the `CRowset` template class. Getting a handle to the rowset object is simple:

```cpp
COleDBRecordView myRecordView;
...
// CProductAccessor is a user record class
CRowset<CAccessor<CProductAccessor>> myRowSet = myRecordView.OnGetRowset();
```

The view displays the fields of the `CRowset` object in the dialog's controls. The `COleDBRecordView` object uses Dialog Data Exchange (DDX) and the navigational functionality built into `CRowset` (`MoveFirst`, `MoveNext`, `MovePrev`, and `MoveLast`) to automate the movement of data between the controls on the form and the fields of the rowset. `COleDBRecordView` keeps track of the user's position in the rowset so that the record view can update the user interface and supplies an [OnMove](../../mfc/reference/coledbrecordview-class.md#onmove) method for updating the current record before moving to another.

You can use DDX functions with `COleDbRecordView` to get data directly from the database recordset and display it in a dialog control. Use the **DDX_**<strong>\*</strong> methods (such as `DDX_Text`), not the **DDX_Field**<strong>\*</strong> functions (such as `DDX_FieldText`) with `COleDbRecordView`.
