# Data Sources and Sessions
The following figure shows the classes that support connecting to and accessing a data source. Each class is based on a standard OLE DB component implementation.

Data Source and Session Classes  
  
 The classes are:  
  
-   [CDataSource](../../data/oledb/cdatasource-class.md) This class instantiates the data source object, which creates and manages a connection to a data source through an OLE DB provider. The data source takes information such as the data source address and authentication information in the form of a connection string.  
  
     It is also worth noting that the helper class [CEnumerator](../../data/oledb/cenumerator-class.md) is often used before any connection is established to obtain a list of available providers registered on a system. This allows you to select a provider as a data source. For example, the **Data Link Properties** dialog box uses this class to populate the list of providers on the **Providers** tab. It is equivalent to the `SQLBrowseConnect` or `SQLDriverConnect` function.  
  
-   [CSession](../../data/oledb/csession-class.md) This class instantiates the session object, which represents a single access session to the data source. However, you can create multiple sessions on a data source. For each session, you can create rowsets, commands, and other objects to access data from the data source. The session handles transactions.
