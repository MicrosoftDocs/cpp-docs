# Enabling and Disabling Services for a Provider

Individual OLE DB services can be enabled or disabled by default for all applications that access a single provider. This is done by adding an OLEDB_SERVICES registry entry under the provider's CLSID, with a DWORD value specifying the services to enable or disable, as shown in the following table.

|Default services enabled|Keyword value|
|------------------------------|-------------------|
|All services (default)|0xffffffff|
|All except Pooling and AutoEnlistment|0xfffffffe|
|All except Client Cursor|0xfffffffb|
|All except Pooling, AutoEnlistment, and Client Cursor|0xfffffff0|
|No services|0x00000000|
|No aggregation, all services disabled|\<missing key>|
