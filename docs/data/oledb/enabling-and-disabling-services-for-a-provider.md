# Enabling and Disabling Services for a Provider
Individual OLE DB services can be enabled or disabled by default for all applications that access a single provider. This is done by adding an OLEDB_SERVICES registry entry under the provider's CLSID, with a `DWORD` value specifying the services to enable or disable, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Default services enabled|Keyword value|  
|------------------------------|-------------------|  
|All services (default)|0xffffffff|  
|All except Pooling and AutoEnlistment|0xfffffffe|  
|All except Client Cursor|0xfffffffb|  
|All except Pooling, AutoEnlistment, and Client Cursor|0xfffffff0|  
|No services|0x00000000|  
|No aggregation, all services disabled|\<missing key>|
