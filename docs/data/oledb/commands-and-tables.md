# Commands and Tables

Commands and tables allow you to access rowsets; that is, open rowsets, execute commands, and bind columns. The [CCommand](../../data/oledb/ccommand-class.md) and [CTable](../../data/oledb/ctable-class.md) classes instantiate the command and table objects, respectively. These classes derive from [CAccessorRowset](../../data/oledb/caccessorrowset-class.md) as shown in the following figure.

Command and Table Classes

In the previous table, `TAccessor` can be any accessor type listed in [Accessor Types](../../data/oledb/accessors-and-rowsets.md). `TRowset` can be any rowset type listed in [Rowset Types](../../data/oledb/accessors-and-rowsets.md). `TMultiple` specifies the result type (a single or multiple result set).

The [ATL OLE DB Consumer Wizard](../../atl/reference/atl-ole-db-consumer-wizard.md) lets you specify whether you want a command or table object.

- For data sources without commands, you can use the `CTable` class. You generally use it for simple rowsets that specify no parameters and require no multiple results. This simple class opens a table on a data source using a table name that you specify.

- For data sources that support commands, you can use the `CCommand` class instead. To execute a command, call [Open](../../data/oledb/ccommand-open.md) on this class. As an alternative, you can call `Prepare` to prepare a command that you want to execute more than once.

   `CCommand` has three template arguments: an accessor type, a rowset type, and a result type (`CNoMultipleResults`, by default, or `CMultipleResults`). If you specify `CMultipleResults`, the `CCommand` class supports the `IMultipleResults` interface and handles multiple rowsets. The [DBVIEWER](https://github.com/Microsoft/VCSamples) sample shows how to handle the multiple results.
