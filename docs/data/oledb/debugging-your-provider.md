# Debugging Your Provider

There are two ways to debug your provider:

- Because providers are created in process, you can create some consumer code using the OLE DB consumer templates and step into the provider normally.

- You can use various utilities that come with Visual C++.

## To use debugging

1. Open the provider project.

1. On the **Projects** menu, click **Properties**.

1. In the **Property Pages** dialog box, click the **Debugging** tab.

1. Select options as required, click **OK**.

1. Set breakpoints, and then debug as usual.
