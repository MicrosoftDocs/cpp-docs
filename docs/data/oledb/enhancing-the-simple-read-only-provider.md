# Enhancing the Simple Read-Only Provider

This section shows how to enhance the [simple read-only provider](../../data/oledb/implementing-the-simple-read-only-provider.md) created in the previous section. `IRowsetLocateImpl` creates an implementation for the `IRowsetLocate` interface and adds bookmark support for you.

When you have a working provider, you might want to enhance it to make the provider update, handle transactions, or enhance the performance of the row-fetching algorithm. Most provider enhancements involve adding an interface to an existing COM object.

The example in the following topics enhances the row-fetching mechanism by adding the `IRowsetLocate` interface to `CAgentRowset`. The topics show you how to:

- [Make RCustomRowset inherit from IRowsetLocate](../../data/oledb/modifying-the-inheritance-of-rmyproviderrowset.md).

- [Dynamically determine the columns returned to the consumer](../../data/oledb/dynamically-determining-columns-returned-to-the-consumer.md).
