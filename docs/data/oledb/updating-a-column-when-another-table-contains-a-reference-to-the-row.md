# Updating a Column When Another Table Contains a Reference to the Row

Some providers can detect which columns in the row change, but many providers can't. As a result, updating a column can result in an error when there's a reference to the row you're trying to update. To solve this problem, create a separate accessor holding only the columns you want to change. Pass the number of that accessor to `SetData`.
