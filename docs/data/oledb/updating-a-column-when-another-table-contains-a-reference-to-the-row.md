# Updating a Column When Another Table Contains a Reference to the Row
Some providers can detect which columns in the row change, but many providers cannot. As a result, updating a column can result in an error when there is a reference to the row you are attempting to update. To solve this problem, create a separate accessor containing only the columns you want to change. Pass the number of that accessor to `SetData`.
