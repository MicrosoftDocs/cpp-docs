# Data Source: Programmatically Creating a Table in an ODBC Data Source

This topic explains how to create a table for your data source, using the `ExecuteSQL` member function of class `CDatabase`, passing the function a string that contains a **CREATE TABLE** SQL statement.

For general information about ODBC data sources in MFC, see [Data Source (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/data-source-odbc.md). The topic [Data Source: Programmatically Configuring an ODBC Data Source](../../data/odbc/data-source-programmatically-configuring-an-odbc-data-source.md) describes creating data sources.

When you have the data source established, you can easily create tables using the `ExecuteSQL` member function and the **CREATE TABLE** SQL statement. For example, if you had a `CDatabase` object called `myDB`, you could use the following MFC code to create a table:

```
myDB.ExecuteSQL("CREATE TABLE OFFICES (OfficeID TEXT(4)" ",
                         OfficeName TEXT(10))");
```

This code example creates a table called "OFFICES" in the Microsoft Access data source connection maintained by `myDB`; the table contains two fields "OfficeID" and "OfficeName."

> [!NOTE]
>  The field types specified in the **CREATE TABLE** SQL statement might vary according to the ODBC driver that you are using. The Microsoft Query program (distributed with Visual C++ 1.5) is one way to discover what field types are available for a data source. In Microsoft Query, click **File**, click **Table_Definition**, select a table from a data source, and look at the type shown in the **Type** combo box. SQL syntax also exists to create indexes.
