# Recordset: Locking Records (ODBC)

This topic applies to the MFC ODBC classes.

This topic explains:

- [The kinds of record locking available](#_core_record.2d.locking_modes).

- [How to lock records in your recordset during updates](#_core_locking_records_in_your_recordset).

When you use a recordset to update a record on the data source, your application can lock the record so no other user can update the record at the same time. The state of a record updated by two users at the same time is undefined unless the system can guarantee that two users cannot update a record simultaneously.

> [!NOTE]
>  This topic applies to objects derived from `CRecordset` in which bulk row fetching has not been implemented. If you have implemented bulk row fetching, some of the information does not apply. For example, you cannot call the `Edit` and `Update` member functions. For more information about bulk row fetching, see [Recordset: Fetching Records in Bulk (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-fetching-records-in-bulk-odbc.md).

##  <a name="_core_record.2d.locking_modes"></a> Record-Locking Modes

The database classes provide two [record-locking modes](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#setlockingmode):

- Optimistic locking (the default)

- Pessimistic locking

Updating a record occurs in three steps:

1. You begin the operation by calling the [Edit](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#edit) member function.

1. You change the appropriate fields of the current record.

1. You end the operation — and normally commit the update — by calling the [Update](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#update) member function.

Optimistic locking locks the record on the data source only during the `Update` call. If you use optimistic locking in a multiuser environment, the application should handle an `Update` failure condition. Pessimistic locking locks the record as soon as you call `Edit` and does not release it until you call `Update` (failures are indicated through the `CDBException` mechanism, not by a value of FALSE returned by `Update`). Pessimistic locking has a potential performance penalty for other users, because concurrent access to the same record might have to wait until completion of your application's `Update` process.

##  <a name="_core_locking_records_in_your_recordset"></a> Locking Records in Your Recordset

If you want to change a recordset object's [locking mode](#_core_record.2d.locking_modes) from the default, you must change the mode before you call `Edit`.

#### To change the current locking mode for your recordset

1. Call the [SetLockingMode](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#setlockingmode) member function, specifying either `CRecordset::pessimistic` or `CRecordset::optimistic`.

The new locking mode remains in effect until you change it again or the recordset is closed.

> [!NOTE]
>  Relatively few ODBC drivers currently support pessimistic locking.
