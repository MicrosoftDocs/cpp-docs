# Recordset: How Recordsets Update Records (ODBC)
This topic applies to the MFC ODBC classes.  
  
 Besides their ability to select records from a data source, recordsets can (optionally) update or delete the selected records or add new records. Three factors determine a recordset's updateability: whether the connected data source is updateable, the options you specify when you create a recordset object, and the SQL that is created.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The SQL on which your `CRecordset` object is based can affect your recordset's updateability. For example, if your SQL contains a join or a **GROUP BY** clause, MFC sets the updateability to FALSE.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This topic applies to objects derived from `CRecordset` in which bulk row fetching has not been implemented. If you are using bulk row fetching, see [Recordset: Fetching Records in Bulk (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-fetching-records-in-bulk-odbc.md).  
  
 This topic explains:  
  
-   [Your role in recordset updating](#_core_your_role_in_recordset_updating) and what the framework does for you.  
  
-   [The recordset as an edit buffer](#_core_the_edit_buffer) and the [differences between dynasets and snapshots](#_core_dynasets_and_snapshots).  
  
 [Recordset: How AddNew, Edit, and Delete Work (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-how-addnew-edit-and-delete-work-odbc.md) describes the actions of these functions from the point of view of the recordset.  
  
 [Recordset: More About Updates (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-more-about-updates-odbc.md) completes the recordset update story by explaining how transactions affect updates, how closing a recordset or scrolling affects updates in progress, and how your updates interact with the updates of other users.  
  
##  <a name="_core_your_role_in_recordset_updating"></a> Your Role in Recordset Updating  
 The following table shows your role in using recordsets to add, edit, or delete records, along with what the framework does for you.  
  
### Recordset Updating: You and the Framework  
  
|You|The framework|  
|---------|-------------------|  
|Determine whether the data source is updateable (or appendable).|Supplies [CDatabase](../../mfc/reference/cdatabase-class.md) member functions for testing the data source's updateability or appendability.|  
|Open an updatable recordset (of any type).||  
|Determine whether the recordset is updatable by calling `CRecordset` update functions such as `CanUpdate` or `CanAppend`.||  
|Call recordset member functions to add, edit, and delete records.|Manages the mechanics of exchanging data between your recordset object and the data source.|  
|Optionally, use transactions to control the update process.|Supplies `CDatabase` member functions to support transactions.|  
  
 For more information about transactions, see [Transaction (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/transaction-odbc.md).  
  
##  <a name="_core_the_edit_buffer"></a> The Edit Buffer  
 Taken collectively, the field data members of a recordset serve as an edit buffer that contains one record â€” the current record. Update operations use this buffer to operate on the current record.  
  
-   When you add a record, the edit buffer is used to build a new record. When you finish adding the record, the record that was previously current becomes current again.  
  
-   When you update (edit) a record, the edit buffer is used to set the field data members of the recordset to new values. When you finish updating, the updated record is still current.  
  
 When you call [AddNew](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#addnew) or [Edit](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#edit), the current record is stored so it can be restored later as needed. When you call [Delete](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#delete), the current record is not stored but is marked as deleted and you must scroll to another record.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The edit buffer plays no role in record deletion. When you delete the current record, the record is marked as deleted, and the recordset is "not on a record" until you scroll to a different record.  
  
##  <a name="_core_dynasets_and_snapshots"></a> Dynasets and Snapshots  
 [Dynasets](../../data/odbc/dynaset.md) refresh a record's contents as you scroll to the record. [Snapshots](../../data/odbc/snapshot.md) are static representations of the records, so a record's contents are not refreshed unless you call [Requery](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#requery). To use all the functionality of dynasets, you must be working with an ODBC driver that conforms to the correct level of ODBC API support. For more information, see [ODBC](../../data/odbc/odbc-basics.md) and [Dynaset](../../data/odbc/dynaset.md).
