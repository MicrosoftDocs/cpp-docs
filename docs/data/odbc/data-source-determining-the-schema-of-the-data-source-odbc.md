# Data Source: Determining the Schema of the Data Source (ODBC)

This topic applies to the MFC ODBC classes.

To set up data members in your `CRecordset` objects, you need to know the schema of the data source to which you are connecting. Determining the schema of a data source involves obtaining a list of the tables in the data source, a list of the columns in each table, the data type of each column, and the existence of any indexes.
