# Record Field Exchange (RFX)
The MFC ODBC database classes automate moving data between the data source and a [recordset](../../data/odbc/recordset-odbc.md) object. When you derive a class from [CRecordset](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md) and do not use bulk row fetching, data is transferred by the record field exchange (RFX) mechanism.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you have implemented bulk row fetching in a derived `CRecordset` class, the framework uses the bulk record field exchange (Bulk RFX) mechanism to transfer data. For more information, see [Recordset: Fetching Records in Bulk (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-fetching-records-in-bulk-odbc.md).  
  
 RFX is similar to dialog data exchange (DDX). Moving data between a data source and the field data members of a recordset requires multiple calls to the recordset's [DoFieldExchange](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#dofieldexchange) function and considerable interaction between the framework and [ODBC](../../data/odbc/odbc-basics.md). The RFX mechanism is type-safe and saves you the work of calling ODBC functions such as `::SQLBindCol`. For more information about DDX, see [Dialog Data Exchange and Validation](../../mfc/dialog-data-exchange-and-validation.md).  
  
 RFX is mostly transparent to you. If you declare your recordset classes with the MFC Application Wizard or **Add Class** (as described in [Adding an MFC ODBC Consumer](../../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-odbc-consumer.md)), RFX is built into them automatically. Your recordset class must be derived from the base class `CRecordset` supplied by the framework. The MFC Application Wizard lets you create an initial recordset class. **Add Class** lets you add other recordset classes as you need them. For more information and examples, see [Adding an MFC ODBC Consumer](../../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-odbc-consumer.md).  
  
 You must manually add a small amount of RFX code in three cases, when you want to:  
  
-   Use parameterized queries. For more information, see [Recordset: Parameterizing a Recordset (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-parameterizing-a-recordset-odbc.md).  
  
-   Perform joins (using one recordset for columns from two or more tables). For more information, see [Recordset: Performing a Join (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-performing-a-join-odbc.md).  
  
-   Bind data columns dynamically. This is less common than parameterization. For more information, see [Recordset: Dynamically Binding Data Columns (ODBC)](../../data/odbc/recordset-dynamically-binding-data-columns-odbc.md).  
  
 If you need a more advanced understanding of RFX, see [Record Field Exchange: How RFX Works](../../data/odbc/record-field-exchange-how-rfx-works.md).
