# ODBC Driver Requirements for Dynasets
In the MFC ODBC database classes, dynasets are recordsets with dynamic properties; they remain synchronized with the data source in certain ways. MFC dynasets (but not forward-only recordsets) require an ODBC driver with Level 2 API conformance. If the driver for your [data source](../../data/odbc/data-source-odbc.md) conforms to the Level 1 API set, you can still use both updateable and read-only snapshots and forward-only recordsets, but not dynasets. However, a Level 1 driver can support dynasets if it supports extended fetch and keyset-driven cursors.  
  
 In ODBC terminology, dynasets and snapshots are referred to as cursors. A cursor is a mechanism used for keeping track of its position in a recordset. For more information about driver requirements for dynasets, see [Dynaset](../../data/odbc/dynaset.md). For more information about cursors, see the [Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms710252\(v=vs.85\)) SDK in the MSDN documentation.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For updateable recordsets, your ODBC driver must support either positioned update statements or the `::SQLSetPos` ODBC API function. If both are supported, MFC uses `::SQLSetPos` for efficiency. Alternatively, for snapshots, you can use the cursor library, which provides the required support for updateable snapshots (static cursors and positioned update statements).
