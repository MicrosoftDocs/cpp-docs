# Recordset: Obtaining SUMs and Other Aggregate Results (ODBC)
This topic applies to the MFC ODBC classes.  
  
 This topic explains how to obtain aggregate results using the following [SQL](../../data/odbc/sql.md) keywords:  
  
-   **SUM** Calculates the total of the values in a column with a numeric data type.  
  
-   **MIN** Extracts the smallest value in a column with a numeric data type.  
  
-   **MAX** Extracts the largest value in a column with a numeric data type.  
  
-   **AVG** Calculates an average value of all the values in a column with a numeric data type.  
  
-   **COUNT** Counts the number of records in a column of any data type.  
  
 You use these SQL functions to obtain statistical information about the records in a data source rather than to extract records from the data source. The recordset that is created usually consists of a single record (if all columns are aggregates) that contains a value. (There might be more than one record if you used a **GROUP BY** clause.) This value is the result of the calculation or extraction performed by the SQL function.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  To add a SQL **GROUP BY** clause (and possibly a **HAVING** clause) to your SQL statement, append it to the end of `m_strFilter`. For example:  
  
```  
m_strFilter = "sales > 10 GROUP BY SALESPERSON_ID";  
```  
  
 You can limit the number of records you use to obtain aggregate results by filtering and sorting the columns.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Some aggregation operators return a different data type from the columns over which they are aggregating.  
  
-   **SUM** and **AVG** might return the next larger data type (for example, calling with `int` returns **LONG** or **double**).  
  
-   **COUNT** usually returns **LONG** regardless of target column type.  
  
-   **MAX** and **MIN** return the same data type as the columns they calculate.  
  
     For example, the **Add Class** wizard creates `long` `m_lSales` to accommodate a Sales column, but you need to replace this with a `double m_dblSumSales` data member to accommodate the aggregate result. See the following example.  
  
#### To obtain an aggregate result for a recordset  
  
1.  Create a recordset as described in [Adding an MFC ODBC Consumer](../../mfc/reference/adding-an-mfc-odbc-consumer.md) containing the columns from which you want to obtain aggregate results.  
  
2.  Modify the [DoFieldExchange](../../mfc/reference/crecordset-class.md#dofieldexchange) function for the recordset. Replace the string representing the column name (the second argument of the [RFX](../../data/odbc/record-field-exchange-using-rfx.md) function calls) with a string representing the aggregation function on the column. For example, replace:  
  
    ```  
    RFX_Long(pFX, "Sales", m_lSales);  
    ```  
  
     with:  
  
    ```  
    RFX_Double(pFX, "Sum(Sales)", m_dblSumSales)  
    ```  
  
3.  Open the recordset. The result of the aggregation operation is left in `m_dblSumSales`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The wizard actually assigns data member names without Hungarian prefixes. For example, the wizard would produce `m_Sales` for a Sales column, rather than the `m_lSales` name used earlier for illustration.  
  
 If you are using a [CRecordView](../../mfc/reference/crecordview-class.md) class to view the data, you have to change the DDX function call to display the new data member value; in this case, changing it from:  
  
```  
DDX_FieldText(pDX, IDC_SUMSALES, m_pSet->m_lSales, m_pSet);  
```  
  
 To:  
  
```  
DDX_FieldText(pDX, IDC_SUMSALES, m_pSet->m_dblSumSales, m_pSet);  
```
