# Hosting a Windows Form User Control in an MFC Dialog Box

MFC hosts a Windows Forms control as a special kind of ActiveX control and communicates with the control by using ActiveX interfaces, and properties and methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> class. We recommend that you use .NET Framework properties and methods to operate on the control.

> [!NOTE]
> In the current release, a `CDialogBar` object cannot host Windows Forms controls.
