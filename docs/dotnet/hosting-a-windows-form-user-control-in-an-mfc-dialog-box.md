# Hosting a Windows Form User Control in an MFC Dialog Box
MFC hosts a Windows Forms control as a special kind of ActiveX control and communicates with the control by using ActiveX interfaces, and properties and methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> class. We recommend that you use .NET Framework properties and methods to operate on the control.  
  
 For a sample application that shows Windows Forms used with MFC, see [MFC and Windows Forms Integration](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=987021bc-e575-4fe3-baa9-15aa50b0f599&displaylang=en).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In the current release, a `CDialogBar` object cannot host Windows Forms controls.
