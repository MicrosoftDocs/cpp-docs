# How to: Compile MFC and ATL Code By Using /clr
This topic discusses how to compile existing MFC and ATL programs to target the Common Language Runtime.  
  
### To compile an MFC executable or regular MFC DLL by using /clr  
  
1.  Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the **Project Properties** dialog box, expand the node next to **Configuration Properties** and select **General**. In the right pane, under **Project Defaults**, set **Common Language Runtime support** to **Common Language Runtime Support (/clr)**.  
  
     In the same pane, make sure that **Use of MFC** is set to **Use MFC in a Shared DLL**.  
  
3.  Under **Configuration Properties**, expand the node next to **C/C++** and select **General**. Make sure that **Debug Information Format** is set to **Program Database /Zi** (not **/ZI**).  
  
4.  Select the **Code Generation** node. Set **Enable Minimal Rebuild** to **No (/Gm-)**. Also set **Basic Runtime Checks** to **Default**.  
  
5.  Under **Configuration Properties**, select **C/C++** and then **Code Generation**. Make sure that **Runtime Library** is set to either **Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd)** or **Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)**.  
  
6.  In Stdafx.h, add the following line.  
  
    ```  
    #using <System.Windows.Forms.dll>  
    ```  
  
### To compile an MFC extension DLL by using /clr  
  
1.  Follow the steps in "To compile an MFC executable or regular MFC DLL by using /clr".  
  
2.  Under **Configuration Properties**, expand the node next to **C/C++** and select **Precompiled Headers**. Set **Create/Use Precompiled Header** to **Not using Precompiled Headers**.  
  
     As an alternative, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click Stdafx.cpp and then click **Properties**. Under **Configuration Properties**, expand the node next to **C/C++** and select **General**. Set **Compile with Common Language Runtime support** to **No Common Language Runtime support**.  
  
3.  For the file that contains DllMain and anything it calls, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the file and then click **Properties**. Under **Configuration Properties**, expand the node next to **C/C++** and select **General**. In the right pane, under **Project Defaults**, set **Compile with Common Language Runtime support** to **No Common Language Runtime support**.  
  
### To compile an ATL executable by using /clr  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the **Project Properties** dialog box, expand the node next to **Configuration Properties** and select **General**. In the right pane, under **Project Defaults**, set **Common Language Runtime support** to **Common Language Runtime Support (/clr)**.  
  
3.  Under **Configuration Properties**, expand the node next to **C/C++** and select **General**. Make sure that **Debug Information Format** is set to **Program Database /Zi** (not **/ZI**).  
  
4.  Select the **Code Generation** node. Set **Enable Minimal Rebuild** to **No (/Gm-)**. Also set **Basic Runtime Checks** to **Default**.  
  
5.  Under **Configuration Properties**, select **C/C++** and then **Code Generation**. Make sure that **Runtime Library** is set to either **Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd)** or **Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)**.  
  
6.  For every MIDL-generated file (C files), right-click the file in **Solution Explorer** and then click **Properties**. Under **Configuration Properties**, expand the node next to **C/C++** and select **General**. Set **Compile with Common Language Runtime support** to **No Common Language Runtime support**.  
  
### To compile an ATL DLL by using /clr  
  
1.  Follow the steps in the "To compile an ATL executable by using /clr" section.  
  
2.  Under **Configuration Properties**, expand the node next to **C/C++** and select **Precompiled Headers**. Set **Create/Use Precompiled Header** to **Not using Precompiled Headers**.  
  
     As an alternative, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click Stdafx.cpp and then click **Properties**. Under **Configuration Properties**, expand the node next to **C/C++** and select **General**. Set **Compile with Common Language Runtime support** to **No Common Language Runtime support**.  
  
3.  For the file that contains DllMain and anything it calls, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the file and then click **Properties**. Under **Configuration Properties**, expand the node next to **C/C++** and select **General**. In the right pane, under **Project Defaults**, set **Compile with Common Language Runtime support** to **No Common Language Runtime support**.
