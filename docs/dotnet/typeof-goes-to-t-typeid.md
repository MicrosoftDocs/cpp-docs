# typeof Goes to T::typeid
The `typeof` operator used in Managed Extensions for C++ has been supplanted by the `typeid` keyword in Visual C++.  
  
 In Managed Extensions, the `__typeof()` operator returns the associated `Type*` object when passed the name of a managed type. For example:  
  
```  
// Creates and initializes a new Array instance.  
Array* myIntArray =   
   Array::CreateInstance( __typeof(Int32), 5 );  
```  
  
 In the new syntax, `__typeof` has been replaced by an additional form of `typeid` that returns a `Type^` when a managed type is specified.  
  
```  
// Creates and initializes a new Array instance.  
Array^ myIntArray =   
   Array::CreateInstance( Int32::typeid, 5 );  
```
