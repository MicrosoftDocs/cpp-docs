# How to: Determine the User Interactive State (C++/CLI)
The following code example demonstrates how to determine whether code is being run in a user-interactive context. If <xref:System.Environment.UserInteractive%2A> is false, then the code is running as a service process or from inside a Web application, in which case you should not attempt to interact with the user.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// user_interactive.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
using namespace System;  
  
int main()   
{  
   if ( Environment::UserInteractive )  
      Console::WriteLine("User interactive");  
   else  
      Console::WriteLine("Noninteractive");  
   return 0;  
}  
```
