# marshal_context::~marshal_context
Destroys a `marshal_context` object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
~marshal_context();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Some data conversions require a marshal context. See [Overview of Marshaling in C++](../dotnet/overview-of-marshaling-in-cpp.md) for more information about which translations require a context and which marshaling file has to be included in your application.  
  
 Deleting a `marshal_context` object will invalidate the data converted by that context. If you want to preserve your data after a `marshal_context` object is destroyed, you must manually copy the data to a variable that will persist.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header file:** \<msclr\marshal.h>, \<msclr\marshal_windows.h>, \<msclr\marshal_cppstd.h>, or \<msclr\marshal_atl.h>  
  
 **Namespace:** msclr::interop
