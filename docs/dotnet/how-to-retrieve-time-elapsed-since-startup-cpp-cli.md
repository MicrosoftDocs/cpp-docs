# How to: Retrieve Time Elapsed Since Startup (C++/CLI)
The following code example demonstrates how to determine the tick count, or number of milliseconds that have elapsed since Windows was started. This value is stored in the <xref:System.Environment.TickCount%2A?displayProperty=fullName> member and, because it is a 32-bit value, resets to zero approximately every 24.9 days.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// startup_time.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
using namespace System;  
  
int main( )   
{  
   Int32 tc = Environment::TickCount;  
   Int32 seconds = tc / 1000;  
   Int32 minutes = seconds / 60;  
   float hours = static_cast<float>(minutes) / 60;  
   float days = hours / 24;  
  
   Console::WriteLine("Milliseconds since startup: {0}", tc);  
   Console::WriteLine("Seconds since startup: {0}", seconds);  
   Console::WriteLine("Minutes since startup: {0}", minutes);  
   Console::WriteLine("Hours since startup: {0}", hours);  
   Console::WriteLine("Days since startup: {0}", days);  
  
   return 0;  
}  
```
