# Property Index Declaration
The syntax for declaring an indexed property has changed from Managed Extensions for C++ to Visual C++.  
  
 The two primary shortcoming of the Managed Extensions language support of indexed properties is the inability to provide class-level subscripting; that is, all indexed properties are required to be given a name, and thus there is no way, for example, to provide a managed subscript operator that can be directly applied to a `Vector` or `Matrix` class object. A second less significant shortcoming is that it is visually difficult to distinguish a property from an indexed property - the number of parameters is the only indication. Finally, indexed properties suffer from the same problems as those of non-indexed properties - the accessors are not treated as an atomic unit, but separated into individual methods.  For example:  
  
```  
public __gc class Vector;  
public __gc class Matrix {  
   float mat[,];  
  
public:   
   __property void set_Item( int r, int c, float value);  
   __property float get_Item( int r, int c );  
  
   __property void set_Row( int r, Vector* value );  
   __property Vector* get_Row( int r );  
};  
```  
  
 As you can see here, the indexers are distinguished only by the additional parameters to specify a two or single dimension index. In the new syntax, the indexers are distinguished by the bracket ([,]) following the name of the indexer and indicating the number and type of each index:  
  
```  
public ref class Vector {};  
public ref class Matrix {  
private:  
   array<float, 2>^ mat;  
  
public:  
   property float Item [int,int] {  
      float get( int r, int c );  
      void set( int r, int c, float value );  
   }  
  
   property Vector^ Row [int] {  
      Vector^ get( int r );  
      void set( int r, Vector^ value );  
   }  
};  
```  
  
 To indicate a class level indexer that can be applied directly to objects of the class in the new syntax, the `default` keyword is reused to substitute for an explicit name. For example:  
  
```  
public ref class Matrix {  
private:  
   array<float, 2>^ mat;  
  
public:  
   // ok: class level indexer now  
   //  
   //     Matrix mat;  
   //     mat[ 0, 0 ] = 1;   
   //  
   // invokes the set accessor of the default indexer  
  
   property float default [int,int] {  
      float get( int r, int c );  
      void set( int r, int c, float value );  
   }  
  
   property Vector^ Row [int] {  
      Vector^ get( int r );  
      void set( int r, Vector^ value );  
   }  
};  
```  
  
 In the new syntax, when the default indexed property is specified, the two following names are reserved: `get_Item` and `set_Item`. This is because these are the underlying names generated for the default indexed property.  
  
 Note that there is no simple index syntax analogous to the simple property syntax.
