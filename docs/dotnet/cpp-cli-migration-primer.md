# C++/CLI Migration Primer
This is a guide to moving your Visual C++ programs from Managed Extensions for C++ to Visual C++. 
  
 C++/CLI extends a dynamic component programming paradigm to the ISO-C++ standard language. The new language offers a number of significant improvements over Managed Extensions. This section provides an enumerated listing of the Managed Extensions for C++ language features and their mapping to Visual C++ where such a mapping exists, and points out those constructs for which no mapping exists.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Outline of Changes (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/outline-of-changes-cpp-cli.md)  
 A high-level outline for quick reference, providing a listing of the changes under five general categories.  
  
 [Language Keywords (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/language-keywords-cpp-cli.md)  
 Discusses changes in language keywords, including the removal of the double underscore and the introduction of both contextual and spaced keywords.  
  
 [Managed Types (C++/CL)](../dotnet/managed-types-cpp-cl.md)  
 Looks at syntactic changes in the declaration of the Common Type System (CTS) - this includes changes in the declaration of classes, arrays (including the parameter array), enums, and so on.  
  
 [Member Declarations within a Class or Interface (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/member-declarations-within-a-class-or-interface-cpp-cli.md)  
 Presents the changes involving class members such as scalar properties, index properties, operators, delegates, and events.  
  
 [Value Types and Their Behaviors (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/value-types-and-their-behaviors-cpp-cli.md)  
 Focuses on value types and the new family of interior and pinning pointers. It also discusses a number of significant semantics changes such as the introduction of implicit boxing, immutability of boxed value types, and the removal of support for default constructors within value classes.  
  
 [General Language Changes (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/general-language-changes-cpp-cli.md)  
 Details semantic changes such as support for cast notation, string literal behavior, and changes in the semantics between ISO-C++ and C++/CLI.
