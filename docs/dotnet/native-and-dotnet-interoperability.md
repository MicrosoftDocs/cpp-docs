# Native and .NET Interoperability
Visual C++ supports interoperability features that allow managed and unmanaged constructs to co-exist and interoperate within the same assembly, and even in the same file. A small subset of this functionality, such as P/Invoke, is supported by other .NET languages as well, but most of the interoperability support provided by Visual C++ is not available in other languages.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Mixed (Native and Managed) Assemblies](../dotnet/mixed-native-and-managed-assemblies.md)  
 Describes assemblies generated with the [/clr (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md) compiler option that contain both managed and unmanaged functionality.  
  
 [Using a Windows Form User Control in MFC](../dotnet/using-a-windows-form-user-control-in-mfc.md)  
 Discusses how to use the MFC Windows Forms support classes to host Windows Forms controls within your MFC applications.  
  
 [Calling Native Functions from Managed Code](../dotnet/calling-native-functions-from-managed-code.md)  
 Describes how non-CLR DLLs can be used from .NET applications.
