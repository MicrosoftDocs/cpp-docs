# Native and .NET Interoperability

Visual C++ supports interoperability features that allow managed and unmanaged constructs to co-exist and interoperate within the same assembly, and even in the same file. A small subset of this functionality, such as P/Invoke, is supported by other .NET languages as well, but most of the interoperability support provided by Visual C++ is not available in other languages.

## In This Section

[Mixed (Native and Managed) Assemblies](../dotnet/mixed-native-and-managed-assemblies.md)<br/>
Describes assemblies generated with the [/clr (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md) compiler option that contain both managed and unmanaged functionality.

[Using a Windows Form User Control in MFC](../dotnet/using-a-windows-form-user-control-in-mfc.md)<br/>
Discusses how to use the MFC Windows Forms support classes to host Windows Forms controls within your MFC applications.

[Calling Native Functions from Managed Code](../dotnet/calling-native-functions-from-managed-code.md)<br/>
Describes how non-CLR DLLs can be used from .NET applications.
