# How to: Retrieve the Current Username (C++/CLI)
The following code example demonstrates the retrieval of the current user name (the name of the user logged into Windows). The name is stored in the <xref:System.Environment.UserName%2A> string, which is defined in the <xref:System.Environment> namespace.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// username.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
using namespace System;  
  
int main()   
{  
   Console::WriteLine("\nCurrent user: {0}", Environment::UserName);  
   return 0;  
}  
```
