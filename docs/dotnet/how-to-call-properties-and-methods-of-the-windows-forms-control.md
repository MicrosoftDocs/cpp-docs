# How to: Call Properties and Methods of the Windows Forms Control
Because [CWinFormsView::GetControl](../mfc/reference/cwinformsview-class.md#getcontrol) returns a pointer to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control?displayProperty=fullName>, and not a pointer to `WindowsControlLibrary1::UserControl1`, it is advisable to add a member of the user control type and initialize it in [IView::OnInitialUpdate](../mfc/reference/iview-interface.md#oninitialupdate). Now you can call methods and properties using `m_ViewControl`.  
  
 This topic assumes you have previously completed [How to: Create the User Control and Host in a Dialog Box](../dotnet/how-to-create-the-user-control-and-host-in-a-dialog-box.md) and [How to: Create the User Control and Host MDI View](../dotnet/how-to-create-the-user-control-and-host-mdi-view.md).  
  
### To create the MFC host application  
  
1.  Open the MFC application you created in [How to: Create the User Control and Host MDI View](../dotnet/how-to-create-the-user-control-and-host-mdi-view.md).  
  
2.  Add the following line to the public overrides section of the `CMFC02View` class declaration in MFC02View.h.  
  
     `gcroot<WindowsFormsControlLibrary1::UserControl1 ^> m_ViewControl;`  
  
3.  Add an override for OnInitialupdate.  
  
     Display the **Properties** window (F4). In **Class View** (CTRL+SHIFT+C), select CMFC02View class. In the **Properties** window, select the icon for Overrides. Scoll down the list to OnInitialUpdate. Click on the drop down list and select \<Add>. In MFC02View.cpp. make sure the body of the OnInitialUpdate function is as follows:  
  
    ```  
    CWinFormsView::OnInitialUpdate();  
    m_ViewControl = safe_cast<WindowsFormsControlLibrary1::UserControl1 ^>(this->GetControl());  
    m_ViewControl->textBox1->Text = gcnew System::String("hi");  
    ```  
  
4.  Build and run the project.  
  
     On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.  
  
     On the **Debug** menu, click **Start without debugging**.  
  
     Notice that the text box is now initialized.
