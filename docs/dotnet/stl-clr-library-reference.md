# STL/CLR Library Reference
The STL/CLR Library is a packaging of a subset of the C++ Standard Library for use with C++ and the .NET Framework common language runtime (CLR). With STL/CLR, you can use all the containers, iterators, and algorithms of the standard library in a managed environment.  
  
 To use STL/CLR:  
  
-   Include headers from the **cliext** include subdirectory instead of the usual C++ Standard Library equivalents.  
  
-   Qualify library names with `cliext::` instead of `std::`.  
  
 STL/CLR exposes the generic types and interfaces that it uses in cross-assembly scenarios in the .NET assembly **Microsoft.VisualC.STLCLR.dll**. This DLL is included in .NET Framework 3.5. If you redistribute an application that uses STL/CLR, you will need to include the .NET Framework 3.5, as well as any other Visual C++ libraries that your project uses, in the dependencies section of your setup project.  
  
## In This Section  
 [cliext Namespace](../dotnet/cliext-namespace.md)  
 Discusses the namespace that contains all the types of the STL/CLR Library.  
  
 [STL/CLR Containers](../dotnet/stl-clr-containers.md)  
 Provides an overview of the containers that are found in the C++ Standard Library, including requirements for container elements, types of elements that can be inserted, and ownership issues.  
  
 [Requirements for STL/CLR Container Elements](../dotnet/requirements-for-stl-clr-container-elements.md)  
 Describes minimum requirements for all reference types that are inserted into C++ Standard Library containers.  
  
 [How to: Convert from a .NET Collection to a STL/CLR Container](../dotnet/how-to-convert-from-a-dotnet-collection-to-a-stl-clr-container.md)  
 Describes how to convert a .NET collection to an STL/CLR container.  
  
 [How to: Convert from a STL/CLR Container to a .NET Collection](../dotnet/how-to-convert-from-a-stl-clr-container-to-a-dotnet-collection.md)  
 Describes how to convert an STL/CLR container to a .NET collection.  
  
 [How to: Expose an STL/CLR Container from an Assembly](../dotnet/how-to-expose-an-stl-clr-container-from-an-assembly.md)  
 Shows how to display the elements of several STL/CLR containers written in a C++ assembly.  
  
 In addition, this section also describes the following components of STL/CLR:
