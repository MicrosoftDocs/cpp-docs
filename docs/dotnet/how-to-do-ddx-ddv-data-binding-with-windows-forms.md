# How to: Do DDX/DDV Data Binding with Windows Forms

[DDX_ManagedControl](../mfc/reference/standard-dialog-data-exchange-routines.md#ddx_managedcontrol) calls [CWinFormsControl::CreateManagedControl](../mfc/reference/cwinformscontrol-class.md#createmanagedcontrol) to create a control matching the resource control ID. If you use `DDX_ManagedControl` for a `CWinFormsControl` control (in wizard-generated code), you should not call `CreateManagedControl` explicitly for the same control.

Call `DDX_ManagedControl` in [CWnd::DoDataExchange](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md#dodataexchange) to create controls from resource IDs. For data exchange, you do not need to use the DDX/DDV functions with Windows Forms controls. Instead, you can place code to access the properties of the managed control in the `DoDataExchange` method of your dialog (or view) class, as in the following example.

The following example shows how to bind a native C++ string to a .NET user control.

## Example: DDX/DDV data binding

The following is an example of DDX/DDV data binding of an MFC string `m_str` with the user-defined `NameText` property of a .NET user control.

The control is created when [CDialog::OnInitDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#oninitdialog) calls `CMyDlg::DoDataExchange` for the first time, so any code that references `m_UserControl` must come after the `DDX_ManagedControl` call.

You can implement this code in the MFC01 application you created in [How to: Create the User Control and Host in a Dialog Box](../dotnet/how-to-create-the-user-control-and-host-in-a-dialog-box.md).

Put the following code in the declaration of CMFC01Dlg:

```
class CMFC01Dlg : public CDialog
{
   CWinFormsControl<WindowsFormsControlLibrary1::UserControl1> m_MyControl;
   CString m_str;
};
```

## Example: Implement DoDataExchange()

Put the following code in the implementation of CMFC01Dlg:

```cpp
void CMFC01Dlg::DoDataExchange(CDataExchange* pDX)
{
   CDialog::DoDataExchange(pDX);
   DDX_ManagedControl(pDX, IDC_CTRL1, m_MyControl);

   if (pDX->m_bSaveAndValidate) {
      m_str = m_MyControl->textBox1->Text;
   } else
   {
      m_MyControl->textBox1->Text = gcnew System::String(m_str);
   }
}
```

## Example: Add handler method

Now we will add the handler method for a click on the OK button. Click the **Resource View** tab. In Resource View, double-click on `IDD_MFC01_DIALOG`. The dialog resource appears in Resource Editor. Then double click the OK button.

Define the handler as follows.

```cpp
void CMFC01Dlg::OnBnClickedOk()
{
   AfxMessageBox(CString(m_MyControl.GetControl()->textBox1->Text));
   OnOK();
}
```

## Example: Set the textBox text

And add the following line to the implementation of BOOL CMFC01Dlg::OnInitDialog().

```
m_MyControl.GetControl()->textBox1->Text = "hello";
```

You can now build and run the application. Notice that any text in the text box will be displayed in a pop-up message box when the application closes.
