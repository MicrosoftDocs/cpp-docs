# Managed Types (C++/CL)
The syntax for the declaration of managed types and the creation and use of objects of these types has been significantly altered from Managed Extensions for C++ to Visual C++. This was done to promote their integration within the ISO-C++ type system. These changes are presented in detail in the following subsections.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Declaration of a Managed Class Type](../dotnet/declaration-of-a-managed-class-type.md)  
 Discusses how to declare a managed `class`, `struct`, or `interface`.  
  
 [Declaration of a CLR Reference Class Object](../dotnet/declaration-of-a-clr-reference-class-object.md)  
 Discusses how to declare a reference class type object using a tracking handle.  
  
 [Declaration of a CLR Array](../dotnet/declaration-of-a-clr-array.md)  
 Explains how to declare and initialize an array.  
  
 [Changes in Constructor Initialization Order](../dotnet/changes-in-constructor-initialization-order.md)  
 Discusses key changes in class constructor initialization order.  
  
 [Changes in Destructor Semantics](../dotnet/changes-in-destructor-semantics.md)  
 Discusses non-deterministic finalization, `Finalize` versus `Dispose`, ramifications for reference objects, and use of an explicit `Finalize`.  
  
 **Note:** The discussion of delegates is deferred until [Delegates and Events](../dotnet/delegates-and-events.md) in order to present them with event members within a class, the general topic of [Member Declarations within a Class or Interface (C++/CLI)](../dotnet/member-declarations-within-a-class-or-interface-cpp-cli.md).
