# Hosting a Windows Forms User Control as an MFC View

MFC uses the CWinFormsView class to host a Windows Forms user control in an MFC view. MFC Windows Forms views are ActiveX controls. The user control is hosted as a child of the native view and occupies the entire client area of the native view.

The end result resembles the model used by the [CFormView Class](../mfc/reference/cformview-class.md). This lets you take advantage of the Windows Forms designer and runtime to create rich form-based views.

Because MFC Windows Forms views are ActiveX controls, they do not have the same `hwnd` as MFC views. Also they cannot be passed as a pointer to a [CView](../mfc/reference/cview-class.md) view. In general, use .NET Framework methods to work with Windows Forms views and rely less on Win32.
