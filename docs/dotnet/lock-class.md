# lock Class

This class automates taking a lock for synchronizing access to an object from several threads.  When constructed it acquires the lock and when destroyed it releases the lock.

## Syntax

```cpp
ref class lock;
```

## Remarks

`lock` is available only for CLR objects and can only be used in CLR code.

Internally, the lock class uses <xref:System.Threading.Monitor> to synchronize access. For more information, see the referenced article.

## Members

### Public constructors

|Name|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|[lock::lock](#lock)|Constructs a `lock` object, optionally waiting to acquire the lock forever, for a specified amount of time, or not at all.|
|[lock::~lock](#tilde-lock)|Destructs a `lock` object.|

### Public methods

|Name|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|[lock::acquire](#acquire)|Acquires a lock on an object, optionally waiting to acquire the lock forever, for a specified amount of time, or not at all.|
|[lock::is_locked](#is-locked)|Indicates whether a lock is being held.|
|[lock::release](#release)|Releases a lock.|
|[lock::try_acquire](#try-acquire)|Acquires a lock on an object, waiting for a specified amount of time and returning a **`bool`** to report the success of acquisition instead of throwing an exception.|

### Public operators

|Name|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|[lock::operator&nbsp;bool](#operator-bool)|Operator for using `lock` in a conditional expression.|
|[lock::operator==](#operator-equality)|Equality operator.|
|[lock::operator!=](#operator-inequality)|Inequality operator.|

## Requirements

**Header file** \<msclr\lock.h>

**Namespace** msclr

## <a name="lock"></a> lock::lock

Constructs a `lock` object, optionally waiting to acquire the lock forever, for a specified amount of time, or not at all.

```cpp
template<class T> lock(
   T ^ _object
);
template<class T> lock(
   T ^ _object,
   int _timeout
);
template<class T> lock(
   T ^ _object,
   System::TimeSpan _timeout
);
template<class T> lock(
   T ^ _object,
   lock_later
);
```

### Parameters

*_object*<br/>
The object to be locked.

*_timeout*<br/>
Time out value in milliseconds or as a <xref:System.TimeSpan>.

### Exceptions

Throws <xref:System.ApplicationException> if lock acquisition doesn't occur before timeout.

### Remarks

The first three forms of the constructor try to acquire a lock on `_object` within the specified timeout period (or <xref:System.Threading.Timeout.Infinite> if none is specified).

The fourth form of the constructor doesn't acquire a lock on `_object`. `lock_later` is a member of the [lock_when enum](../dotnet/lock-when-enum.md). Use [lock::acquire](#acquire) or [lock::try_acquire](#try-acquire) to acquire the lock in this case.

The lock will automatically be released when the destructor is called.

`_object` can't be <xref:System.Threading.ReaderWriterLock>.  If it is, a compiler error will result.

### Example

This example uses a single instance of a class across several threads. The class uses a lock on itself to make sure that accesses to its internal data are consistent for each thread. The main application thread uses a lock on the same instance of the class to periodically check to see if any worker threads still exist. The main application then waits to exit until all worker threads have completed their tasks.

```cpp
// msl_lock_lock.cpp
// compile with: /clr
#include <msclr/lock.h>

using namespace System;
using namespace System::Threading;
using namespace msclr;

ref class CounterClass {
private:
   int Counter;

public:
   property int ThreadCount;

   // function called by multiple threads, use lock to keep Counter consistent
   // for each thread
   void UseCounter() {
      try {
         lock l(this); // wait infinitely

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Counter++;
            Thread::Sleep(10);
         }

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         Counter = 0;
         // lock is automatically released when it goes out of scope and its destructor is called
      }
      catch (...) {
         Console::WriteLine("Couldn't acquire lock!");
      }

      ThreadCount--;
   }
};

int main() {
   // create a few threads to contend for access to the shared data
   CounterClass^ cc = gcnew CounterClass;
   array<Thread^>^ tarr = gcnew array<Thread^>(5);
   ThreadStart^ startDelegate = gcnew ThreadStart(cc, &CounterClass::UseCounter);
   for (int i = 0; i < tarr->Length; i++) {
      tarr[i] = gcnew Thread(startDelegate);
      cc->ThreadCount++;
      tarr[i]->Start();
   }

   // keep our main thread alive until all worker threads have completed
   lock l(cc, lock_later); // don't lock now, just create the object
   while (true) {
      if (l.try_acquire(50)) { // try to acquire lock, don't throw an exception if can't
         if (0 == cc->ThreadCount) {
            Console::WriteLine("All threads completed.");
            break; // all threads are gone, exit while
         }
         else {
            Console::WriteLine("{0} threads exist, continue waiting...", cc->ThreadCount);
            l.release(); // some threads exist, let them do their work
         }
      }
   }
}
```

```Output
In thread 3, Counter = 0
In thread 3, Counter = 10
In thread 5, Counter = 0
In thread 5, Counter = 10
In thread 7, Counter = 0
In thread 7, Counter = 10
In thread 4, Counter = 0
In thread 4, Counter = 10
In thread 6, Counter = 0
In thread 6, Counter = 10
All threads completed.
```

## <a name="tilde-lock"></a> lock::~lock

Destructs a `lock` object.

```cpp
~lock();
```

### Remarks

The destructor calls [lock::release](#release).

### Example

This example uses a single instance of a class across several threads.  The class uses a lock on itself to make sure that accesses to its internal data are consistent for each thread.  The main application thread uses a lock on the same instance of the class to periodically check to see if any worker threads still exist. The main application then waits to exit until all worker threads have completed their tasks.

```cpp
// msl_lock_dtor.cpp
// compile with: /clr
#include <msclr/lock.h>

using namespace System;
using namespace System::Threading;
using namespace msclr;

ref class CounterClass {
private:
   int Counter;

public:
   property int ThreadCount;

   // function called by multiple threads, use lock to keep Counter consistent
   // for each thread
   void UseCounter() {
      try {
         lock l(this); // wait infinitely

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Counter++;
            Thread::Sleep(10);
         }

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         Counter = 0;
         // lock is automatically released when it goes out of scope and its destructor is called
      }
      catch (...) {
         Console::WriteLine("Couldn't acquire lock!");
      }

      ThreadCount--;
   }
};

int main() {
   // create a few threads to contend for access to the shared data
   CounterClass^ cc = gcnew CounterClass;
   array<Thread^>^ tarr = gcnew array<Thread^>(5);
   ThreadStart^ startDelegate = gcnew ThreadStart(cc, &CounterClass::UseCounter);
   for (int i = 0; i < tarr->Length; i++) {
      tarr[i] = gcnew Thread(startDelegate);
      cc->ThreadCount++;
      tarr[i]->Start();
   }

   // keep our main thread alive until all worker threads have completed
   lock l(cc, lock_later); // don't lock now, just create the object
   while (true) {
      if (l.try_acquire(50)) { // try to acquire lock, don't throw an exception if can't
         if (0 == cc->ThreadCount) {
            Console::WriteLine("All threads completed.");
            break; // all threads are gone, exit while
         }
         else {
            Console::WriteLine("{0} threads exist, continue waiting...", cc->ThreadCount);
            l.release(); // some threads exist, let them do their work
         }
      }
   }
}
```

```Output
In thread 3, Counter = 0
In thread 3, Counter = 10
In thread 5, Counter = 0
In thread 5, Counter = 10
In thread 7, Counter = 0
In thread 7, Counter = 10
In thread 4, Counter = 0
In thread 4, Counter = 10
In thread 6, Counter = 0
In thread 6, Counter = 10
All threads completed.
```

## <a name="acquire"></a> lock::acquire

Acquires a lock on an object, optionally waiting to acquire the lock forever, for a specified amount of time, or not at all.

```cpp
void acquire();
void acquire(
   int _timeout
);
void acquire(
   System::TimeSpan _timeout
);
```

### Parameters

*_timeout*<br/>
Timeout value in milliseconds or as a <xref:System.TimeSpan>.

### Exceptions

Throws <xref:System.ApplicationException> if lock acquisition doesn't occur before timeout.

### Remarks

If a timeout value isn't supplied, the default timeout is <xref:System.Threading.Timeout.Infinite>.

If a lock has already been acquired, this function does nothing.

### Example

This example uses a single instance of a class across several threads.  The class uses a lock on itself to make sure that accesses to its internal data are consistent for each thread. The main application thread uses a lock on the same instance of the class to periodically check to see if any worker threads still exist. The main application then waits to exit until all worker threads have completed their tasks.

```cpp
// msl_lock_acquire.cpp
// compile with: /clr
#include <msclr/lock.h>

using namespace System;
using namespace System::Threading;
using namespace msclr;

ref class CounterClass {
private:
   int Counter;

public:
   property int ThreadCount;

   // function called by multiple threads, use lock to keep Counter consistent
   // for each thread
   void UseCounter() {
      try {
         lock l(this); // wait infinitely

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Counter++;
            Thread::Sleep(10);
         }

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         Counter = 0;
         // lock is automatically released when it goes out of scope and its destructor is called
      }
      catch (...) {
         Console::WriteLine("Couldn't acquire lock!");
      }

      ThreadCount--;
   }
};

int main() {
   // create a few threads to contend for access to the shared data
   CounterClass^ cc = gcnew CounterClass;
   array<Thread^>^ tarr = gcnew array<Thread^>(5);
   ThreadStart^ startDelegate = gcnew ThreadStart(cc, &CounterClass::UseCounter);
   for (int i = 0; i < tarr->Length; i++) {
      tarr[i] = gcnew Thread(startDelegate);
      cc->ThreadCount++;
      tarr[i]->Start();
   }

   // keep our main thread alive until all worker threads have completed
   lock l(cc, lock_later); // don't lock now, just create the object
   while (true) {
      if (l.try_acquire(50)) { // try to acquire lock, don't throw an exception if can't
         if (0 == cc->ThreadCount) {
            Console::WriteLine("All threads completed.");
            break; // all threads are gone, exit while
         }
         else {
            Console::WriteLine("{0} threads exist, continue waiting...", cc->ThreadCount);
            l.release(); // some threads exist, let them do their work
         }
      }
   }
}
```

```Output
In thread 3, Counter = 0
In thread 3, Counter = 10
In thread 5, Counter = 0
In thread 5, Counter = 10
In thread 7, Counter = 0
In thread 7, Counter = 10
In thread 4, Counter = 0
In thread 4, Counter = 10
In thread 6, Counter = 0
In thread 6, Counter = 10
All threads completed.
```

## <a name="is-locked"></a> lock::is_locked

Indicates whether a lock is being held.

```cpp
bool is_locked();
```

### Return value

**`true`** if a lock is held, **`false`** otherwise.

### Example

This example uses a single instance of a class across several threads.  The class uses a lock on itself to make sure that accesses to its internal data are consistent for each thread.  The main application thread uses a lock on the same instance of the class to periodically check to see if any worker threads still exist, and waits to exit until all worker threads have completed their tasks.

```cpp
// msl_lock_is_locked.cpp
// compile with: /clr
#include <msclr/lock.h>

using namespace System;
using namespace System::Threading;
using namespace msclr;

ref class CounterClass {
private:
   int Counter;

public:
   property int ThreadCount;

   // function called by multiple threads, use lock to keep Counter consistent
   // for each thread
   void UseCounter() {
      try {
         lock l(this); // wait infinitely

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Counter++;
            Thread::Sleep(10);
         }

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         Counter = 0;
         // lock is automatically released when it goes out of scope and its destructor is called
      }
      catch (...) {
         Console::WriteLine("Couldn't acquire lock!");
      }

      ThreadCount--;
   }
};

int main() {
   // create a few threads to contend for access to the shared data
   CounterClass^ cc = gcnew CounterClass;
   array<Thread^>^ tarr = gcnew array<Thread^>(5);
   ThreadStart^ startDelegate = gcnew ThreadStart(cc, &CounterClass::UseCounter);
   for (int i = 0; i < tarr->Length; i++) {
      tarr[i] = gcnew Thread(startDelegate);
      cc->ThreadCount++;
      tarr[i]->Start();
   }

   // keep our main thread alive until all worker threads have completed
   lock l(cc, lock_later); // don't lock now, just create the object
   while (true) {
      l.try_acquire(50); // try to acquire lock, don't throw an exception if can't
      if (l.is_locked()) { // check if we got the lock
         if (0 == cc->ThreadCount) {
            Console::WriteLine("All threads completed.");
            break; // all threads are gone, exit while
         }
         else {
            Console::WriteLine("{0} threads exist, continue waiting...", cc->ThreadCount);
            l.release(); // some threads exist, let them do their work
         }
      }
   }
}
```

```Output
In thread 3, Counter = 0
In thread 3, Counter = 10
In thread 5, Counter = 0
In thread 5, Counter = 10
In thread 4, Counter = 0
In thread 4, Counter = 10
In thread 7, Counter = 0
In thread 7, Counter = 10
In thread 6, Counter = 0
In thread 6, Counter = 10
All threads completed.
```

## <a name="operator-bool"></a> lock::operator bool

Operator for using `lock` in a conditional expression.

```cpp
operator bool();
```

### Return value

**`true`** if a lock is held, **`false`** otherwise.

### Remarks

This operator actually converts to `_detail_class::_safe_bool` which is safer than **`bool`** because it can't be converted to an integral type.

### Example

This example uses a single instance of a class across several threads.  The class uses a lock on itself to make sure that accesses to its internal data are consistent for each thread. The main application thread uses a lock on the same instance of the class to periodically check to see if any worker threads still exist. The main application waits to exit until all worker threads have completed their tasks.

```cpp
// msl_lock_op_bool.cpp
// compile with: /clr
#include <msclr/lock.h>

using namespace System;
using namespace System::Threading;
using namespace msclr;

ref class CounterClass {
private:
   int Counter;

public:
   property int ThreadCount;

   // function called by multiple threads, use lock to keep Counter consistent
   // for each thread
   void UseCounter() {
      try {
         lock l(this); // wait infinitely

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Counter++;
            Thread::Sleep(10);
         }

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         Counter = 0;
         // lock is automatically released when it goes out of scope and its destructor is called
      }
      catch (...) {
         Console::WriteLine("Couldn't acquire lock!");
      }

      ThreadCount--;
   }
};

int main() {
   // create a few threads to contend for access to the shared data
   CounterClass^ cc = gcnew CounterClass;
   array<Thread^>^ tarr = gcnew array<Thread^>(5);
   ThreadStart^ startDelegate = gcnew ThreadStart(cc, &CounterClass::UseCounter);
   for (int i = 0; i < tarr->Length; i++) {
      tarr[i] = gcnew Thread(startDelegate);
      cc->ThreadCount++;
      tarr[i]->Start();
   }

   // keep our main thread alive until all worker threads have completed
   lock l(cc, lock_later); // don't lock now, just create the object
   while (true) {
      l.try_acquire(50); // try to acquire lock, don't throw an exception if can't
      if (l) { // use bool operator to check for lock
         if (0 == cc->ThreadCount) {
            Console::WriteLine("All threads completed.");
            break; // all threads are gone, exit while
         }
         else {
            Console::WriteLine("{0} threads exist, continue waiting...", cc->ThreadCount);
            l.release(); // some threads exist, let them do their work
         }
      }
   }
}
```

```Output
In thread 3, Counter = 0
In thread 3, Counter = 10
In thread 5, Counter = 0
In thread 5, Counter = 10
In thread 7, Counter = 0
In thread 7, Counter = 10
In thread 4, Counter = 0
In thread 4, Counter = 10
In thread 6, Counter = 0
In thread 6, Counter = 10
All threads completed.
```

## <a name="release"></a> lock::release

Releases a lock.

```cpp
void release();
```

### Remarks

If no lock is being held, `release` does nothing.

You don't have to call this function explicitly. When a `lock` object goes out of scope, its destructor calls `release`.

### Example

This example uses a single instance of a class across several threads. The class uses a lock on itself to make sure that accesses to its internal data are consistent for each thread. The main application thread uses a lock on the same instance of the class to periodically check to see if any worker threads still exist. The main application then waits to exit until all worker threads have completed their tasks.

```cpp
// msl_lock_release.cpp
// compile with: /clr
#include <msclr/lock.h>

using namespace System;
using namespace System::Threading;
using namespace msclr;

ref class CounterClass {
private:
   int Counter;

public:
   property int ThreadCount;

   // function called by multiple threads, use lock to keep Counter consistent
   // for each thread
   void UseCounter() {
      try {
         lock l(this); // wait infinitely

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Counter++;
            Thread::Sleep(10);
         }

         Console::WriteLine("In thread {0}, Counter = {1}", Thread::CurrentThread->ManagedThreadId,
            Counter);

         Counter = 0;
         // lock is automatically released when it goes out of scope and its destructor is called
      }
      catch (...) {
         Console::WriteLine("Couldn't acquire lock!");
      }

      ThreadCount--;
   }
};

int main() {
   // create a few threads to contend for access to the shared data
   CounterClass^ cc = gcnew CounterClass;
   array<Thread^>^ tarr = gcnew array<Thread^>(5);
   ThreadStart^ startDelegate = gcnew ThreadStart(cc, &CounterClass::UseCounter);
   for (int i = 0; i < tarr->Length; i++) {
      tarr[i] = gcnew Thread(startDelegate);
      cc->ThreadCount++;
      tarr[i]->Start();
   }

   // keep our main thread alive until all worker threads have completed
   lock l(cc, lock_later); // don't lock now, just create the object
   while (true) {
      if (l.try_acquire(50)) { // try to acquire lock, don't throw an exception if can't
         if (0 == cc->ThreadCount) {
            Console::WriteLine("All threads completed.");
            break; // all threads are gone, exit while
         }
         else {
            Console::WriteLine("{0} threads exist, continue waiting...", cc->ThreadCount);
            l.release(); // some threads exist, let them do their work
         }
      }
   }
}
```

```Output
In thread 3, Counter = 0
In thread 3, Counter = 10
In thread 5, Counter = 0
In thread 5, Counter = 10
In thread 7, Counter = 0
In thread 7, Counter = 10
In thread 4, Counter = 0
In thread 4, Counter = 10
In thread 6, Counter = 0
In thread 6, Counter = 10
All threads completed.
```

## <a name="try-acquire"></a> lock::try_acquire

Acquires a lock on an object, waiting for a specified amount of time and returning a **`bool`** to report the success of acquisition instead of throwing an exception.

```cpp
bool try_acquire(
   int _timeout_ms
);
bool try_acquire(
   System::TimeSpan _timeout
);
```

### Parameters

*_timeout*<br/>
Timeout value in milliseconds or as a <xref:System.TimeSpan>.

### Return value

**`true`** if lock was acquired, **`false`** otherwise.

### Remarks

If a lock has already been acquired, this function does nothing.

### Example

This example uses a single instance of a class across several threads. The class uses a lock on itself to make sure that accesses to its internal data are consistent for each thread. The main application thread uses a lock on the same instance of the class to periodically check to see if any worker threads still exist. The main application then waits to exit until all worker threads have completed their tasks.

```cpp
// msl_lock_try_acquire.cpp
// compile with: /clr
#include <msclr/lock.h>

using namespace System;

## <a name="operator-equality"></a> lock::operator==

Equality operator.

```cpp
template<class T> bool operator==(
   T t
);
```

### Parameters

*t*<br/>
The object to compare for equality.

### Return value

Returns **`true`** if `t` is the same as the lock's object, **`false`** otherwise.

### Example

```cpp
// msl_lock_op_eq.cpp
// compile with: /clr
#include <msclr/lock.h>

using namespace System;
using namespace System::Threading;
using namespace msclr;

int main () {
   Object^ o1 = gcnew Object;
   lock l1(o1);
   if (l1 == o1) {
      Console::WriteLine("Equal!");
   }
}
```

```Output
Equal!
```

## <a name="operator-inequality"></a> lock::operator!=

Inequality operator.

```cpp
template<class T> bool operator!=(
   T t
);
```

### Parameters

*t*<br/>
The object to compare for inequality.

### Return value

Returns **`true`** if `t` differs from the lock's object, **`false`** otherwise.

### Example

```cpp
// msl_lock_op_ineq.cpp
// compile with: /clr
#include <msclr/lock.h>

using namespace System;
using namespace System::Threading;
using namespace msclr;

int main () {
   Object^ o1 = gcnew Object;
   Object^ o2 = gcnew Object;
   lock l1(o1);
   if (l1 != o2) {
      Console::WriteLine("Inequal!");
   }
}
```

```Output
Inequal!
```
