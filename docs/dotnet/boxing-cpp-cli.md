# Boxing (C++/CLI)
Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the type `object` or to any interface type that's implemented by the value type. When the common language runtime (CLR) boxes a value type, it wraps the value in a `System.Object` and stores it on the managed heap. Unboxing extracts the value type from the object. Boxing is implicit; unboxing is explicit.
