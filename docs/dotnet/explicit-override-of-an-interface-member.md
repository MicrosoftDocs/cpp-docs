# Explicit Override of an Interface Member
The syntax for declaring an explicit override of an interface member within a class has changed from Managed Extensions for C++ to Visual C++.  
  
 You often want to provide two instances of an interface member within a class that implements the interface - one that is used when class objects are manipulated through an interface handle, and one that is used when class objects are used through the class interface. For example:  
  
```  
public __gc class R : public ICloneable {  
   // to be used through ICloneable  
   Object* ICloneable::Clone();  
  
   // to be used through an R  
   R* Clone();  
};  
```  
  
 In Managed Extensions we do this by providing an explicit declaration of the interface method with the method's name qualified with the name of the interface. The class-specific instance is unqualified. This eliminates the need to downcast the return value of `Clone`, in this example, when explicit called through an instance of `R`.  
  
 In the new syntax, a general overriding mechanism has been introduced that replaces the Managed Extensions syntax. Our example would be rewritten as follows:  
  
```  
public ref class R : public ICloneable {  
public:  
   // to be used through ICloneable  
   virtual Object^ InterfaceClone() = ICloneable::Clone;  
  
   // to be used through an R  
   virtual R^ Clone();  
};  
```  
  
 This revision requires that the interface member being explicitly overridden be given a unique name within the class. Here, I've provided the awkward name of `InterfaceClone`. The behavior is still the same - an invocation through the `ICloneable` interface invokes the renamed `InterfaceClone`, while a call through an object of type `R` invokes the second `Clone` instance.
