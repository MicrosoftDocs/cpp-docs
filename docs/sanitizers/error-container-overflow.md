# Error: `container-overflow`

> Address Sanitizer Error: Container overflow

In Visual Studio 2022 version 17.2 and later, the MSVC standard library (STL) is partially enlightened to understand the AddressSanitizer. The following container types have inserted extra annotations to detect memory access issues:

| Standard container type | Disable annotations macro | Supported in version |
|--|--|--|
| `std::vector` | `_DISABLE_VECTOR_ANNOTATION` | Visual Studio 2022 17.2 |

When a standard type has annotations enabled, to avoid one-definition-rule (ODR) violations, each static library and object used to link the binary must also enable those annotations. Effectively, you must build those static libraries and objects with AddressSanitizer enabled. Mixing code with different annotation settings causes an error:

```Output
my_static.lib(my_code.obj) : error LNK2038: mismatch detected for 'annotate_vector': value '0' doesn't match value '1' in main.obj
```

To resolve this error, either disable annotations in all projects that use the corresponding macro, or build each project by using **`/fsanitize=address`** and annotations enabled. (Annotations are enabled by default.)

## Example: Access reserved memory in a `std::vector`

```cpp
// Compile with: cl /EHsc /fsanitize=address /Zi
#include <vector>

int main() {   
    // Create a vector of size 10, but with a capacity of 20.    
    std::vector<int> v(10);
    v.reserve(20);

    // In versions prior to 17.2, MSVC ASan does NOT raise an exception here.
    // While this is an out-of-bounds write to 'v', MSVC ASan
    // ensures the write is within the heap allocation size (20).
    // With 17.2 and later, MSVC ASan will raise a 'container-overflow' exception:
    // ==18364==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: container-overflow on address 0x1263cb8a0048 at pc 0x7ff6466411ab bp 0x005cf81ef7b0 sp 0x005cf81ef7b8
    v[10] = 1;

    // Regardless of version, MSVC ASan DOES raise an exception here, as this write
    // is out of bounds from the heap allocation.
    v[20] = 1;
}
```

To build and test this example, run the following commands in a Visual Studio 2022 version 17.2 or later [Developer command prompt](../build/building-on-the-command-line.md#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts) window:

```cmd
cl /EHsc example1.cpp /fsanitize=address /Zi
devenv /debugexe example1.exe
```

## Custom Allocators plus Container Overflow

Address Sanitizer container overflow checking does support non-`std::allocator` allocators; however, because ASan can't trust custom allocators to have some important properties, it may not always be able to check that accesses on the latter end of an allocation are correct.

ASan marks blocks of memory in 8-byte chunks, and due to how its shadow memory works, it can't place inaccessible bytes before accessible bytes in a single chunk. In other words, it's valid to have 8 accessible bytes in a chunk, or 4 accessible bytes followed by 4 inaccessible bytes, but you can't have 4 inaccessible bytes followed by 4 accessible bytes.

So, if the end of an allocation from a custom allocator doesn't strictly align with the end of an 8-byte chunk, there's a problem. ASan must assume that the bytes after the end of the allocation, but before the end of the chunk, may be in use by someone else. Therefore, it can't mark the bytes in the final 8-byte chunk as inaccessible. For example:

```cpp
std::vector<uint8_t, MyCustomAlloc<uint8_t>> v;
v.reserve(20);
v.assign({0, 1, 2, 3});
// the buffer of `v` is as follows:
//    | v.data()
//    |       | v.data() + v.size()
//    |       |                                     | v.data() + v.capacity()
//  [ 0 1 2 3 ? ? ? ? ][ ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ][ ? ? ? ? - - - - ]
//        chunk 1            chunk 2            chunk 3
```

Ideally, we'd mark the shadow memory such that `v.data() + [0, v.size())` are accessible, and `v.data() + [v.size(), v.capacity())` are inaccessible. However, since the user is using a custom allocator that we don't have information about, we can't know whether the memory after `v.data() + v.capacity()` is accessible or not, so we must assume that it is. Therefore, even though we'd prefer to mark those bytes as inaccessible, we must instead mark them as accessible so it's still possible to access the bytes after the allocation.

`std::allocator` uses the `_Minimum_asan_allocation_alignment` static member variable as a way to tell `vector` and `string` that they can trust the allocator not to put data right after the allocation, so the pointer returned by the allocation functions. If you want the implementation to trust an allocator of your own, you can also set `_Minimum_asan_allocation_alignment` to your actual minimum alignment. (For ASan to work correctly, the alignment must be at least `8`.)
