# Error: `heap-use-after-free`

> Address Sanitizer Error: Use of deallocated memory

## Remarks

We show three examples where storage in the heap can be allocated via `malloc`, `realloc` (C), and `new` (C++), along with a mistaken use of `volatile`.

## Example - `malloc`

```cpp
// example1.cpp
// heap-use-after-free error
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  char *x = (char*)malloc(10 * sizeof(char));
  free(x);

  // ...

  return x[5];   // Boom!
}
```

To build and test this example, run these commands in a Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9 or later [developer command prompt](../build/building-on-the-command-line.md#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts):

```cmd
cl example1.cpp /fsanitize=address /Zi
devenv /debugexe example1.exe
```

When Visual Studio appears, press `F5` to run example 1.

### Resulting error

:::image type="complex" source="media/heap-use-after-free-example-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the debugger displaying use of deallocated memory error for example 1." border="true":::
The exception thrown dialog points to line 11, return x [ 5 ], and says: Address Sanitizer Error Use of deallocated memory. Not shown in the screenshot is the output in the console window that shows memory addresses, and a key to identify addressable bytes, partially addressable bytes, freed heap regions, and heap left red zone bytes in the area of the error.

## Example - `operator new`

```cpp
// example2.cpp
// heap-use-after-free error
#include <windows.h>

int main() {
  char *buffer = new char[42];
  delete [] buffer;

  // ...

  buffer[0] = 42;  // Boom!
  return 0;
}
```

To build and test this example, run these commands in a Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9 or later [developer command prompt](../build/building-on-the-command-line.md#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts):

```cmd
cl example2.cpp /fsanitize=address /Zi
devenv /debugexe example2.exe
```

When Visual Studio appears, press `F5` to run example 2.

### Resulting error - operator new

The exception thrown dialog points to line 11, buffer[0] = 42, and says: Address Sanitizer Error: Use of deallocated memory. Not shown in the screenshot is the output in the console window that shows memory addresses, and a key to identify addressable bytes, partially addressable bytes, freed heap regions, and heap left alloca red zone bytes in the area of the error.

## Example - `realloc`

```cpp
// example3.cpp
// heap-use-after-free error
#include <malloc.h>

int main() {
  char *buffer = (char*)realloc(0, 42);
  free(buffer);

  // ...

  buffer[0] = 42;  // Boom!
  return 0;
}
```

To build and test this example, run these commands in a Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9 or later [developer command prompt](../build/building-on-the-command-line.md#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts):

```cmd
cl example3.cpp /fsanitize=address /Zi
devenv /debugexe example3.exe
```

When Visual Studio appears, press `F5` to run example 3.

### Resulting error - realloc

## Example - volatile

```cpp
// example4.cpp
// heap-use-after-free error
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

  volatile char *x = (char*)malloc(sizeof(char));
  free((void*)x);

      //...

  *x = 42;        // Boom!
}
```

To build and test this example, run these commands in a Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9 or later [developer command prompt](../build/building-on-the-command-line.md#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts):

```cmd
cl example4.cpp /fsanitize=address /Zi
devenv /debugexe example4.exe
```

When Visual Studio appears, press `F5` to run example 4.

### Resulting error - volatile

The exception thrown dialog points to line 12, *x = 42, and says: Address Sanitizer Error: Use of deallocated memory. Not shown in the screenshot is the output in the console window that shows memory addresses, and a key to identify addressable bytes, heap left red zone bytes, and some addressable and partially addressable bytes in the area of the error.
