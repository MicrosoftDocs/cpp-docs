# Error: `memcpy-param-overlap`

> Address Sanitizer Error: memcpy-param-overlap

## Remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The `/Oi` flag is required to reliably detect `memcpy-param-overlap` errors. This flag tells the compiler to treat `memcpy` and other functions as intrinsics, which is necessary because some versions of the standard library implement them as such. Since ASan is a dynamic analysis tool, it can only detect errors with an observable runtime effect. Note that when `/O2` is also set, ASan may not be able to reliably detect `memcpy-param-overlap` errors because the intrinsic variant of these functions isn't guaranteed to be used. For more information, see [`/Oi` docs](../build/reference/oi-generate-intrinsic-functions.md).

The CRT function [`memcpy`](../c-runtime-library/reference/memcpy-wmemcpy.md) **doesn't support** overlapping memory. The CRT provides an alternative to `memcpy` that does support overlapping memory: [`memmove`](../c-runtime-library/reference/memmove-wmemmove.md).

A common error is to treat `memmove` as being semantically equivalent to `memcpy`.

## Example

```cpp
// example1.cpp
// memcpy-param-overlap error
#include <string.h>

__declspec(noinline) void bad_function() {
    char buffer[] = "hello";

    memcpy(buffer, buffer + 1, 5); // BOOM!
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    bad_function();
    return 0;
}
```

To build and test this example, run these commands in a Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9 or later [developer command prompt](../build/building-on-the-command-line.md#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts):

```cmd
cl example1.cpp /fsanitize=address /Zi /Oi
devenv /debugexe example1.exe
```
