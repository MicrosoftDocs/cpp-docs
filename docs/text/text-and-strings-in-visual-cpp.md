# Text and Strings in Visual C++

An important aspect of developing applications for international markets is the adequate representation of local character sets. The ASCII character set defines characters in the range 0x00 - 0x7F. There are other character sets, primarily European, that define the characters within the range 0x00 - 0x7F identically to the ASCII character set and also define an extended character set from 0x80 - 0xFF. Thus, an 8-bit, single-byte-character set (SBCS) is sufficient to represent the ASCII character set and the character sets for many European languages. However, some non-European character sets, such as Japanese Kanji, include many more characters than a single-byte coding scheme can represent, and therefore require multibyte-character set (MBCS) encoding.

## In This Section

[Unicode and MBCS](../text/unicode-and-mbcs.md)<br/>
Discusses Visual C++ support for Unicode and MBCS programming.

[Support for Unicode](../text/support-for-unicode.md)<br/>
Describes Unicode, a specification for supporting all character sets, including character sets that cannot be represented in a single byte.

[Support for Multibyte Character Sets (MBCS)](../text/support-for-multibyte-character-sets-mbcss.md)<br/>
Discusses MBCS, an alternative to Unicode for supporting character sets, like Japanese and Chinese, that cannot be represented in a single byte.

[Generic-Text Mappings in tchar.h](../text/generic-text-mappings-in-tchar-h.md)<br/>
Provides Microsoft-specific generic-text mappings for many data types, routines, and other objects.
