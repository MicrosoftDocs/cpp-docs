# Incrementing and Decrementing Pointers
Use the following tips:  
  
-   Point to lead bytes, not trail bytes. It is usually unsafe to have a pointer to a trail byte. It is usually safer to scan a string forward rather than in reverse.  
  
-   There are pointer increment/decrement functions and macros available that move over a whole character:  
  
    ```  
    sz1++;  
    ```  
  
     becomes:  
  
    ```  
    sz1 = _mbsinc( sz1 );  
    ```  
  
     The `_mbsinc` and `_mbsdec` functions correctly increment and decrement in `character` units, regardless of the character size.  
  
-   For decrements, you need a pointer to the head of the string, as in the following:  
  
    ```  
    sz2--;  
    ```  
  
     becomes:  
  
    ```  
    sz2 = _mbsdec( sz2Head, sz2 );  
    ```  
  
     Alternatively, your head pointer could be to a valid character in the string, such that:  
  
    ```  
    sz2Head < sz2  
    ```  
  
     You must have a pointer to a known valid lead byte.  
  
-   You might want to maintain a pointer to the previous character for faster calls to `_mbsdec`.
