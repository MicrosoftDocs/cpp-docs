# Benefits of Character Set Portability
You can benefit from using MFC and C run-time portability features even if you do not currently intend to internationalize your application:  
  
-   Coding portably makes your code base flexible. You can later move it easily to Unicode or MBCS.  
  
-   Using Unicode makes your applications for Windows more efficient. Because Windows uses Unicode, non-Unicode strings passed to and from the operating system must be translated, which incurs overhead.
