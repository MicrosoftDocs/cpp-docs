# Benefits of Character Set Portability

You can benefit from using MFC and C run-time portability features even if you do not currently intend to internationalize your application:

- Coding portably makes your code base flexible. You can later move it easily to Unicode or MBCS.

- Using Unicode makes your applications for Windows more efficient. Because Windows uses Unicode, non-Unicode strings passed to and from the operating system must be translated, which incurs overhead.
