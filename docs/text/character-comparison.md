# Character Comparison

Use the following tips:

- Comparing a known lead byte with an ASCII character works correctly:

    ```cpp
    if( *sz1 == 'A' )
    ```

- Comparing two unknown characters requires the use of one of the macros defined in Mbstring.h:

    ```cpp
    if( !_mbccmp( sz1, sz2) )
    ```

   This ensures that both bytes of a double-byte character are compared for equality.
