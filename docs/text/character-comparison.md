# Character Comparison
Use the following tips:  
  
-   Comparing a known lead byte with an ASCII character works correctly:  
  
    ```  
    if( *sz1 == 'A' )  
    ```  
  
-   Comparing two unknown characters requires the use of one of the macros defined in Mbstring.h:  
  
    ```  
    if( !_mbccmp( sz1, sz2) )  
    ```  
  
     This ensures that both bytes of a double-byte character are compared for equality.
