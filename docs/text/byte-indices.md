# Byte Indices

Use the following tips:

- Working with a bytewise index into a string presents problems similar to those posed by pointer manipulation. Consider this example, which scans a string for a backslash character:

    ```cpp
    while ( rgch[ i ] != '\\' )
        i++;
    ```

   This might index a trail byte, not a lead byte, and thus it might not point to a `character`.

- Use the [_mbclen](../c-runtime-library/reference/mbclen-mblen-mblen-l.md) function to solve the preceding problem:

    ```cpp
    while ( rgch[ i ] != '\\' )
        i += _mbclen ( rgch + i );
    ```

   This correctly indexes to a lead byte, hence to a `character`. The `_mbclen` function determines the size of a character (1 or 2 bytes).
