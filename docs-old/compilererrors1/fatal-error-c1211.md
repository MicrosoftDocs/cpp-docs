# Fatal Error C1211
The TypeForwardedTo Custom Attribute is not supported by the version of the runtime installed  
  
 C1211 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.  
  
 Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.  
  
 To resolve C1211 install the common language runtime that shipped with the compiler you are using.  
  
 For more information, see [Type Forwarding (C++/CLI)](../windows/type-forwarding--c---cli-.md).
