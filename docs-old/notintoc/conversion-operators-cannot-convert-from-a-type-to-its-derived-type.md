# Conversion operators cannot convert from a type to its derived type
A conversion operator is declared with a return type that derives from the parameter type.  
  
 At compile time, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../cli/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] considers a predefined conversion to exist from any reference type to any type in its inheritance hierarchy, that is, any type from which it derives or which derives from it. Such a conversion might fail at run time, but the compiler cannot predict run-time results, so it allows any such conversion to compile.  
  
 Because the compiler considers this conversion to be already defined, it does not allow you to redefine it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33027  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove this operator definition entirely. It is already predefined.
