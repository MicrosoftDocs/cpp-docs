# Attribute cannot be used because it does not have a Public constructor
The constructor for the attribute being used is `Private`, and cannot be used.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30758  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  If you see this error with a custom attribute that you developed, change its `Sub``New` constructor's access modifier to `Public`.
