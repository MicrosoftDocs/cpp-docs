# Unable to read the resource information from the resx file
The project system could not read a .resx file.  
  
 An operating-system specific reason (if any) will be appended to the end of this message. The file name of the file that could not be read will also be appended.  
  
 Some possible reasons for this error include lack of permission to read the files, or (for Web projects) loss of communication with the Web server.  
  
 This error will cause the build process to fail.
