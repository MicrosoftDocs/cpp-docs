|[operator new](../Topic/operator%20new%20\(%3Cnew%3E\).md)|The function that's called by a new-expression to allocate storage for individual objects.|  
|[new Operator](../cpp/new-operator--c---.md)|Allocates memory for an object or array of objects from the free store and returns a suitably typed, nonzero pointer to the object.|  
|[new (new slot in vtable)](../windows/new--new-slot-in-vtable----c---component-extensions-.md)|In a C++/CLI project, indicates that a virtual member gets a new slot in the vtable. In other words, the function does not override a base class method.|  
|[ref new, gcnew](../windows/ref-new--gcnew---c---component-extensions-.md)|In a [!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../buildref/includes/cppwrt_short_md.md)] (`ref new`) or C++/CLI (`gcnew`) project, this compound keyword creates a reference-counted object.|
