# Dynamic Object Creation
This article explains how to create an object dynamically at run time. The procedure uses run-time class information, as discussed in the article [Accessing Run-Time Class Information](../mfc/accessing-run-time-class-information.md).  
  
#### To dynamically create an object given its run-time class  
  
1.  Use the following code to dynamically create an object by using the `CreateObject` function of the `CRuntimeClass`. Note that on failure, `CreateObject` returns **NULL** instead of raising an exception:
