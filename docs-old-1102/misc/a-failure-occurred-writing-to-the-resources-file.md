# A failure occurred writing to the resources file
The .resources output file could not be written by the project system. As part of preparing resources, the project system will transform XML files with a .resx extension into binary .resources files for the .NET Resource Manager.  
  
 An operating-system specific reason (if any) will be appended to the end of this message. The file name of the .resx file will also be appended.  
  
 This error will cause the build process to fail.
