# Definition of method &lt;method&gt; is not accessible in this context
An aggregate function that does not exist has been included with the `Into` operator.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36594  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Check the spelling of the aggregate function name and make any necessary corrections.  
  
-   Add the method as a custom aggregate function (extension method). For more information about creating a custom aggregate function, see [Aggregate Clause](../Topic/Aggregate%20Clause%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md).
