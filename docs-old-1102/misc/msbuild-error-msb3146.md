# MSBuild Error MSB3146
**MSB3146: Item '\<package>' is required by '\<package>', but was not included.**  
  
 This error occurs when one bootstrapper package depends on another, but you have selected to install only the dependent package. For example, package B depends on package A, but only B is installed.  
  
### To correct this error
